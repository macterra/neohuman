1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
You do need to have a stronger force than people that invade you.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,840
Yeah, that's my whole point.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,520
I agree, but I don't think you have to run a protection racket to get that stronger force.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,040
So rather than have a government and all of the huge financial burden that that encompasses,

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,760
you have private companies.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,760
You have private security forces, and those private security forces are part of a consortium

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,400
that makes the rules, and all the private companies pay into the consortium to keep it going.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,400
And if any of them breaks the rules, then they get kicked out of the consortium.

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,280
Well, who will own the nuclear weapons? Because they exist right now, already.

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,440
That's what I'm talking about, that right now, what are our options? Because what happened in

11
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,080
Seattle with respect to- Yeah, this can't change overnight.

12
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:02,880
No. You'd have to probably dismantle the nuclear weapons over a period of decades.

13
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,720
Exactly. If not centuries.

14
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,720
Yeah, it could be a long time.

15
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:23,280
You know, good and bad, it's so subjective, and I think this is actually a good point of beginning.

16
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,000
If you guys are comfortable with start at this point, that a lot of what we're going through

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,640
right now as a society is, again, I go back to what we were talking about last time.

18
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,680
It's the matter of this alignment issue and alignment challenge, or whatever you want to

19
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:49,520
call it, that there is a narrative that is being offered, basically, or demanded maybe by a

20
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,960
centralized structure of authority, whether it's a government, or an agency, or a department,

21
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,600
or a local government, or anything like that. And people have their own interpretation of it

22
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,240
because of the social media, because people just talk to each other and they come to different

23
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:13,680
kind of a conclusion. And I think this is an inherent addition of our time that is

24
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,480
expanding this gap that has existed between us further and further.

25
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,280
Who is us here? Between us humans?

26
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,880
Us humans. You know, like what is the big picture of-

27
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,680
You're lumping all humanity into one pile?

28
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,800
Well, in one pile of disagreeing with each other, absolutely.

29
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,600
Okay, that's fair enough.

30
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,840
Because what is that one objective, big picture-wise, that the entire humanity is following?

31
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,280
This is something I actually ask Michio Kaku whether or not we can consider type one civilization

32
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,800
based on Kardashev's scale as some kind of an objective scale that would become a planetary

33
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,200
civilization, because we're not even type one now, we're type zero. But

34
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,040
Were we ever type one, and we regressed, or we haven't got to type one yet?

35
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,960
No, we haven't got to type one yet. So, Michio Kaku was saying that this is actually the most

36
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:20,160
sensitive and risky kind of a situation to transfer from type zero to type one. We're either

37
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,600
going to make it, or we're going to destroy ourselves. But at the same time, a lot of the

38
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:31,520
addition required to become type one civilization are a lot of things that we're going to have to

39
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,760
become type one civilization are a lot of things that we are arguing against right now. This kind

40
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:44,480
of monopolized narrative, for example, on climate, or monopolized narrative on taxation, monopolized

41
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,240
narrative on culture, on values. Great.

42
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,080
But what defines a type one civilization?

43
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:03,040
So type one civilization is a planetary civilization that would use all the

44
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:10,640
resources of the planet, basically, in order to be able to use them for whatever kind of objective

45
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:19,120
that we have. So weather, all the elements of the planet, basically. So we are not that,

46
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,400
at this point, because we're using dead plants and dead animals, oil and gas and carbon

47
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:33,360
as a source of energy. By the time we get to a point that we can, again, we're already in a very

48
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,120
controversial kind of area, because some people would say, aha, he's a globalist, because he's

49
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,680
advocating for controlling the weather, which is true. But at the same time, you don't want

50
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,000
a single government to be in charge of the weather.

51
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,280
Some people do. Some people want a global government that is their end game.

52
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,280
Yeah. And that's a problem, right?

53
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,520
That is one way forward, is to have a monoculture, a global culture that is the same everywhere.

54
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:10,160
Well, we're working on that one. Unfortunately, it's not our culture.

55
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,520
Well, what is our culture? What is our culture? You're talking about the Western culture.

56
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,160
As one example, correct.

57
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:25,840
Right. Who do you think is doing a better job at this point, establishing that one culture, or one

58
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:26,720
civilization?

59
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,840
Well, I hate to use the word better in that sentence, but I think the CCP is pushing pretty

60
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:41,680
hard at promoting their version of reality. And we seem to be, when our Prime Minister proclaims

61
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:49,040
that he envies what the CCP is doing and how they're doing it, then you have to sort of sit

62
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,320
back in your chair and go, really? I mean, what's going on here?

63
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,920
Yeah, basic dictatorship.

64
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:02,960
I mean, that's the right answer. I'm not sure he grasps that or views it that way, but that's my

65
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,480
interpretation of what he said.

66
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,960
What do you think, David?

67
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:14,960
Would you say CCP is the largest single culture in the world today, in terms of people?

68
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,200
Like, you wouldn't say the Western culture is a single culture, would you? Or do you put that at

69
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,400
the same level as…

70
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:30,400
Well, I think Judeo-Christian, if you put it in that label, then you raise it to that abstraction,

71
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,240
and then we're a pretty large entity. I don't know, what would the numbers look like compared to…

72
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,240
Judeo-Christian is over 2 billion, and CCP is under 2 billion.

73
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:51,280
But CCP is not a culture. CCP is a gang, basically, that has taken over a country.

74
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:59,200
And the nationalist Chinese who fled China to Taiwan, those are the people who inherit

75
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,920
the Chinese culture. It goes back 5,000 years or whatever. So CCP's culture is a politically driven

76
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,080
culture of domination. That's what it is.

77
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:21,040
And because of the kind of technology and the will and the ability to use the technology,

78
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:29,680
there is a very good chance that they can dominate, I don't want to say the entire of the globe,

79
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:36,480
but most of the globe, with the same kind of a… same kind of…

80
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:43,280
Outreach that they have practiced very successfully within Mainland China.

81
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:56,400
And yeah, I just think back at university now in retrospect, and it was happening then in the 70s

82
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:04,640
already. That sort of indoctrination was going on at all sorts of levels, which is why we have the

83
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:17,840
social crisis we do in the West now, because that embracing of communism and socialistic ideology

84
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:27,200
a.k.a. postmodern a.k.a. Marxism, has really just become a subtext to so much of our civilization.

85
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,280
And I don't think most people realize how it's been inculcated in so much of our civilization,

86
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,720
and what the consequences are. I mean, I talk to the people in the United States,

87
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,800
I talk to the people in the United States of America, I talk to the people in the United States

88
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:49,440
of America in Pois родin, I talk to the people in the United States of America in Washington.

89
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,320
And what the consequences are. I mean, I talk to the people I talk to in those comments I see

90
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:03,040
just on Facebook and around, you talk to people, I don't think most people get what's going on.

91
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,240
I think there… there is a bit of an awakening now with what's happening with Antifa and the riots

92
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,320
doesn't make sense. But I'm not sure how many people actually get the underpinnings

93
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,800
that are in place that support this sort of narrative. I mean, it's really deeply steeped

94
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:31,500
in our society. And I'm not sure how you unpack that anymore. That's my biggest concern now.

95
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:39,600
Can this be taken apart and the good parts kept? Because there are. I mean, we have to

96
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:48,120
look after each other, that's for sure. But I don't know if we can unpack this in a civilized

97
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:59,200
way, unravel it without, you know, battlegrounds being laid and just, you'd hate to use the

98
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:08,280
word civil war, but there are hints of that possibility in the way this is playing out.

99
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:15,840
It's going to be very important for whoever gets elected in the US, I think predominantly

100
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:24,680
because Europe is somewhat lost, to be able to set a tone and most importantly, be able

101
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:30,960
to set a tone in a way that everyone can get be part of. And I'm not sure how to do that,

102
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:37,960
how that can be done at this point. But short of that, I think, you know, China is going

103
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,760
to get more and more traction as their propaganda. I mean, we were looking at those stories earlier

104
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:52,440
were CBC and the Guardian are all saying Russia is invading our research into the COVID vaccines.

105
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:58,120
But maybe that's true, maybe it isn't, but they're probably the least of our concerns

106
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:05,360
in terms of people that are actually doing that, right? And to what end? And then nowhere

107
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,080
in those narratives does it talk about are they doing any damage? I mean, we probably

108
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:17,640
should be sharing that kind of research around the world if we're succeeding. But my biggest

109
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,520
concern was if they're sabotaging any of it, you know, by playing with data, but no

110
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:33,080
one even casually mentions that risk. So Russia keeps getting pushed up as the villain and

111
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:44,000
I find it astounding, utterly astounding that no one is publicly stepping up in the mainstream

112
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,360
and calling China out. And every time Trump does, he's vilified.

113
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,680
Well that's one of the reasons that they are not talking about China is because Trump is

114
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:01,320
talking about it. I don't know if you saw today that Nancy Pelosi called COVID Trump

115
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,400
virus, which is just mind blowing.

116
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:13,840
Well but then you saw on Church of the Virus there, I posted a link from MedCram and the

117
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:22,080
opening tagline was CCP virus explained. And someone was really mocking me and just shaking

118
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:30,960
his head at me for using that term. So you're not allowed to pick on China apparently.

119
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:37,200
Well I'll tell you this, David, do you have any kind of perspective on this before I get

120
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
into my perspective?

121
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:45,160
Hurry up, David, quick, quick, something. Don't let him get rolling again.

122
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,000
I defer to you, I want to hear your perspective.

123
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:58,320
Okay I'm not going to let this go now.

124
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,560
Well I think it's very clear why people are not talking about China is because they're

125
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:12,920
invested in what China represents, which is providing a low regulation kind of a ground

126
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,960
so you can do whatever you want to do. You don't have to treat your workers well, you

127
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:25,280
don't have to pay them well, you can use slave labor and just make money basically out of

128
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:31,040
the entire operation. And a lot of people within the United States, not only media and

129
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,720
a lot of people within the Democratic Party, but a lot of the media apparatus, they're

130
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,440
heavily invested in this whole order that really has been established since after World

131
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:50,760
War II, which is basically about mixing US economy with global economy. That's what

132
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,520
this whole thing has been all about.

133
00:13:53,520 --> 00:14:00,520
And at the same time we're going through this cultural shift from having some kind of a

134
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:08,960
set narrative based on very limited channels of interpretation and distribution of information

135
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:18,040
to this explosion of platforms and ability for people to express themselves. And I feel

136
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:24,200
like we're like monkeys given machine guns and we're just going insane with the use of

137
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:31,360
Twitter and different kinds of social media and that deepfakes are coming. We can't just

138
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,440
make up stuff from scratch because media and a lot of people are already doing it by editing

139
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,880
videos in the way that they want to represent it. But when you can just make up something

140
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,740
from the scratch, something that has absolutely no basis on reality whatsoever and half the

141
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:55,760
population would believe it and make political decision on that basis. I think we're in complete

142
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:02,360
uncharted territories and regardless of whoever is going to be elected in November, it's

143
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:13,000
going to be a complete mess. But the silver lining in all of this to me is that a lot

144
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:21,040
of what we are relying on to evaluate whether as good or bad, they're not as solid as we

145
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:27,860
think they are. Let's say, for example, the Democratic Party right now that is practically

146
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:33,500
a Trojan horse for whoever that is willing to join them against United States, which

147
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:40,400
is I think my argument against the point you made, Fritz, that a lot of these people are

148
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:47,440
not pro any specific kind of a system. They're against the system and that is the capitalist

149
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:54,880
American and as they put it racist system of the West that they see no value in it whatsoever

150
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,880
because of whatever that they've learned and whatever that they believe. But it's not like

151
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,200
they're hardcore communist or the hardcore Marxist. There are people who are hardcore

152
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:12,480
communists and hardcore Marxist among them. But my point is that this is a massive tent

153
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,800
against America and against capitalism and against the West. And at the same time, on

154
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:24,440
the other side of the equation, you see that Trump has created his own version of a massive

155
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:32,520
and expanded tent against this narrative that no, America is good. We've achieved a lot.

156
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,680
German civilization is the most successful civilization in the world. It's pulled out

157
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:45,360
majority of people out of poverty because of capitalism. And so I think Zizek said it

158
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,920
best that at this point, this is a moment of philosophy that we are at the level that

159
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:58,000
we're talking about. Hey, what do we need? What is the definition of civilization? What

160
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:08,800
is the definition of a society? What are the values that worth preserving or we have the

161
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:16,280
obligation of destroying? So that's what we are talking about. It's not like we are headed

162
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:21,160
towards any kind of a specific direction in either way, whether against the West or for

163
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:28,120
the West in favor of CCP, which we are not majority of the world, including majority

164
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:35,480
of the Chinese people are not in favor of the CCP. But at the same time, if United States

165
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:44,040
is so divided that you elect anybody in November 3rd or November 4th, and half the country

166
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,600
will be like, it's not my president. I'm just not going to listen to this person. I don't

167
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,100
care who he is. I'm not going to follow it. And we see the traces of it right now that

168
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,800
some states are saying, we don't care if you're going to send send federal troops. We're not

169
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:03,680
going to we don't want them. You know, Portland is saying it right now. Pennsylvania, I'm

170
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:08,600
sorry, Philadelphia said it yesterday, New York is saying it there you you bring federal

171
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,360
troops, we might end up arresting the federal troops. And that is exactly what will lead

172
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:21,880
to civil war quite possibly. And the gap that will that will be created as a result of this

173
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:28,400
will be perfect for anybody to step in, you know, it could be partially CCP, it could

174
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,040
be partially Hezbollah and Iran, could be partially Muslim Brotherhood, and it could

175
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:38,280
be partially countless number of militias that already exist in United States and take

176
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:43,760
over this country. And basically, it's the end of United States as a union.

177
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:53,800
So going back to Portland, are there already federal agencies in Portland? Yeah, like who

178
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,800
who who are the ones that are in unmarked uniforms, picking off protesters and throwing

179
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:05,320
them in unmarked? So actually, that is that is fake news. They are not unmarked uniforms.

180
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,840
What they don't have is their names. They don't have name tags because they've been

181
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,680
doxxed before. And that is that is the game that is being played that Oh, look, they're

182
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:19,360
not then they're not identifying themselves. But they're not identifying themselves because

183
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:25,080
they've been doxxed. Okay, but are they feds? Their homeland, their homeland security and

184
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:30,920
their feds defending the federal courthouse that these people have been trying to set

185
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:38,800
on fire for days now. All right. I don't know if you saw the footage of some of these I

186
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:45,840
don't call them protesters. They're not even rioters. These are, I guess, insurgents revolutionaries,

187
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,120
because there's no point of discussion. There is no point of argument. The point of the

188
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,000
revolution for them is the revolution. They want to topple the system. That's that's

189
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,760
what they want. And let me actually share this link with you. Because I think this is

190
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,440
interesting that we're talking about it right now. That this I think Portland is very interesting

191
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:12,560
because this is how it could start. This could be if that spreads to other cities. Yeah,

192
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:19,280
absolutely. Absolutely topple the US. So this gentleman, he's president of Portland Police

193
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:25,680
Union, who's been targeted by in protests, and he said that the community has had enough

194
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:32,080
now he looks like a black American, but we don't know because if he is going to vote

195
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,160
for Joe Biden, then he will be considered black. If he's not voting for Biden, then

196
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:43,560
he ain't black. According to Biden, of course, we know that. But he said the elected officials,

197
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:49,040
the elected officials meaning the mayor and anybody who's allowing this insanity to go

198
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:55,520
on I believe today is the 55th day that this mess has been going on. He said that the elected

199
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:01,880
officials have condoned the destruction and chaos at Turner, they have placed a political

200
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:07,580
agenda ahead, ahead of safety and welfare of the community. This must stop. He's also

201
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:13,240
said that this is no longer about George Floyd, racial equality, racial equity, social justice

202
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:20,440
reform, or the evolution of policing. Turner said this is about violence, rioting and destruction.

203
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:26,880
Our city is under siege by rioters. And I think that's absolutely spot on. You know,

204
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:35,360
and this is the head of the police union in Portland. So people who are watching what's

205
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,880
going on and there are a lot of them because there is nothing else to do right now in United

206
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:45,560
States other than watching stuff. You can go out, there is a curfew in a lot of places

207
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:54,880
including Florida. They are watching this insanity and people don't want that. People

208
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,640
don't want their cities and their neighborhoods to be burned to the ground because of racism

209
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:04,360
or whatever it is. You know, but this is, this is a narrative that is going nowhere

210
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:10,480
because they have redefined racism altogether. That any kind of a system that leads to this

211
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:18,600
kind of an inequality, according to them, is nonsensical, you know, by design. All it

212
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:24,320
has to be toppled altogether. It has to be destroyed and something else come in the place

213
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,400
of it. So I totally agree with Fritz that there is no civil way to get out of this.

214
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,840
And I don't know, but what I do know is that absolute majority of people are not in favor

215
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:44,120
of it. Well, how many people are actually actively

216
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:51,960
part of this rioting? And I think that's probably the correct word because it ain't protesting.

217
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,840
No. Like what? I can never find what kind of numbers

218
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:02,560
because when I think back in the 60s or when all the riots were going on, you know, half

219
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:08,600
of LA gets burnt to the ground or a large, several city blocks get burnt to the ground.

220
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:15,520
Students get gunned down, you know, university campuses. You had a sense of numbers and people

221
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,760
and the protests. I mean, when, when you look at the marches, the million man marches on

222
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:29,400
Washington and the civil rights movement, it was very real. But what I see now is like

223
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:35,160
something out of a video game where you're getting this very narrow myopic view of what's

224
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:43,000
going on. And do we have any handle on how many people are actually destroying everything

225
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,760
for everyone else? And how much of this is? And it was initially the media was just driving

226
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:53,160
this. And then I think at some point, the mainstream media clue it into the fact that

227
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:57,940
this was helping Trump. So now they've backed way off and you don't see a lot of this stuff.

228
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:04,760
Not all of them though, they're, they're capitalizing a lot on this fact that people

229
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:11,680
coming in unidentified cars and just snatching people off the street. Nancy Pelosi called

230
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:19,200
them Trump stormtroopers. Right. But that's the back end, right? They never show the Apple

231
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,400
store day before yesterday when the rioters were there, the actual riot, the stuff that,

232
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:33,560
you know, that would drum up anti rioter, that stuff's not so there always, there's

233
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:38,560
always this backhanded stuff that's in the media now. If they can spin it as an anti

234
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:45,200
Trump thing, then it makes the news. But actually, you know, showing what's actually going on

235
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,260
the day to day because there's a lot of looting and rioting still underway. And I don't see

236
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:59,160
that in the media as Yeah. Yeah, I don't know about the exact numbers. But I do know that

237
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,720
a lot of people within the Democratic Party, and this is one of the reasons that I am not

238
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:10,520
as terrified as I was maybe two months ago, with respect to the prospect of Democrats

239
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:16,400
winning in November, because the moment they win, their own civil war will continue because

240
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:22,960
this is not an ideologically unified group of people. Yeah. This is again, a tent that

241
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:32,640
has been set up around the animosity against Donald Trump. That's what it is. And GOP has

242
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,080
the same problem too, within the conservatives. Now we see that we have started to see a little

243
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:44,280
traces of it, that a unity that exists within the GOP and conservatives and evangelicals

244
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:49,540
and you know, it's a big tent on the other side too. It is around the support of Trump.

245
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:56,220
It's all about Trump. So good and bad and right and wrong and all of this is being defined

246
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:01,280
on the basis of whether or not you support or oppose Trump. But I think they're playing

247
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:07,880
an insane kind of a game. And I don't know when they're going to wake up because CNN

248
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:16,400
and CNN's office in Georgia was firebombed. And they couldn't believe it. Some leftist

249
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:26,480
publications offices were firebombed. The far left mayor of Portland House is a target

250
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:32,200
of the attack of the rioters. And this is the guy who has ordered the police in Portland

251
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,880
just to stay put, don't do anything, let them do whatever they want to do.

252
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:45,760
Well, it was interesting. I watched that video on Sunday on the grooming gangs in the UK.

253
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:53,160
What happened in the last 10 years in the UK is what we're seeing here now, where the

254
00:26:53,160 --> 00:27:00,280
political correctness is now impacting law enforcement, it's impacting the judicial system,

255
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:09,000
it's impacting the behavior of our elected people. And not in a good way. So it's about

256
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,200
right. I've always noted that we're five to 10 years behind Europe in our social behavior.

257
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,080
And so this was last 10 years, this has been unraveling in the UK. And now we're seeing

258
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:26,240
it here. Because when you look back over the last 10 years, the riots in London, the stuff

259
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,260
that was going on in the UK in terms of people beating each other up and the police just

260
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:39,280
stepping back, is what's happening here now. So it's, it's, yeah.

261
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,160
It's the same playbook. They're saying it very clearly. I don't know if you know this

262
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:52,200
woman Linda Sarsour, who is Linda Sarsour is a pawn of Muslim Brotherhood in United

263
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:59,560
States. She's not even hiding it. She's a hardcore, Marxist Muslim Islamist, who is

264
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,800
not in favor of two state solution. She's in favor of one state solution. And that one

265
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:10,680
state is Palestine. And she was one of the organizers of women's march that all of these

266
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:17,960
American women went with their pussy hats. Some of them wore US flag as a headscarves

267
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,760
that people like me coming from that part of the world will be like, are you out of

268
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:27,840
your freaking mind? What are you doing? Don't you see the big picture here? But it's the

269
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:35,840
same playbook. And they've said it repeatedly that we're the people who started spring Arab,

270
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:41,540
the Arab Spring in the Middle East and Northern Africa some 10 years ago, why can't we doing

271
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:46,680
it right here in United States? They're doing the same thing. The problem with United States

272
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:52,000
with all of this going on is that every single one of these actions are unconstitutional.

273
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,120
And people are losing their minds because a lot of the lawmakers and I'm talking about

274
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:04,380
Republicans who supposed to be standing up for constitutional rights of American citizens.

275
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:10,800
They're also sitting back very quietly, absolute majority of them, which reminded me of the

276
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:18,360
Conservative Party in Canada, that instead of standing up for your principles and values,

277
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:27,200
the solid ground that has basically preserved your validity to exist within this dynamic,

278
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:34,120
they're giving it up all for the sake of public opinion, mob opinion, basically.

279
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:40,000
Well, the ability to do to do to dox people and destroy them on on, you know, it's, it's

280
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,960
unbelievable. Yeah, I just my summer, my summer reading was Don't Burn This Book and The Madness

281
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:52,240
of Crowds. And so I plowed through those, which was more books than I normally read

282
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:58,480
in a lifetime. But they were they're great bookends, those two books. And they and they

283
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,760
they have very different information, but very similar sensibilities and where they're

284
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:12,120
coming from. And I mean, Douglas Murray just he recants the story of 1990s, where he went

285
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:16,800
when he was doing research for a university paper, and he went into London to the communist

286
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:22,440
party headquarters and was invited and talked to the people and being gay, he was potentially

287
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,600
part of the solution. And they said in no uncertain terms in these meetings to when

288
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:34,720
Doug was there, Douglas Murray that we've lost the working class in England. The working

289
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:40,520
class don't support us anymore. Right. The working class have it too good. So we have

290
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:45,200
to weaponize new people and we're now targeting the women's the feminist movement, the gay

291
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,480
community, the trans community, we're targeting these people, and we're going to weaponize

292
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:58,920
them to promote our cause. And it's come to pass. It's just so sobering to hear that,

293
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:04,880
you know, emphatically documented. And then at the time, I would have shaken my head that's

294
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,560
not possible in our system. Our democracy is way too strong. But maybe that's one of

295
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:19,000
the weaknesses of democracy. That because everyone's individual rights are so important,

296
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:26,760
that leaves us vulnerable to divide and conquer. But I still keep thinking that the majority

297
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:33,800
of the people in the United States, the majority of people in Canada, don't support what's

298
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,800
going on.

299
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,800
No, they don't.

300
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:42,600
That's the most surprising thing about the left is they've lost the working class. The

301
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:48,760
left is divorced from the working class. Has that ever happened before in the history of

302
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,560
leftist politics?

303
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:56,240
But the answer is in that, isn't it? I mean, the solution is that should be so obvious

304
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:03,360
to the political people is right there. And yet they're playing into this small group

305
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,660
of people that are driving the narrative.

306
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:16,600
But I mean, even this coalition that you mentioned, women, LGBTQ, trans, even that is not a solid

307
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,600
kind of a coalition.

308
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,640
No, and Murray goes, that's what his book's about. He's showing how all these are fragmented

309
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,880
and fighting each other.

310
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:30,200
Yeah. The letter that just came out, it was signed by a whole bunch of people.

311
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,200
Harvard.

312
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:37,160
Indians cancel culture. But JK Rowling has been hammering on this trans issue for quite

313
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:45,680
some time because this is very obvious that for the sake of ideology, you want to erase

314
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:52,880
so much rights that women over many, many decades have fought for to gain.

315
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,380
Basically overnight, you expect them to give it up for the sake of an ideology with some

316
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:02,540
kind of a completely incoherent, obscure kind of an outcome. You don't know what you're

317
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:07,960
going for. You know what you're running away from, but you have no idea what you're running

318
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,960
towards.

319
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:15,600
I like Douglas Murray's analogy of, you know, we've all been on this train, we've all hashed

320
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:21,280
this stuff out and we've been streaming along and finally we're pulling into the station

321
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:28,040
and we can all get off this ideological train and work on the solutions we've come up with.

322
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:32,800
But instead of stopping the train, it's now full steam ahead into oblivion and no one's

323
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:38,040
had a chance to get off and benefit from all the things. I mean, when you look at what's

324
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:44,200
happened in all the various aspects of our culture, the level of openness and inclusion

325
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:51,240
is phenomenal. It's never been this great. And yet everyone wants to dismantle it now.

326
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:56,920
It's bizarre. And I agree with you that with no rhyme or reason, it's just destroyed for

327
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:07,360
destroying sake. You look back at, you know, I look back at the Russian Revolution and

328
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:13,920
the turn of the century and what was going on in the Soviet Union. And I mean, by God,

329
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:24,920
those people had a reason to be rioting. And then with that same logic and the same narrative,

330
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:32,880
we're now trying to destroy one of the best civilizations we've ever created. I mean,

331
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:41,240
what happens if all the protesters lost their iPhones? They were turned off. But no one's

332
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:47,120
even suggesting a simple solution like that. Just throw a dampening field on the downtown

333
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:52,600
area that they've, you know, they're occupied. Just put a dampening field on it and no phone

334
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:58,080
reception anymore. And see how long this, you know, they don't have to bring troops

335
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:02,720
in and start, you know, beating people up. Just use the technology against them.

336
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:11,560
You know, they're bringing troops because local law enforcement are refusing to, because

337
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:17,800
of the orders given to them by politicians to keep this nonsense under control.

338
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:24,280
Now is this, is this all, is this a democratic plan to discredit Trump?

339
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,920
Yes, absolutely. That's the narrative.

340
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:33,080
Because the cities that you're looking at who had riots, I believe 25 of them, 25 out

341
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:41,520
of 26, they're Democrat run and progressive Democrat run. And you look at their district

342
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:47,800
attorneys, a lot of people within their law enforcement and justice system. And when you

343
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:54,400
go back to who supported their campaigns, many of them, you get to George Soros. This

344
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:02,440
is insane because it's a very clear kind of a plan. It's a very clear kind of an approach.

345
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:08,240
They did it with climate. They did it in colleges and universities. And a lot of people raised

346
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:13,680
red flags and alarm about it. Nobody cared about unlike a bunch of kids just, you know,

347
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:19,720
it's not that important. Well, those kids who were yelling in colleges and universities

348
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:24,840
and shutting down and silencing speakers who disagree with them. Now they're controlling

349
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:31,120
certain corporations and offices and taking over different kind of positions that are

350
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:39,400
very, very effective. But it's also the media and big tech that all together, because these

351
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,500
are not their headquarters in America, but they're not American companies. These are

352
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:52,200
multinational companies owned by shareholders who are benefiting a lot from globalism. And

353
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,440
there is no reason for them to supporting Trump. Otherwise, if you want to think about

354
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:02,160
it, what Trump is proposing is far more in favor of the working class than the other

355
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,620
way around. Because the other way around is the reason that all of these jobs and manufacturing

356
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:12,240
plans have been sent to China to begin with. And these are the people that are looting

357
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:17,520
and destroying small businesses and making the argument that no, you have to keep your

358
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:23,520
business shut down. We don't want you to recover. Because if you recover and economy does well,

359
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,680
it's not going to be in favor of us. It's going to be in favor of Trump.

360
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:32,320
Well, so they're trying to recreate the impoverished class nationally.

361
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,280
I don't think they know what they're trying to do. They're trying to defeat Trump. That's

362
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,800
a thing. Everything is about Trump. They want to defeat Trump. And it shows to me how

363
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:48,440
desperate they are, that they're willing to go to this length, just to remove this

364
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:54,760
person because it's a very, very effective person. If you want to see things get even

365
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:00,600
crazier than they're going to get naturally for the rest of the year, just wait until

366
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:06,000
Trump perhaps get the third pick of the Supreme Court. If something happens to Ruth Bader

367
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,440
Ginsburg, who is now again dealing with cancer. Can you imagine that in the middle of all

368
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:18,960
of this? Because hey, we are entering a hurricane season. We already entered hurricane season,

369
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:25,320
but hurricanes usually hit the parts of United States that usually get hit by hurricanes,

370
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:31,160
including Florida around September, which is right before the election.

371
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:36,560
But even if she died tomorrow, there's no chance of confirming another Supreme Court

372
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,240
justice before the election.

373
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:44,440
Mitch McConnell said he would do it. Interesting. Yeah. Mitch McConnell last year said if there

374
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:50,680
is a vacancy, because I don't know if you remember, but he did not allow Obama to fill

375
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:59,560
the Supreme Court vacancy because he was the electioneer in 2016, which was probably the

376
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:08,560
most effective thing he's done ever in his entire life. Yeah. And he said it last year,

377
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,240
they asked him a question, are you going to do it? He said, absolutely, they're going

378
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:18,360
to do it. And they can do it because they have majority in the Senate.

379
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,360
Is that all they need?

380
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,360
Yep.

381
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,840
Just passionately, sorry, go ahead.

382
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:27,960
No, no, no. I was just going to mention that they can do it because of the rule that Democrats

383
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:34,040
put in place that you don't need 60. Basically, they got rid of the nuclear, they got rid

384
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:40,600
of they call something. They went in favor of something called nuclear option that you

385
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:47,400
don't need 60 votes, you only need 51 votes to pass to pass the judicial appointments

386
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:55,320
for Obama because the Republican led Senate wasn't going along with them. And you know,

387
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:02,240
when when I'm sorry, Democrats, Republicans were not going along with them. So they lowered

388
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:07,080
the requirement to 51 instead of 60 people in the Senate, so they can just pass, pass

389
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:12,720
the judicial nominees. And when Republicans got a hold of Senate, they lowered that standard

390
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:18,600
for Supreme Court nominees as well. So they only need 51. That's that's how they pass

391
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:25,080
Gursuch. That's how they pass Kavanaugh. And that's how they will be able to pass.

392
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,920
It's going to be a woman, Amy, Amy Coney Barrett, I think is the next in line who's going to

393
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,800
replace whoever is going to be the vacancy in the Supreme Court.

394
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:42,040
But you know, when I watch Robert Barnes on talk shows, the American civil rights lawyer,

395
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:46,920
he talks about he doesn't understand what the Democrats or anyone that side of the house

396
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:52,760
is talking about because the judges have been, you know, have been really good decisions

397
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:57,680
that the judges that Trump's put in place, and they aren't nearly as partisan as everyone

398
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:07,680
says they are. No, they're not. So if less partisan, I mean, so that's really interesting.

399
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:13,260
That sort of contrast. Well, I mean, when they were protesting outside of the Supreme

400
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:18,920
Court when Kavanaugh name was announced as the nominee, they already had everything ready

401
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:26,080
with just the name spot being blank. So we're against blank. I'll just fill it in. Brett

402
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:32,440
Kavanaugh. They even sent a bunch of letters to some places with X instead of a name. They

403
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:39,520
just forgot to remove it because it has nothing to do with logic, reason, rationality. It

404
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,640
has everything to do with partisanship and tribalism.

405
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:53,760
But like, it just seems we're talking about all the ideologies and all that. But at a

406
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:00,760
grassroots level, you got to put food on the table, you got to have a job, you got to get

407
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:09,340
stuff done. If anything, the virus has shown us that we have to get on top of what we produce

408
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:14,440
locally on essential stuff. I mean, certainly, there's no reason we can't produce all the

409
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:26,080
PPE equipment that we need locally. And that would be a narrative, just get her done, do

410
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:31,280
it locally, build stuff, make stuff, get people working together, look at what industries

411
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,440
or community can set up that works on a community level. All that's, that would all be such

412
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:43,120
a positive way to approach this. Small business base, small business base, but I don't see

413
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:49,240
anyone talking in those terms. But to be fair, the one person who, of all the people that

414
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:54,960
you'd least expect, has been Doug Ford, our Premier in Ontario, has actually been speaking

415
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:03,200
that and doing it. But I'm missing that in the US. I see it happening at some levels,

416
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,160
and it may be happening, you just don't hear about it. I don't know.

417
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:11,960
Well, they cannot talk about it because it is the people who are involved within the

418
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:18,320
establishment right now who are responsible for sending all the jobs basically to China,

419
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:24,480
for making United States dependent. 95 plus percent of antibiotics in United States is

420
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:34,000
coming from China. Right? So the situation is insane. And because these people are benefactors

421
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:42,120
and beneficiaries basically of this entire globalism that hey, we want slave market without

422
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:50,320
any kind of a regulation so we can produce cheap and sell for much, much more.

423
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:59,640
But I'm still, I mean, I hear that, and I don't argue against it. But the long game

424
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:07,000
would leave North America without a revenue stream for most people to buy the products.

425
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:13,920
So then what? It seems, it almost, I mean, you mentioned the name earlier, but it almost

426
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,040
looks like someone who's shorting the US economy and a bunch of people are shorting it, which

427
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:24,720
you know that there's been a history of people wanting to do that. I happen to follow what

428
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:32,600
went on with Elon Musk and Tesla, and the billions of dollars that have been put in

429
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:38,200
shorting Tesla, and they've lost, I mean, consistently lost every year now for the last

430
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:45,040
10 years, and they've tried really, really hard to slag, put them down, and they still

431
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:50,920
can't create a situation where their short puts make any money. They've lost millions

432
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:57,320
of dollars. So there's all this stuff going on behind the scenes that are, that make a

433
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,320
difference.

434
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:02,600
Hey, people notice. People notice. Let me share with you something they actually shared

435
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:08,680
with you guys yesterday. This is really, really interesting. And this is by Eric Weinstein.

436
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:15,240
This is not a right-wing insane person. Let's see if I can't find it here.

437
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,240
It's who you ask.

438
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:24,360
Yeah, yeah, exactly. Exactly. You're right. You're right. Let me, let me see if I can

439
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,360
find it.

440
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,360
I'm a big fan of the portal.

441
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,360
Yeah.

442
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,360
Yeah.

443
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,360
Very interesting perspective.

444
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,600
Well, it's his walking rant on racism.

445
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,600
Right.

446
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,200
That was brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

447
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,200
He's spot on.

448
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:45,160
That should have been mandatory viewing everywhere. And I don't know how much traction it got.

449
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:48,520
But I certainly passed it around to everyone. And everyone that I passed it to was blown

450
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,520
away.

451
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,000
Well, I can't share it with you guys, but I'm just going to read it to you. I shared

452
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,200
it with you the link yesterday on Facebook, but I'm just going to read it. He tweeted,

453
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:03,200
this is July 20th, I guess like a day, two days ago, that a surprising number of left-leaning

454
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:09,440
people are confiding to me that they are planning to vote for Trump for two different stated

455
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:16,200
leading reasons. A, Biden's mental decline. B, what is happening in the Pacific Northwest

456
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:23,600
with Democratic mayors, governors experimenting with non policing. And this is something that

457
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:29,840
I want to go even beyond that because people are seeing what we were talking about in the

458
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:35,160
beginning that this is about, Hey, whether your country, United States is good or it's

459
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:44,280
bad inherently. Now either it in either direction, you will have traces of the opposite and the

460
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:48,760
contrast. Like if it's bad, there are obviously some good, good about it. If it's good, there

461
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:54,920
are some bad about it. But the idea that you want to get rid of the entire system, you

462
00:46:54,920 --> 00:47:00,460
want to burn down everything and you expect people to pay for it along the way because

463
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:08,360
they're raising taxes. I just don't understand who can go along with it. But then the question

464
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:17,520
is how many people are aware of what is exactly going on? Because the Biden campaign are playing

465
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:23,480
it very, very smartly. Ben Shapiro today on Joe Rogan, he was talking about, there is

466
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:28,880
no way that you can be afraid of Biden because he's not even alive. How can you be afraid

467
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:39,880
of the corpse? I know the first reason that Einstein said that the leftists were confiding

468
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:45,840
in him that is due to Biden's mental state. Does that make any sense to you? Because if

469
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:50,680
that is the case, let's just take that as a given. Wouldn't that just mean power shifts

470
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:57,540
to the VP, whoever that is? Absolutely. Well, that's why Biden is once in a lifetime opportunity

471
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:04,840
for the extremists on that camp, that whoever is going to be the VP, Biden is basically

472
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:10,160
a placeholder. He's not going to be in charge because keep in mind, Biden is 78 and this

473
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:16,120
is as good as he gets right now. It's just going to get worse. And they're very aware

474
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:22,560
of it. And it's really insane that some people are more than willing to throw the entire

475
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:29,280
country under the bus, knowing this guy who you would not put in charge of taking care

476
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:39,620
of your kids by himself, like babysit your kid by himself. He's lost. It's a shell of

477
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:45,120
a human being. Unbelievable. I'm going to call it right now. Biden is going to pick

478
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:54,440
AOC as his VP because that would guarantee a win. I don't think he can do it because

479
00:48:54,440 --> 00:49:01,240
AOC is not the age requirement of becoming the president. And she's just on the backside

480
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:06,200
of plastic surgery. She's just coming. No, she is. She's just really got plastic surgery.

481
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:13,080
Yeah, she had a plastic surgery according to she's getting ready for the campaign trail

482
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:18,160
because she has sort of her resting face is a bit of a frown. So the guess is that's

483
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:22,480
what she had corrected. But that was on Scott Adams the other day. He was talking about

484
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:30,700
that. But she already is set to become the environmental advisor to the White House.

485
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:35,080
He already talked about it. AOC is going to be in charge of the environment, which means

486
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:44,520
no oil jobs, no gas jobs, no coil, no coal. He already said that Beto O'Rourke is going

487
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,960
to be in charge of guns. And Beto O'Rourke is a person who said, of course we're going

488
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:53,400
to take away your AR-15 and AK-47s. What kind of question is that? Of course we're going

489
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:59,380
to do it. And he's from Texas. And probably Elizabeth Warren is going to be in charge

490
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:08,920
of treasury. It's a disaster. It's a disaster for absolute majority of American people and

491
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:14,880
the Western civilization if the guy is elected. But the reason I said I'm not as terrified

492
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:21,920
as I was two months ago, I'm still very terrified about that prospect. But I'm not as terrified

493
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,440
as I was maybe two months ago because I see the inner fighting within them. And they're

494
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:30,520
shutting down speech. They're shutting down any kind of a debate because they know that

495
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:34,760
they lose any kind of a debate for this exact same reason that China isn't allowing any

496
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:49,100
kind of an open discourse. So those are traces of hope, which is the point of this show.

497
00:50:49,100 --> 00:51:02,240
So do you think Trump has a good chance? Of winning? This year, yeah. So there is on NPR,

498
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:07,920
there is a money tracker of how much Trump and Biden have raised in the 2020 election.

499
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:13,440
Let me try one more time and see if I can share it with you guys. This zoom is not exactly

500
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:18,080
my friend probably because of the Chinese Communist Party, but we don't know. They're

501
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:25,440
listening. They're listening. There we go. So money tracker, how much Trump and Biden

502
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:30,300
have raised in 2020 election. Now, I don't know if you guys have heard from the media

503
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:38,760
that Biden has been consistently for the past two months over raising compared to Trump,

504
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:43,680
which is complete nonsense. Because if you come down, you see it's only one of Biden's

505
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:52,280
PACs called Biden Victory Fund that's been out raising Trump. But the rest, and Trump

506
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:59,240
had had a head start, obviously, Trump has raised far more money than Biden. But what's

507
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:08,040
really, really interesting is based on counties. Look at this map. This is from 2019, people

508
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:16,520
who have given money to Trump campaign and Biden campaign. And you see on Trump, Los

509
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:26,240
Angeles County is number one in giving Trump money. More than it's given to Biden. Los

510
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,840
Angeles County, you would imagine that Los Angeles is one of those places that you would

511
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:37,920
imagine, oh, they're like solid blue. They're all in favor of Democrats. But no, Miami-Dade

512
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:43,200
is another interesting one with the amount of money that they've given to Trump. Broward

513
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:52,160
County, which is the county that we're in, one of the infamous counties in Florida, solid

514
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:56,360
blue, they've given more money to Trump than they give them to Biden. They've given more

515
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:05,080
than $2 million, almost $2.5 million to Trump, less than $1 million to Biden. So what's the

516
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:13,520
correlation like between funds and victory? Well, they have, obviously, the ability to

517
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:19,960
hire people underground. But historically, is there any correlation? I don't know about

518
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:26,880
that. That would be very interesting to see. At the same time, though, in 2016, Hillary

519
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:37,040
Clinton raised far more than Trump by a lot, and Trump ended up winning. Trump got far

520
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:44,120
more free publicity because they didn't take him seriously. So he does not have that advantage

521
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:52,240
now. He does not have that surprise factor. And now that the CPP have taken over Twitter

522
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:58,120
and embedded their bots into it when they took it down there last week, God knows what

523
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:02,480
will happen to all Trump's tweets in the future. Do you think it was the CCP? Because I'm also

524
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:07,720
hearing that they were patriots within Twitter, because one of the only accounts that was

525
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:13,240
not touched was Trump's account. Well, that was my initial response, because typically,

526
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:18,360
you know, 99% of the time it's done from the inside, something like that. No, it was done

527
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:27,760
on the inside. It was definitely an inside job. Yeah, but they had an insider help them.

528
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:34,400
Yeah, right. But what I wasn't clear what the outcome of that was. David, you get any

529
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:43,400
any hint like? No, well, there was the Bitcoin scam. The hackers paid a few hundred thousand

530
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:49,160
dollars before it was cut off. Apparently, they didn't make it because Coinbase blocked

531
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:56,440
those transactions. Okay. Yes. They blocked transactions after a point. But once it had

532
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:04,160
been sent to the address, they cannot get back. That's the nature of Bitcoin. However,

533
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:09,040
speculation was that this was just a distraction for something more sinister. But I haven't

534
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:15,120
heard any. That was my brain went right to that, you know, this is, it's too much of

535
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:19,200
a coincidence that this happened this close to the election. And we know how important

536
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:26,240
Twitter was to Trump. So I'm wondering if someone's trying to make Twitter less favorable.

537
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:32,480
Well, I mean, whatever the case is, I think this is very obvious that Twitter at this

538
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:38,760
point is a matter of national security. Because if you can break into someone's account with

539
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:44,560
that amount of influence, you can start World War Three. Just imagine somebody in Twitter,

540
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:50,080
some activists get into Trump's account, like been thinking a lot about it. Xi Jinping is

541
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:55,600
not going along with my narrative, no longer my friend. I'll talk to him through Rocketman

542
00:55:55,600 --> 00:56:02,380
or something like that. Right? What are you going to do about it? You know, it will be

543
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:07,840
like a Doctor Strange Love kind of a scenario. Yeah, that hey, that we just have an insane

544
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:14,640
person we're not actually sending you bombs. We have to retaliate. And YouTube seems to

545
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:20,800
be going spending going over time now shutting people down with very little explanation.

546
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,640
YouTube is just ridiculous. And I'm saying that as somebody who has a YouTube account

547
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:31,320
for a couple of years now and creating content, I just look at my subscriber number, it goes

548
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:39,640
up by like 200 and comes down by 200. And this is like within an hour. And they've deleted

549
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:43,720
my videos. And I don't have like huge amount of subscribers or followers or anything. I'm

550
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:52,560
shadow banned. I've been my account was suspended for three months last summer. But they're

551
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:57,040
doing it very obviously. They don't even care anymore. It's not like they're doing it in

552
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:01,320
a covert stealth kind of a way. They're just doing the ad. This is what it is, man. You're

553
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:06,600
not following the narrative. We're not going to favor you. Which Facebook, I'm sorry, Facebook's

554
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:13,760
doing the same. Yeah. Facebook. I mean, who knows? Who knows? Because Facebook supposedly

555
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:21,280
is still a little playing on the fence. Hopefully, Peter Thiel sort of, you know, kicks them

556
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:28,200
every now and then. Well, Peter, Peter Thiel is a very rational human being. His whole

557
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:36,520
thing is that it's never the worst or the best kind of a scenario. And he's more of

558
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:41,240
what what's happening right now. And what what can I make out of it? It's really interesting

559
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:45,160
to listen to him is one of one of the very few people who get a really good idea. He

560
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:50,040
actually was a person. And maybe seven, eight years ago, they talked about Elon Musk, what

561
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:53,680
you were talking about, that people are betting against him. I said never bet against Elon

562
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:59,640
Musk. That's right. No, I was meaning more the fact that he's a major shareholder at

563
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:05,560
Facebook. Yeah, he's I think he's still on the board as well. Yeah, yeah. So I wonder

564
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:11,640
if he pokes them every now and then. But I think they need they need to be made into

565
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:19,880
public utilities, like phones and electricity. But I was reading up on it. Bill Clinton in

566
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:27,280
the 90s said, Okay, you guys need a break to get rolling. So you're not publishing houses,

567
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:32,680
you get an exemption. Right. And all that has to be done is that exemption has to be

568
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:38,120
taken away. No legislation, no change in the rules. Just take the exemption away. And all

569
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:43,000
of a sudden, you know, YouTube and Facebook and Twitter are all publishing houses responsible

570
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:48,460
for their content. Isn't that the executive order that Trump signed? He's been trying,

571
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:55,360
but I haven't seen it roll. I miss that if he has. Yeah, I believe that he signed the

572
00:58:55,360 --> 00:59:05,360
executive order with respect to preserving free speech maybe on on on big tech platforms.

573
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:10,900
But there is what you're talking about. I can't remember something 35 or something like that.

574
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:17,000
It's called that yes, they're platforms, they're not publishers, therefore, they're not responsible

575
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:22,040
for what what's being published. But that was but that's an exemption they got. Yes,

576
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:28,040
that's the exemption and Facebook ruined their own chance and opportunity of making any kind

577
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:35,120
of an argument in favor of their exemption by removing the Federalist from Facebook making

578
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:42,240
the argument that some of the comments put under your post were in violation of our Terms

579
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:49,880
of Service. And that's what Eric blew everything up that like what are you talking about? Okay,

580
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:54,120
you know, it's the equivalent of I'm talking on a phone and they just shut me down because

581
00:59:54,120 --> 01:00:01,480
we don't like what you're talking about, basically. Right. So here is my solution.

582
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:10,500
Break him apart, make him into public utility. Put that entire database of big data into

583
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:19,000
a blockchain database and pay people for their data. Make people in this country shareholders

584
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:24,280
are what you're creating. Now, the only person who's talking about this is Andrew Yang, with

585
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:30,360
respect to he's calling it data dividend. When he said that I was so happy because that's

586
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:36,100
exactly what I was talking about. I would respect the UBI UBI I don't think it should

587
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:40,800
be tax funded. I don't think it should be an extension of a welfare state, which is

588
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:47,560
the far left wants to do it progressives want to do it. It should be funded by user data,

589
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:54,440
it will incentivize you to create more data, data creation will become your job. You're

590
01:00:54,440 --> 01:01:02,200
making money, you're part of the system. And this entire thing will be will be a public

591
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:06,760
in public interest rather than being just arm of the media mainstream media because

592
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,520
that's what it is right now.

593
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:17,040
Okay, yeah, I agree with you. And I think Yang was right on the money with that the

594
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:25,640
but to make that happen, if they're if they're made publishing houses, or if they're responsible

595
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:32,400
for their content again, then wouldn't it level the playing field and allow other people

596
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:37,840
to come up, because then they're big advantage that they don't have to put any energy into

597
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:42,960
policing their content, you know, except, you know, I suppose they are putting a fair

598
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:47,640
bit energy into doing that at one level. But if they were truly responsible legally for

599
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:53,200
the content on their sites, that would change how they could behave and what they could

600
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:58,160
actually do. And it would let other groups come up. And then the people that offer that

601
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:03,400
kind of a solution, we're okay, you're on our site, we'll, you know, we'll give you

602
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:09,240
a say in who's on the site with you will give you a piece of the data that we start collecting

603
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:14,680
and you become a shareholder in the company that could emerge. I'm always a little bit

604
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:23,840
skeptical in my old age of legislating or, or requiring that sort of a solution. Like,

605
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:28,640
I think it has to happen from the grassroots. There are already alternatives, like bit shoot

606
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:33,080
is an alternative, for example, to YouTube. But it's just a matter of the amount of users

607
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:38,920
and the amount of amount of data that these users have already created. Hey, think of,

608
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:46,960
for example, of the man who shall not be named Alex Jones, who was removed overnight. Yeah,

609
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:51,980
in a very, and I don't even like Alex Jones, I think everybody should be able to say whatever

610
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:57,360
they want to say, blah, blah, blah, blah, all of that. But the way that he was removed

611
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:07,440
in a very coordinated kind of a manner, you are basically destroying someone's livelihood,

612
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:11,840
because you don't agree with the narrative that is being shared. And that he had millions

613
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:17,440
and millions and millions of followers, millions and millions and millions of dollars made

614
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:23,540
for YouTube and Google because of his content. No, we just don't want to go away. But so

615
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:28,000
there's two solutions here I'm hearing. I mean, I'm coming from the perspective, let's

616
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:35,140
roll back, you know, 40 years in time. And if you have stuff up, you're a publisher.

617
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:40,020
That would be one and the other solution is what I'm hearing you're saying is, no, no,

618
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:49,480
you don't get to moderate or mediate the content, you're a utility. Right. So even you have

619
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:54,400
to go one of those two ways, but we're in this bizarre middle ground right now, because

620
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:59,040
of the political interests. I think we can do both of them. You make you make the publisher

621
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:06,720
argument. And immediately after that, you raise a national security threat argument.

622
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:14,280
Because that's exactly what it is. Yeah. So you set you set the new starting point for

623
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:19,640
whoever is coming next. Is it going to be parlor? Is it going to be bit shoot? Is it

624
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:26,760
going to be whoever? But at the same time, it is a national security threat. Because

625
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:34,440
this is not going to get any less complicated. And create a creating fake news, quote unquote,

626
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:41,200
is not going to get any harder. This would almost be a good time to just hope the other

627
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:51,600
fellow there and say, nationhood, national security, you know, protecting a way of life,

628
01:04:51,600 --> 01:05:07,080
how does that fit in to a worldview that where we don't have nations? Let's hear it. What

629
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:17,320
do you mean we don't have nations? Well, if we if we step away in Canada as a nation,

630
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:24,720
allegedly, some would argue that. But not true, though. There's a thing. Well, yeah,

631
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:29,720
there are tribal components. Yeah, we're post national. Yeah. But there's tribal components

632
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:38,080
to our existence. Human existence, there always have been tribal components. And our strength

633
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:44,520
has been that we can gather together to a whole bunch of tribes and agree on a common

634
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:54,120
goal. And that sort of left us with nations. And we've, we were starting goal. Pardon me?

635
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:57,320
Yeah, I don't agree with that. What's our common goal? Well, that's what I'm putting

636
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:05,160
on. Well, a common goal would be food production, sharing resources, providing services that

637
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:09,560
other group can't provide. You don't need that nation to provide food. Food was around

638
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:15,120
long before nations. But you didn't share it necessarily, or you didn't sell it back

639
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:23,720
and forth. Yep. People traded food before nations existed. But what's the argument not

640
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:33,200
to have nations? Like, how do you how do you frame that? At this point, right now? Nations

641
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:39,960
are a liability. We'd have nuclear wars if there weren't for nations. There would be

642
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:45,440
trade wars if there weren't for nations. We wouldn't have them. Is it nations or governments?

643
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:51,800
If you get rid of governments, and you have, let's say, because my argument, I don't think

644
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:55,640
that you can get rid of governments. And I am not against anything that exists, because

645
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:59,800
I think anything that exists exists for a reason, as a consequence of series of events

646
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:04,520
and the behavior of the system and all of that. But I think, for example, in case of

647
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:10,240
United States, government should be limited to the military. And I really can't think

648
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:17,880
of anything else that you just secure the borders. And you guarantee this the security

649
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:24,680
of of people who are within that structure. And that's the amount of that's the amount

650
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:29,480
of taxes that you pay to to preserve that kind of a service. And that's about it. And

651
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:35,960
you leave the rest to whatever whatever kind of an option that can survive the free market

652
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:36,960
competition.

653
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:43,340
Okay, what you just described is a protection racket. What is that protection and protection

654
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:50,720
racket? Yeah. So that's when organized crime moves in and says that you have to pay for

655
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:55,680
our protection. Yeah. If you don't if you don't pay, your business will likely catch

656
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,600
on fire. Shame about that.

657
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:03,120
Yeah, I don't think there is any any way around that whatsoever. I think bigger you get bigger

658
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:08,720
share you have to pay to deal with bigger, bigger gangs, because your government is the

659
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:14,600
ultimate mafia. Yeah, exactly. So what's the what's the option? You don't think there's

660
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:23,360
any way around this? I think there is a way around the ethical arguments that we don't

661
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:32,200
need to have everything we can have certain amount of things to provide safety and happiness

662
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:39,980
and security and health and all of those things. But beyond that, it's it's a matter of greed.

663
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:43,800
If you want to go and deal with that, then there are people who are greedier than you

664
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:50,940
and they have bigger guns and bigger ammos and bigger, you know, more resources to take

665
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:59,760
away from you and from everyone else for their own sake. But I go back to 2001 Space Odyssey,

666
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:06,840
that the moment we have figured out how to use tools and weapons and anything, we use

667
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:14,240
that first to provide for ourselves. And then second to take it away from the competitor,

668
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:19,280
whoever that competitor might be, it just the nature of humanity. I don't believe that

669
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:29,240
if we don't have certain I just call them safety nets. If we don't have that, we're

670
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:37,820
just going to behave. I think people are as terrible as they are wonderful. And I think

671
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:45,800
if you're not protecting ourselves in different ways, there are people who are just going

672
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:52,640
to walk all over you because they have, again, bigger guns and more will and more ability

673
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:55,080
to take over your resources.

674
01:09:55,080 --> 01:10:04,440
Well, I'm I don't doubt that you need physical protection from bad guys. I never did.

675
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:12,160
How do you implement that in as an alternative to to a nation as an alternative to a protection

676
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:21,560
racket? Fair enough. You could do it with a consortium of security forces that are all

677
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:27,160
either for profit or charities. Isn't that exactly the protection racket in a different

678
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:39,320
way? No, because they they don't tax you. They don't force you to pay for them. But

679
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:46,000
you still have to pay. Oh, you would likely pay somebody to protect you just like and

680
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:56,300
they can be overrun by a stronger force. That's always the case. Well, exactly. Like what

681
01:10:56,300 --> 01:11:02,120
happened in Seattle? Were you following what happened in Seattle? You do need to have a

682
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:09,680
stronger force than people that invade you. Yeah, that's that's my whole point. I agree.

683
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:16,480
I don't think you have to run a protection racket to get that stronger force. So so rather

684
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:23,080
than have a government and all the huge financial burden that that encompass, you just you have

685
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:28,240
private company, you have private security forces and those private security forces are

686
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:34,320
part of a consortium that makes the rules and all the private companies pay into the

687
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:41,120
consortium to keep it going. Right. And if any of them breaks the rules, then they get

688
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:46,400
kicked out of the consortium. Well, who will own the nuclear weapons? Because they exist

689
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:52,920
right now already. That's what I'm talking about that right now. What are our options?

690
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:57,520
Because what happened in Seattle with respect to this can't change overnight. No, what would

691
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:03,920
you have to probably dismantle the nuclear weapons? Yeah, a period of decades. Exactly.

692
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:09,480
If not centuries. Yeah, it could be a long time. What happened in Seattle? I was actually

693
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:15,640
thinking about you because that's that's something we can talk. I think we we should move towards

694
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:21,000
wrapping this up. But that is something maybe we can talk next time that we come together.

695
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:29,360
But I was thinking about it because they started they call it Chaz as at first, which was Capitol

696
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:36,900
Hill Autonomous Zone. Yes, I remember Chaz. The first thing they did, they built a border

697
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:43,320
with walls. The second thing they did. Yeah, exactly. The second thing they did, they created

698
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:50,520
their own police force, beating people down, shooting people, interrogating them. And then

699
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:59,000
they changed their name to chop, which was Capitol Hill occupying protest, because they

700
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:04,400
thought of it, hey, if we're autonomous, how are we going to get water? How are we going

701
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:12,520
to get electricity? So I totally agree with you on the ethical and we had this conversation

702
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:18,400
before and the ethical sense of a way. But practically, I think it's never it's not going

703
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:25,160
to happen because of human nature, because we already have massive weapons already that

704
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:30,740
exists on this planet. And even if people that's one of the reasons I never agreed

705
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:36,200
with the Iran deal, Iran nuclear deal, I don't care how many paper they're going to sign

706
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:40,560
that they're going to, they're not going to build a nuclear bomb. If they can't build

707
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:49,280
a nuclear bomb, they're going to build a nuclear bomb. And for as long as this, which I think

708
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:56,120
is an inseparable part of human nature, that you just want to have more and more control

709
01:13:56,120 --> 01:14:01,480
over resources. And that's why we progress. But at the same time, that that's why we cause

710
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:08,440
a lot of trouble for each other and pain. Because we, we are hardwired in just gathering

711
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:12,520
more and more and more and more without really knowing why do we need all of these stuff

712
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:18,000
and putting everybody and including ourselves into a bigger kind of problems and continuous

713
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:27,040
kind of problems. I mean, I mean, I genuinely like what David's saying. And I get it. And

714
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:30,960
I understand what you're saying that how do we get there? Maybe we can establish smaller

715
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:38,200
communities based on that principles. Or, yeah, sure. That's the way to do it is just

716
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:45,680
imagine dividing up every state into counties and every county into city states and get

717
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:53,520
smaller and smaller. Yeah, decentralized as decentralized as it gets. Yeah. And maybe

718
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:59,520
regions like the West Coast and the East Coast have more in common to function as an entity

719
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:09,360
than forcing the East West trade that the nation states but my concern and maybe the

720
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:16,680
solution lies in the fact that you said it a guy that we were totally dependent on government

721
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:22,840
now it is the ultimate as David says, it's the ultimate racket. I mean, every every aspect

722
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:28,480
of our life is controlled, we're told, you know, from, you know, you got to do this,

723
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:32,280
you got to wear a mask, you're going to have to have a vaccination, you got to do this.

724
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:36,880
You can't open this, you can't close that. I mean, it's been really clearly shown how

725
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:46,080
much the government puts on the table that you have to do. So I think, you know, the

726
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:53,640
FDA, the environmental agencies, for example, that I mean, no need, the agricultural agencies,

727
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:59,000
you know, subsidizing farmers, all that stuff, I think, it can be tossed by the wayside and

728
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:07,500
then you're left with initially, just military, the justice system. And, and then the policing

729
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:14,760
falls back to the lower municipalities. Yeah. And at that point, you move forward, right.

730
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:22,280
And I think there is also a deeper layer at the core of governments. And that's, I think,

731
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:29,000
they're worth discussing that United States government, its sole job is to protect the

732
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:34,480
US Constitution. And the rights in the US Constitution are not coming from the man,

733
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:39,440
it's coming from the God. Now, what kind of a God, who that God is, that's a different

734
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:44,680
kind of a story. But I think that's the whole point of American exceptionalism, that when

735
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:50,400
the First Amendment is providing and guaranteeing your free speech, that is not the right that

736
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:57,720
is given to you by man, that is your natural right that is recognized by this legal document.

737
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:03,900
And the job of the government of United States is to protect that, versus job of the Chinese

738
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:09,240
Communist Party government is the man setting all the laws and all the rules and everybody

739
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:14,240
else should follow them. And that is exactly going back to what Zizek said, that is a moment

740
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:20,720
of philosophy that has that is created right now this opportunity for all of us to discuss.
