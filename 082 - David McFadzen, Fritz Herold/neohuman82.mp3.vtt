WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.360
You do need to have a stronger force than people that invade you.

00:05.360 --> 00:07.840
Yeah, that's my whole point.

00:08.560 --> 00:13.520
I agree, but I don't think you have to run a protection racket to get that stronger force.

00:15.920 --> 00:21.040
So rather than have a government and all of the huge financial burden that that encompasses,

00:22.720 --> 00:23.760
you have private companies.

00:23.760 --> 00:29.760
You have private security forces, and those private security forces are part of a consortium

00:29.760 --> 00:36.400
that makes the rules, and all the private companies pay into the consortium to keep it going.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.400
And if any of them breaks the rules, then they get kicked out of the consortium.

00:42.400 --> 00:47.280
Well, who will own the nuclear weapons? Because they exist right now, already.

00:48.800 --> 00:53.440
That's what I'm talking about, that right now, what are our options? Because what happened in

00:53.440 --> 00:56.080
Seattle with respect to- Yeah, this can't change overnight.

00:56.080 --> 01:02.880
No. You'd have to probably dismantle the nuclear weapons over a period of decades.

01:02.880 --> 01:04.720
Exactly. If not centuries.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.720
Yeah, it could be a long time.

01:14.960 --> 01:23.280
You know, good and bad, it's so subjective, and I think this is actually a good point of beginning.

01:23.280 --> 01:30.000
If you guys are comfortable with start at this point, that a lot of what we're going through

01:30.000 --> 01:34.640
right now as a society is, again, I go back to what we were talking about last time.

01:34.640 --> 01:39.680
It's the matter of this alignment issue and alignment challenge, or whatever you want to

01:39.680 --> 01:49.520
call it, that there is a narrative that is being offered, basically, or demanded maybe by a

01:49.520 --> 01:54.960
centralized structure of authority, whether it's a government, or an agency, or a department,

01:54.960 --> 01:59.600
or a local government, or anything like that. And people have their own interpretation of it

01:59.600 --> 02:04.240
because of the social media, because people just talk to each other and they come to different

02:04.240 --> 02:13.680
kind of a conclusion. And I think this is an inherent addition of our time that is

02:13.680 --> 02:18.480
expanding this gap that has existed between us further and further.

02:20.480 --> 02:23.280
Who is us here? Between us humans?

02:23.280 --> 02:28.880
Us humans. You know, like what is the big picture of-

02:28.880 --> 02:31.680
You're lumping all humanity into one pile?

02:31.680 --> 02:36.800
Well, in one pile of disagreeing with each other, absolutely.

02:36.800 --> 02:37.600
Okay, that's fair enough.

02:37.600 --> 02:43.840
Because what is that one objective, big picture-wise, that the entire humanity is following?

02:44.640 --> 02:51.280
This is something I actually ask Michio Kaku whether or not we can consider type one civilization

02:51.280 --> 02:56.800
based on Kardashev's scale as some kind of an objective scale that would become a planetary

02:56.800 --> 03:03.200
civilization, because we're not even type one now, we're type zero. But

03:03.200 --> 03:09.040
Were we ever type one, and we regressed, or we haven't got to type one yet?

03:09.040 --> 03:12.960
No, we haven't got to type one yet. So, Michio Kaku was saying that this is actually the most

03:12.960 --> 03:20.160
sensitive and risky kind of a situation to transfer from type zero to type one. We're either

03:20.160 --> 03:25.600
going to make it, or we're going to destroy ourselves. But at the same time, a lot of the

03:25.600 --> 03:31.520
addition required to become type one civilization are a lot of things that we're going to have to

03:31.520 --> 03:35.760
become type one civilization are a lot of things that we are arguing against right now. This kind

03:35.760 --> 03:44.480
of monopolized narrative, for example, on climate, or monopolized narrative on taxation, monopolized

03:44.480 --> 03:50.240
narrative on culture, on values. Great.

03:53.600 --> 03:56.080
But what defines a type one civilization?

03:56.080 --> 04:03.040
So type one civilization is a planetary civilization that would use all the

04:03.040 --> 04:10.640
resources of the planet, basically, in order to be able to use them for whatever kind of objective

04:10.640 --> 04:19.120
that we have. So weather, all the elements of the planet, basically. So we are not that,

04:19.120 --> 04:24.400
at this point, because we're using dead plants and dead animals, oil and gas and carbon

04:24.400 --> 04:33.360
as a source of energy. By the time we get to a point that we can, again, we're already in a very

04:33.360 --> 04:39.120
controversial kind of area, because some people would say, aha, he's a globalist, because he's

04:39.120 --> 04:45.680
advocating for controlling the weather, which is true. But at the same time, you don't want

04:45.680 --> 04:48.000
a single government to be in charge of the weather.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.280
Some people do. Some people want a global government that is their end game.

04:53.280 --> 04:55.280
Yeah. And that's a problem, right?

04:57.280 --> 05:03.520
That is one way forward, is to have a monoculture, a global culture that is the same everywhere.

05:04.640 --> 05:10.160
Well, we're working on that one. Unfortunately, it's not our culture.

05:11.120 --> 05:15.520
Well, what is our culture? What is our culture? You're talking about the Western culture.

05:15.520 --> 05:18.160
As one example, correct.

05:18.160 --> 05:25.840
Right. Who do you think is doing a better job at this point, establishing that one culture, or one

05:26.720 --> 05:26.720
civilization?

05:26.720 --> 05:31.840
Well, I hate to use the word better in that sentence, but I think the CCP is pushing pretty

05:31.840 --> 05:41.680
hard at promoting their version of reality. And we seem to be, when our Prime Minister proclaims

05:41.680 --> 05:49.040
that he envies what the CCP is doing and how they're doing it, then you have to sort of sit

05:49.040 --> 05:52.320
back in your chair and go, really? I mean, what's going on here?

05:52.320 --> 05:53.920
Yeah, basic dictatorship.

05:55.920 --> 06:02.960
I mean, that's the right answer. I'm not sure he grasps that or views it that way, but that's my

06:02.960 --> 06:04.480
interpretation of what he said.

06:05.920 --> 06:06.960
What do you think, David?

06:06.960 --> 06:14.960
Would you say CCP is the largest single culture in the world today, in terms of people?

06:16.080 --> 06:21.200
Like, you wouldn't say the Western culture is a single culture, would you? Or do you put that at

06:21.200 --> 06:22.400
the same level as…

06:23.280 --> 06:30.400
Well, I think Judeo-Christian, if you put it in that label, then you raise it to that abstraction,

06:30.400 --> 06:36.240
and then we're a pretty large entity. I don't know, what would the numbers look like compared to…

06:36.240 --> 06:42.240
Judeo-Christian is over 2 billion, and CCP is under 2 billion.

06:42.240 --> 06:51.280
But CCP is not a culture. CCP is a gang, basically, that has taken over a country.

06:51.280 --> 06:59.200
And the nationalist Chinese who fled China to Taiwan, those are the people who inherit

07:00.000 --> 07:07.920
the Chinese culture. It goes back 5,000 years or whatever. So CCP's culture is a politically driven

07:09.600 --> 07:14.080
culture of domination. That's what it is.

07:14.080 --> 07:21.040
And because of the kind of technology and the will and the ability to use the technology,

07:21.920 --> 07:29.680
there is a very good chance that they can dominate, I don't want to say the entire of the globe,

07:29.680 --> 07:36.480
but most of the globe, with the same kind of a… same kind of…

07:36.480 --> 07:43.280
Outreach that they have practiced very successfully within Mainland China.

07:48.000 --> 07:56.400
And yeah, I just think back at university now in retrospect, and it was happening then in the 70s

07:56.400 --> 08:04.640
already. That sort of indoctrination was going on at all sorts of levels, which is why we have the

08:04.640 --> 08:17.840
social crisis we do in the West now, because that embracing of communism and socialistic ideology

08:17.840 --> 08:27.200
a.k.a. postmodern a.k.a. Marxism, has really just become a subtext to so much of our civilization.

08:28.160 --> 08:33.280
And I don't think most people realize how it's been inculcated in so much of our civilization,

08:34.320 --> 08:38.720
and what the consequences are. I mean, I talk to the people in the United States,

08:38.720 --> 08:42.800
I talk to the people in the United States of America, I talk to the people in the United States

08:42.800 --> 08:49.440
of America in Pois родin, I talk to the people in the United States of America in Washington.

08:50.560 --> 08:56.320
And what the consequences are. I mean, I talk to the people I talk to in those comments I see

08:56.320 --> 09:03.040
just on Facebook and around, you talk to people, I don't think most people get what's going on.

09:03.040 --> 09:08.240
I think there… there is a bit of an awakening now with what's happening with Antifa and the riots

09:08.240 --> 09:14.320
doesn't make sense. But I'm not sure how many people actually get the underpinnings

09:14.320 --> 09:20.800
that are in place that support this sort of narrative. I mean, it's really deeply steeped

09:20.800 --> 09:31.500
in our society. And I'm not sure how you unpack that anymore. That's my biggest concern now.

09:31.500 --> 09:39.600
Can this be taken apart and the good parts kept? Because there are. I mean, we have to

09:39.600 --> 09:48.120
look after each other, that's for sure. But I don't know if we can unpack this in a civilized

09:48.120 --> 09:59.200
way, unravel it without, you know, battlegrounds being laid and just, you'd hate to use the

09:59.200 --> 10:08.280
word civil war, but there are hints of that possibility in the way this is playing out.

10:08.280 --> 10:15.840
It's going to be very important for whoever gets elected in the US, I think predominantly

10:15.840 --> 10:24.680
because Europe is somewhat lost, to be able to set a tone and most importantly, be able

10:24.680 --> 10:30.960
to set a tone in a way that everyone can get be part of. And I'm not sure how to do that,

10:30.960 --> 10:37.960
how that can be done at this point. But short of that, I think, you know, China is going

10:37.960 --> 10:42.760
to get more and more traction as their propaganda. I mean, we were looking at those stories earlier

10:42.760 --> 10:52.440
were CBC and the Guardian are all saying Russia is invading our research into the COVID vaccines.

10:52.440 --> 10:58.120
But maybe that's true, maybe it isn't, but they're probably the least of our concerns

10:58.120 --> 11:05.360
in terms of people that are actually doing that, right? And to what end? And then nowhere

11:05.360 --> 11:11.080
in those narratives does it talk about are they doing any damage? I mean, we probably

11:11.080 --> 11:17.640
should be sharing that kind of research around the world if we're succeeding. But my biggest

11:17.640 --> 11:22.520
concern was if they're sabotaging any of it, you know, by playing with data, but no

11:22.520 --> 11:33.080
one even casually mentions that risk. So Russia keeps getting pushed up as the villain and

11:33.080 --> 11:44.000
I find it astounding, utterly astounding that no one is publicly stepping up in the mainstream

11:44.000 --> 11:50.360
and calling China out. And every time Trump does, he's vilified.

11:50.360 --> 11:54.680
Well that's one of the reasons that they are not talking about China is because Trump is

11:54.680 --> 12:01.320
talking about it. I don't know if you saw today that Nancy Pelosi called COVID Trump

12:01.320 --> 12:06.400
virus, which is just mind blowing.

12:06.400 --> 12:13.840
Well but then you saw on Church of the Virus there, I posted a link from MedCram and the

12:13.840 --> 12:22.080
opening tagline was CCP virus explained. And someone was really mocking me and just shaking

12:22.080 --> 12:30.960
his head at me for using that term. So you're not allowed to pick on China apparently.

12:30.960 --> 12:37.200
Well I'll tell you this, David, do you have any kind of perspective on this before I get

12:37.200 --> 12:38.200
into my perspective?

12:38.200 --> 12:45.160
Hurry up, David, quick, quick, something. Don't let him get rolling again.

12:45.160 --> 12:50.000
I defer to you, I want to hear your perspective.

12:50.000 --> 12:58.320
Okay I'm not going to let this go now.

12:58.320 --> 13:03.560
Well I think it's very clear why people are not talking about China is because they're

13:03.560 --> 13:12.920
invested in what China represents, which is providing a low regulation kind of a ground

13:12.920 --> 13:16.960
so you can do whatever you want to do. You don't have to treat your workers well, you

13:16.960 --> 13:25.280
don't have to pay them well, you can use slave labor and just make money basically out of

13:25.280 --> 13:31.040
the entire operation. And a lot of people within the United States, not only media and

13:31.040 --> 13:36.720
a lot of people within the Democratic Party, but a lot of the media apparatus, they're

13:36.720 --> 13:43.440
heavily invested in this whole order that really has been established since after World

13:43.440 --> 13:50.760
War II, which is basically about mixing US economy with global economy. That's what

13:50.760 --> 13:53.520
this whole thing has been all about.

13:53.520 --> 14:00.520
And at the same time we're going through this cultural shift from having some kind of a

14:00.520 --> 14:08.960
set narrative based on very limited channels of interpretation and distribution of information

14:08.960 --> 14:18.040
to this explosion of platforms and ability for people to express themselves. And I feel

14:18.040 --> 14:24.200
like we're like monkeys given machine guns and we're just going insane with the use of

14:24.200 --> 14:31.360
Twitter and different kinds of social media and that deepfakes are coming. We can't just

14:31.360 --> 14:37.440
make up stuff from scratch because media and a lot of people are already doing it by editing

14:37.440 --> 14:43.880
videos in the way that they want to represent it. But when you can just make up something

14:43.880 --> 14:48.740
from the scratch, something that has absolutely no basis on reality whatsoever and half the

14:48.740 --> 14:55.760
population would believe it and make political decision on that basis. I think we're in complete

14:55.760 --> 15:02.360
uncharted territories and regardless of whoever is going to be elected in November, it's

15:02.360 --> 15:13.000
going to be a complete mess. But the silver lining in all of this to me is that a lot

15:13.000 --> 15:21.040
of what we are relying on to evaluate whether as good or bad, they're not as solid as we

15:21.040 --> 15:27.860
think they are. Let's say, for example, the Democratic Party right now that is practically

15:27.860 --> 15:33.500
a Trojan horse for whoever that is willing to join them against United States, which

15:33.500 --> 15:40.400
is I think my argument against the point you made, Fritz, that a lot of these people are

15:40.400 --> 15:47.440
not pro any specific kind of a system. They're against the system and that is the capitalist

15:47.440 --> 15:54.880
American and as they put it racist system of the West that they see no value in it whatsoever

15:54.880 --> 16:00.880
because of whatever that they've learned and whatever that they believe. But it's not like

16:00.880 --> 16:05.200
they're hardcore communist or the hardcore Marxist. There are people who are hardcore

16:05.200 --> 16:12.480
communists and hardcore Marxist among them. But my point is that this is a massive tent

16:12.480 --> 16:17.800
against America and against capitalism and against the West. And at the same time, on

16:17.800 --> 16:24.440
the other side of the equation, you see that Trump has created his own version of a massive

16:24.440 --> 16:32.520
and expanded tent against this narrative that no, America is good. We've achieved a lot.

16:32.520 --> 16:36.680
German civilization is the most successful civilization in the world. It's pulled out

16:36.680 --> 16:45.360
majority of people out of poverty because of capitalism. And so I think Zizek said it

16:45.360 --> 16:51.920
best that at this point, this is a moment of philosophy that we are at the level that

16:51.920 --> 16:58.000
we're talking about. Hey, what do we need? What is the definition of civilization? What

16:58.000 --> 17:08.800
is the definition of a society? What are the values that worth preserving or we have the

17:08.800 --> 17:16.280
obligation of destroying? So that's what we are talking about. It's not like we are headed

17:16.280 --> 17:21.160
towards any kind of a specific direction in either way, whether against the West or for

17:21.160 --> 17:28.120
the West in favor of CCP, which we are not majority of the world, including majority

17:28.120 --> 17:35.480
of the Chinese people are not in favor of the CCP. But at the same time, if United States

17:35.480 --> 17:44.040
is so divided that you elect anybody in November 3rd or November 4th, and half the country

17:44.040 --> 17:47.600
will be like, it's not my president. I'm just not going to listen to this person. I don't

17:47.600 --> 17:52.100
care who he is. I'm not going to follow it. And we see the traces of it right now that

17:52.100 --> 17:56.800
some states are saying, we don't care if you're going to send send federal troops. We're not

17:56.800 --> 18:03.680
going to we don't want them. You know, Portland is saying it right now. Pennsylvania, I'm

18:03.680 --> 18:08.600
sorry, Philadelphia said it yesterday, New York is saying it there you you bring federal

18:08.600 --> 18:13.360
troops, we might end up arresting the federal troops. And that is exactly what will lead

18:13.360 --> 18:21.880
to civil war quite possibly. And the gap that will that will be created as a result of this

18:21.880 --> 18:28.400
will be perfect for anybody to step in, you know, it could be partially CCP, it could

18:28.400 --> 18:33.040
be partially Hezbollah and Iran, could be partially Muslim Brotherhood, and it could

18:33.040 --> 18:38.280
be partially countless number of militias that already exist in United States and take

18:38.280 --> 18:43.760
over this country. And basically, it's the end of United States as a union.

18:43.760 --> 18:53.800
So going back to Portland, are there already federal agencies in Portland? Yeah, like who

18:53.800 --> 18:58.800
who who are the ones that are in unmarked uniforms, picking off protesters and throwing

18:58.800 --> 19:05.320
them in unmarked? So actually, that is that is fake news. They are not unmarked uniforms.

19:05.320 --> 19:08.840
What they don't have is their names. They don't have name tags because they've been

19:08.840 --> 19:14.680
doxxed before. And that is that is the game that is being played that Oh, look, they're

19:14.680 --> 19:19.360
not then they're not identifying themselves. But they're not identifying themselves because

19:19.360 --> 19:25.080
they've been doxxed. Okay, but are they feds? Their homeland, their homeland security and

19:25.080 --> 19:30.920
their feds defending the federal courthouse that these people have been trying to set

19:30.920 --> 19:38.800
on fire for days now. All right. I don't know if you saw the footage of some of these I

19:38.800 --> 19:45.840
don't call them protesters. They're not even rioters. These are, I guess, insurgents revolutionaries,

19:45.840 --> 19:50.120
because there's no point of discussion. There is no point of argument. The point of the

19:50.120 --> 19:54.000
revolution for them is the revolution. They want to topple the system. That's that's

19:54.000 --> 19:59.760
what they want. And let me actually share this link with you. Because I think this is

19:59.760 --> 20:05.440
interesting that we're talking about it right now. That this I think Portland is very interesting

20:05.440 --> 20:12.560
because this is how it could start. This could be if that spreads to other cities. Yeah,

20:12.560 --> 20:19.280
absolutely. Absolutely topple the US. So this gentleman, he's president of Portland Police

20:19.280 --> 20:25.680
Union, who's been targeted by in protests, and he said that the community has had enough

20:25.680 --> 20:32.080
now he looks like a black American, but we don't know because if he is going to vote

20:32.080 --> 20:36.160
for Joe Biden, then he will be considered black. If he's not voting for Biden, then

20:36.160 --> 20:43.560
he ain't black. According to Biden, of course, we know that. But he said the elected officials,

20:43.560 --> 20:49.040
the elected officials meaning the mayor and anybody who's allowing this insanity to go

20:49.040 --> 20:55.520
on I believe today is the 55th day that this mess has been going on. He said that the elected

20:55.520 --> 21:01.880
officials have condoned the destruction and chaos at Turner, they have placed a political

21:01.880 --> 21:07.580
agenda ahead, ahead of safety and welfare of the community. This must stop. He's also

21:07.580 --> 21:13.240
said that this is no longer about George Floyd, racial equality, racial equity, social justice

21:13.240 --> 21:20.440
reform, or the evolution of policing. Turner said this is about violence, rioting and destruction.

21:20.440 --> 21:26.880
Our city is under siege by rioters. And I think that's absolutely spot on. You know,

21:26.880 --> 21:35.360
and this is the head of the police union in Portland. So people who are watching what's

21:35.360 --> 21:39.880
going on and there are a lot of them because there is nothing else to do right now in United

21:39.880 --> 21:45.560
States other than watching stuff. You can go out, there is a curfew in a lot of places

21:45.560 --> 21:54.880
including Florida. They are watching this insanity and people don't want that. People

21:54.880 --> 21:59.640
don't want their cities and their neighborhoods to be burned to the ground because of racism

21:59.640 --> 22:04.360
or whatever it is. You know, but this is, this is a narrative that is going nowhere

22:04.360 --> 22:10.480
because they have redefined racism altogether. That any kind of a system that leads to this

22:10.480 --> 22:18.600
kind of an inequality, according to them, is nonsensical, you know, by design. All it

22:18.600 --> 22:24.320
has to be toppled altogether. It has to be destroyed and something else come in the place

22:24.320 --> 22:30.400
of it. So I totally agree with Fritz that there is no civil way to get out of this.

22:30.400 --> 22:34.840
And I don't know, but what I do know is that absolute majority of people are not in favor

22:34.840 --> 22:44.120
of it. Well, how many people are actually actively

22:44.120 --> 22:51.960
part of this rioting? And I think that's probably the correct word because it ain't protesting.

22:51.960 --> 22:55.840
No. Like what? I can never find what kind of numbers

22:55.840 --> 23:02.560
because when I think back in the 60s or when all the riots were going on, you know, half

23:02.560 --> 23:08.600
of LA gets burnt to the ground or a large, several city blocks get burnt to the ground.

23:08.600 --> 23:15.520
Students get gunned down, you know, university campuses. You had a sense of numbers and people

23:15.520 --> 23:20.760
and the protests. I mean, when, when you look at the marches, the million man marches on

23:20.760 --> 23:29.400
Washington and the civil rights movement, it was very real. But what I see now is like

23:29.400 --> 23:35.160
something out of a video game where you're getting this very narrow myopic view of what's

23:35.160 --> 23:43.000
going on. And do we have any handle on how many people are actually destroying everything

23:43.000 --> 23:48.760
for everyone else? And how much of this is? And it was initially the media was just driving

23:48.760 --> 23:53.160
this. And then I think at some point, the mainstream media clue it into the fact that

23:53.160 --> 23:57.940
this was helping Trump. So now they've backed way off and you don't see a lot of this stuff.

23:57.940 --> 24:04.760
Not all of them though, they're, they're capitalizing a lot on this fact that people

24:04.760 --> 24:11.680
coming in unidentified cars and just snatching people off the street. Nancy Pelosi called

24:11.680 --> 24:19.200
them Trump stormtroopers. Right. But that's the back end, right? They never show the Apple

24:19.200 --> 24:25.400
store day before yesterday when the rioters were there, the actual riot, the stuff that,

24:25.400 --> 24:33.560
you know, that would drum up anti rioter, that stuff's not so there always, there's

24:33.560 --> 24:38.560
always this backhanded stuff that's in the media now. If they can spin it as an anti

24:38.560 --> 24:45.200
Trump thing, then it makes the news. But actually, you know, showing what's actually going on

24:45.200 --> 24:50.260
the day to day because there's a lot of looting and rioting still underway. And I don't see

24:50.260 --> 24:59.160
that in the media as Yeah. Yeah, I don't know about the exact numbers. But I do know that

24:59.160 --> 25:03.720
a lot of people within the Democratic Party, and this is one of the reasons that I am not

25:03.720 --> 25:10.520
as terrified as I was maybe two months ago, with respect to the prospect of Democrats

25:10.520 --> 25:16.400
winning in November, because the moment they win, their own civil war will continue because

25:16.400 --> 25:22.960
this is not an ideologically unified group of people. Yeah. This is again, a tent that

25:22.960 --> 25:32.640
has been set up around the animosity against Donald Trump. That's what it is. And GOP has

25:32.640 --> 25:38.080
the same problem too, within the conservatives. Now we see that we have started to see a little

25:38.080 --> 25:44.280
traces of it, that a unity that exists within the GOP and conservatives and evangelicals

25:44.280 --> 25:49.540
and you know, it's a big tent on the other side too. It is around the support of Trump.

25:49.540 --> 25:56.220
It's all about Trump. So good and bad and right and wrong and all of this is being defined

25:56.220 --> 26:01.280
on the basis of whether or not you support or oppose Trump. But I think they're playing

26:01.280 --> 26:07.880
an insane kind of a game. And I don't know when they're going to wake up because CNN

26:07.880 --> 26:16.400
and CNN's office in Georgia was firebombed. And they couldn't believe it. Some leftist

26:16.400 --> 26:26.480
publications offices were firebombed. The far left mayor of Portland House is a target

26:26.480 --> 26:32.200
of the attack of the rioters. And this is the guy who has ordered the police in Portland

26:32.200 --> 26:35.880
just to stay put, don't do anything, let them do whatever they want to do.

26:35.880 --> 26:45.760
Well, it was interesting. I watched that video on Sunday on the grooming gangs in the UK.

26:45.760 --> 26:53.160
What happened in the last 10 years in the UK is what we're seeing here now, where the

26:53.160 --> 27:00.280
political correctness is now impacting law enforcement, it's impacting the judicial system,

27:00.280 --> 27:09.000
it's impacting the behavior of our elected people. And not in a good way. So it's about

27:09.000 --> 27:14.200
right. I've always noted that we're five to 10 years behind Europe in our social behavior.

27:14.200 --> 27:19.080
And so this was last 10 years, this has been unraveling in the UK. And now we're seeing

27:19.080 --> 27:26.240
it here. Because when you look back over the last 10 years, the riots in London, the stuff

27:26.240 --> 27:30.260
that was going on in the UK in terms of people beating each other up and the police just

27:30.260 --> 27:39.280
stepping back, is what's happening here now. So it's, it's, yeah.

27:39.280 --> 27:43.160
It's the same playbook. They're saying it very clearly. I don't know if you know this

27:43.160 --> 27:52.200
woman Linda Sarsour, who is Linda Sarsour is a pawn of Muslim Brotherhood in United

27:52.200 --> 27:59.560
States. She's not even hiding it. She's a hardcore, Marxist Muslim Islamist, who is

27:59.560 --> 28:03.800
not in favor of two state solution. She's in favor of one state solution. And that one

28:03.800 --> 28:10.680
state is Palestine. And she was one of the organizers of women's march that all of these

28:10.680 --> 28:17.960
American women went with their pussy hats. Some of them wore US flag as a headscarves

28:17.960 --> 28:22.760
that people like me coming from that part of the world will be like, are you out of

28:22.760 --> 28:27.840
your freaking mind? What are you doing? Don't you see the big picture here? But it's the

28:27.840 --> 28:35.840
same playbook. And they've said it repeatedly that we're the people who started spring Arab,

28:35.840 --> 28:41.540
the Arab Spring in the Middle East and Northern Africa some 10 years ago, why can't we doing

28:41.540 --> 28:46.680
it right here in United States? They're doing the same thing. The problem with United States

28:46.680 --> 28:52.000
with all of this going on is that every single one of these actions are unconstitutional.

28:52.000 --> 28:58.120
And people are losing their minds because a lot of the lawmakers and I'm talking about

28:58.120 --> 29:04.380
Republicans who supposed to be standing up for constitutional rights of American citizens.

29:04.380 --> 29:10.800
They're also sitting back very quietly, absolute majority of them, which reminded me of the

29:10.800 --> 29:18.360
Conservative Party in Canada, that instead of standing up for your principles and values,

29:18.360 --> 29:27.200
the solid ground that has basically preserved your validity to exist within this dynamic,

29:27.200 --> 29:34.120
they're giving it up all for the sake of public opinion, mob opinion, basically.

29:34.120 --> 29:40.000
Well, the ability to do to do to dox people and destroy them on on, you know, it's, it's

29:40.000 --> 29:46.960
unbelievable. Yeah, I just my summer, my summer reading was Don't Burn This Book and The Madness

29:46.960 --> 29:52.240
of Crowds. And so I plowed through those, which was more books than I normally read

29:52.240 --> 29:58.480
in a lifetime. But they were they're great bookends, those two books. And they and they

29:58.480 --> 30:04.760
they have very different information, but very similar sensibilities and where they're

30:04.760 --> 30:12.120
coming from. And I mean, Douglas Murray just he recants the story of 1990s, where he went

30:12.120 --> 30:16.800
when he was doing research for a university paper, and he went into London to the communist

30:16.800 --> 30:22.440
party headquarters and was invited and talked to the people and being gay, he was potentially

30:22.440 --> 30:27.600
part of the solution. And they said in no uncertain terms in these meetings to when

30:27.600 --> 30:34.720
Doug was there, Douglas Murray that we've lost the working class in England. The working

30:34.720 --> 30:40.520
class don't support us anymore. Right. The working class have it too good. So we have

30:40.520 --> 30:45.200
to weaponize new people and we're now targeting the women's the feminist movement, the gay

30:45.200 --> 30:50.480
community, the trans community, we're targeting these people, and we're going to weaponize

30:50.480 --> 30:58.920
them to promote our cause. And it's come to pass. It's just so sobering to hear that,

30:58.920 --> 31:04.880
you know, emphatically documented. And then at the time, I would have shaken my head that's

31:04.880 --> 31:10.560
not possible in our system. Our democracy is way too strong. But maybe that's one of

31:10.560 --> 31:19.000
the weaknesses of democracy. That because everyone's individual rights are so important,

31:19.000 --> 31:26.760
that leaves us vulnerable to divide and conquer. But I still keep thinking that the majority

31:26.760 --> 31:33.800
of the people in the United States, the majority of people in Canada, don't support what's

31:33.800 --> 31:34.800
going on.

31:34.800 --> 31:35.800
No, they don't.

31:35.800 --> 31:42.600
That's the most surprising thing about the left is they've lost the working class. The

31:42.600 --> 31:48.760
left is divorced from the working class. Has that ever happened before in the history of

31:48.760 --> 31:50.560
leftist politics?

31:50.560 --> 31:56.240
But the answer is in that, isn't it? I mean, the solution is that should be so obvious

31:56.240 --> 32:03.360
to the political people is right there. And yet they're playing into this small group

32:03.360 --> 32:05.660
of people that are driving the narrative.

32:05.660 --> 32:16.600
But I mean, even this coalition that you mentioned, women, LGBTQ, trans, even that is not a solid

32:16.600 --> 32:17.600
kind of a coalition.

32:17.600 --> 32:22.640
No, and Murray goes, that's what his book's about. He's showing how all these are fragmented

32:22.640 --> 32:23.880
and fighting each other.

32:23.880 --> 32:30.200
Yeah. The letter that just came out, it was signed by a whole bunch of people.

32:30.200 --> 32:31.200
Harvard.

32:31.200 --> 32:37.160
Indians cancel culture. But JK Rowling has been hammering on this trans issue for quite

32:37.160 --> 32:45.680
some time because this is very obvious that for the sake of ideology, you want to erase

32:45.680 --> 32:52.880
so much rights that women over many, many decades have fought for to gain.

32:52.880 --> 32:57.380
Basically overnight, you expect them to give it up for the sake of an ideology with some

32:57.380 --> 33:02.540
kind of a completely incoherent, obscure kind of an outcome. You don't know what you're

33:02.540 --> 33:07.960
going for. You know what you're running away from, but you have no idea what you're running

33:07.960 --> 33:08.960
towards.

33:08.960 --> 33:15.600
I like Douglas Murray's analogy of, you know, we've all been on this train, we've all hashed

33:15.600 --> 33:21.280
this stuff out and we've been streaming along and finally we're pulling into the station

33:21.280 --> 33:28.040
and we can all get off this ideological train and work on the solutions we've come up with.

33:28.040 --> 33:32.800
But instead of stopping the train, it's now full steam ahead into oblivion and no one's

33:32.800 --> 33:38.040
had a chance to get off and benefit from all the things. I mean, when you look at what's

33:38.040 --> 33:44.200
happened in all the various aspects of our culture, the level of openness and inclusion

33:44.200 --> 33:51.240
is phenomenal. It's never been this great. And yet everyone wants to dismantle it now.

33:51.240 --> 33:56.920
It's bizarre. And I agree with you that with no rhyme or reason, it's just destroyed for

33:56.920 --> 34:07.360
destroying sake. You look back at, you know, I look back at the Russian Revolution and

34:07.360 --> 34:13.920
the turn of the century and what was going on in the Soviet Union. And I mean, by God,

34:13.920 --> 34:24.920
those people had a reason to be rioting. And then with that same logic and the same narrative,

34:24.920 --> 34:32.880
we're now trying to destroy one of the best civilizations we've ever created. I mean,

34:32.880 --> 34:41.240
what happens if all the protesters lost their iPhones? They were turned off. But no one's

34:41.240 --> 34:47.120
even suggesting a simple solution like that. Just throw a dampening field on the downtown

34:47.120 --> 34:52.600
area that they've, you know, they're occupied. Just put a dampening field on it and no phone

34:52.600 --> 34:58.080
reception anymore. And see how long this, you know, they don't have to bring troops

34:58.080 --> 35:02.720
in and start, you know, beating people up. Just use the technology against them.

35:02.720 --> 35:11.560
You know, they're bringing troops because local law enforcement are refusing to, because

35:11.560 --> 35:17.800
of the orders given to them by politicians to keep this nonsense under control.

35:17.800 --> 35:24.280
Now is this, is this all, is this a democratic plan to discredit Trump?

35:24.280 --> 35:26.920
Yes, absolutely. That's the narrative.

35:26.920 --> 35:33.080
Because the cities that you're looking at who had riots, I believe 25 of them, 25 out

35:33.080 --> 35:41.520
of 26, they're Democrat run and progressive Democrat run. And you look at their district

35:41.520 --> 35:47.800
attorneys, a lot of people within their law enforcement and justice system. And when you

35:47.800 --> 35:54.400
go back to who supported their campaigns, many of them, you get to George Soros. This

35:54.400 --> 36:02.440
is insane because it's a very clear kind of a plan. It's a very clear kind of an approach.

36:02.440 --> 36:08.240
They did it with climate. They did it in colleges and universities. And a lot of people raised

36:08.240 --> 36:13.680
red flags and alarm about it. Nobody cared about unlike a bunch of kids just, you know,

36:13.680 --> 36:19.720
it's not that important. Well, those kids who were yelling in colleges and universities

36:19.720 --> 36:24.840
and shutting down and silencing speakers who disagree with them. Now they're controlling

36:24.840 --> 36:31.120
certain corporations and offices and taking over different kind of positions that are

36:31.120 --> 36:39.400
very, very effective. But it's also the media and big tech that all together, because these

36:39.400 --> 36:43.500
are not their headquarters in America, but they're not American companies. These are

36:43.500 --> 36:52.200
multinational companies owned by shareholders who are benefiting a lot from globalism. And

36:52.200 --> 36:56.440
there is no reason for them to supporting Trump. Otherwise, if you want to think about

36:56.440 --> 37:02.160
it, what Trump is proposing is far more in favor of the working class than the other

37:02.160 --> 37:07.620
way around. Because the other way around is the reason that all of these jobs and manufacturing

37:07.620 --> 37:12.240
plans have been sent to China to begin with. And these are the people that are looting

37:12.240 --> 37:17.520
and destroying small businesses and making the argument that no, you have to keep your

37:17.520 --> 37:23.520
business shut down. We don't want you to recover. Because if you recover and economy does well,

37:23.520 --> 37:26.680
it's not going to be in favor of us. It's going to be in favor of Trump.

37:26.680 --> 37:32.320
Well, so they're trying to recreate the impoverished class nationally.

37:32.320 --> 37:37.280
I don't think they know what they're trying to do. They're trying to defeat Trump. That's

37:37.280 --> 37:41.800
a thing. Everything is about Trump. They want to defeat Trump. And it shows to me how

37:41.800 --> 37:48.440
desperate they are, that they're willing to go to this length, just to remove this

37:48.440 --> 37:54.760
person because it's a very, very effective person. If you want to see things get even

37:54.760 --> 38:00.600
crazier than they're going to get naturally for the rest of the year, just wait until

38:00.600 --> 38:06.000
Trump perhaps get the third pick of the Supreme Court. If something happens to Ruth Bader

38:06.000 --> 38:11.440
Ginsburg, who is now again dealing with cancer. Can you imagine that in the middle of all

38:11.440 --> 38:18.960
of this? Because hey, we are entering a hurricane season. We already entered hurricane season,

38:18.960 --> 38:25.320
but hurricanes usually hit the parts of United States that usually get hit by hurricanes,

38:25.320 --> 38:31.160
including Florida around September, which is right before the election.

38:31.160 --> 38:36.560
But even if she died tomorrow, there's no chance of confirming another Supreme Court

38:36.560 --> 38:38.240
justice before the election.

38:38.240 --> 38:44.440
Mitch McConnell said he would do it. Interesting. Yeah. Mitch McConnell last year said if there

38:44.440 --> 38:50.680
is a vacancy, because I don't know if you remember, but he did not allow Obama to fill

38:50.680 --> 38:59.560
the Supreme Court vacancy because he was the electioneer in 2016, which was probably the

38:59.560 --> 39:08.560
most effective thing he's done ever in his entire life. Yeah. And he said it last year,

39:08.560 --> 39:11.240
they asked him a question, are you going to do it? He said, absolutely, they're going

39:11.240 --> 39:18.360
to do it. And they can do it because they have majority in the Senate.

39:18.360 --> 39:20.360
Is that all they need?

39:20.360 --> 39:21.360
Yep.

39:21.360 --> 39:22.840
Just passionately, sorry, go ahead.

39:22.840 --> 39:27.960
No, no, no. I was just going to mention that they can do it because of the rule that Democrats

39:27.960 --> 39:34.040
put in place that you don't need 60. Basically, they got rid of the nuclear, they got rid

39:34.040 --> 39:40.600
of they call something. They went in favor of something called nuclear option that you

39:40.600 --> 39:47.400
don't need 60 votes, you only need 51 votes to pass to pass the judicial appointments

39:47.400 --> 39:55.320
for Obama because the Republican led Senate wasn't going along with them. And you know,

39:55.320 --> 40:02.240
when when I'm sorry, Democrats, Republicans were not going along with them. So they lowered

40:02.240 --> 40:07.080
the requirement to 51 instead of 60 people in the Senate, so they can just pass, pass

40:07.080 --> 40:12.720
the judicial nominees. And when Republicans got a hold of Senate, they lowered that standard

40:12.720 --> 40:18.600
for Supreme Court nominees as well. So they only need 51. That's that's how they pass

40:18.600 --> 40:25.080
Gursuch. That's how they pass Kavanaugh. And that's how they will be able to pass.

40:25.080 --> 40:29.920
It's going to be a woman, Amy, Amy Coney Barrett, I think is the next in line who's going to

40:29.920 --> 40:33.800
replace whoever is going to be the vacancy in the Supreme Court.

40:33.800 --> 40:42.040
But you know, when I watch Robert Barnes on talk shows, the American civil rights lawyer,

40:42.040 --> 40:46.920
he talks about he doesn't understand what the Democrats or anyone that side of the house

40:46.920 --> 40:52.760
is talking about because the judges have been, you know, have been really good decisions

40:52.760 --> 40:57.680
that the judges that Trump's put in place, and they aren't nearly as partisan as everyone

40:57.680 --> 41:07.680
says they are. No, they're not. So if less partisan, I mean, so that's really interesting.

41:07.680 --> 41:13.260
That sort of contrast. Well, I mean, when they were protesting outside of the Supreme

41:13.260 --> 41:18.920
Court when Kavanaugh name was announced as the nominee, they already had everything ready

41:18.920 --> 41:26.080
with just the name spot being blank. So we're against blank. I'll just fill it in. Brett

41:26.080 --> 41:32.440
Kavanaugh. They even sent a bunch of letters to some places with X instead of a name. They

41:32.440 --> 41:39.520
just forgot to remove it because it has nothing to do with logic, reason, rationality. It

41:39.520 --> 41:43.640
has everything to do with partisanship and tribalism.

41:43.640 --> 41:53.760
But like, it just seems we're talking about all the ideologies and all that. But at a

41:53.760 --> 42:00.760
grassroots level, you got to put food on the table, you got to have a job, you got to get

42:00.760 --> 42:09.340
stuff done. If anything, the virus has shown us that we have to get on top of what we produce

42:09.340 --> 42:14.440
locally on essential stuff. I mean, certainly, there's no reason we can't produce all the

42:14.440 --> 42:26.080
PPE equipment that we need locally. And that would be a narrative, just get her done, do

42:26.080 --> 42:31.280
it locally, build stuff, make stuff, get people working together, look at what industries

42:31.280 --> 42:36.440
or community can set up that works on a community level. All that's, that would all be such

42:36.440 --> 42:43.120
a positive way to approach this. Small business base, small business base, but I don't see

42:43.120 --> 42:49.240
anyone talking in those terms. But to be fair, the one person who, of all the people that

42:49.240 --> 42:54.960
you'd least expect, has been Doug Ford, our Premier in Ontario, has actually been speaking

42:54.960 --> 43:03.200
that and doing it. But I'm missing that in the US. I see it happening at some levels,

43:03.200 --> 43:06.160
and it may be happening, you just don't hear about it. I don't know.

43:06.160 --> 43:11.960
Well, they cannot talk about it because it is the people who are involved within the

43:11.960 --> 43:18.320
establishment right now who are responsible for sending all the jobs basically to China,

43:18.320 --> 43:24.480
for making United States dependent. 95 plus percent of antibiotics in United States is

43:24.480 --> 43:34.000
coming from China. Right? So the situation is insane. And because these people are benefactors

43:34.000 --> 43:42.120
and beneficiaries basically of this entire globalism that hey, we want slave market without

43:42.120 --> 43:50.320
any kind of a regulation so we can produce cheap and sell for much, much more.

43:50.320 --> 43:59.640
But I'm still, I mean, I hear that, and I don't argue against it. But the long game

43:59.640 --> 44:07.000
would leave North America without a revenue stream for most people to buy the products.

44:07.000 --> 44:13.920
So then what? It seems, it almost, I mean, you mentioned the name earlier, but it almost

44:13.920 --> 44:19.040
looks like someone who's shorting the US economy and a bunch of people are shorting it, which

44:19.040 --> 44:24.720
you know that there's been a history of people wanting to do that. I happen to follow what

44:24.720 --> 44:32.600
went on with Elon Musk and Tesla, and the billions of dollars that have been put in

44:32.600 --> 44:38.200
shorting Tesla, and they've lost, I mean, consistently lost every year now for the last

44:38.200 --> 44:45.040
10 years, and they've tried really, really hard to slag, put them down, and they still

44:45.040 --> 44:50.920
can't create a situation where their short puts make any money. They've lost millions

44:50.920 --> 44:57.320
of dollars. So there's all this stuff going on behind the scenes that are, that make a

44:57.320 --> 44:58.320
difference.

44:58.320 --> 45:02.600
Hey, people notice. People notice. Let me share with you something they actually shared

45:02.600 --> 45:08.680
with you guys yesterday. This is really, really interesting. And this is by Eric Weinstein.

45:08.680 --> 45:15.240
This is not a right-wing insane person. Let's see if I can't find it here.

45:15.240 --> 45:17.240
It's who you ask.

45:17.240 --> 45:24.360
Yeah, yeah, exactly. Exactly. You're right. You're right. Let me, let me see if I can

45:24.360 --> 45:25.360
find it.

45:25.360 --> 45:27.360
I'm a big fan of the portal.

45:27.360 --> 45:28.360
Yeah.

45:28.360 --> 45:29.360
Yeah.

45:29.360 --> 45:30.360
Very interesting perspective.

45:30.360 --> 45:33.600
Well, it's his walking rant on racism.

45:33.600 --> 45:34.600
Right.

45:34.600 --> 45:37.200
That was brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

45:37.200 --> 45:38.200
He's spot on.

45:38.200 --> 45:45.160
That should have been mandatory viewing everywhere. And I don't know how much traction it got.

45:45.160 --> 45:48.520
But I certainly passed it around to everyone. And everyone that I passed it to was blown

45:48.520 --> 45:49.520
away.

45:49.520 --> 45:52.000
Well, I can't share it with you guys, but I'm just going to read it to you. I shared

45:52.000 --> 45:57.200
it with you the link yesterday on Facebook, but I'm just going to read it. He tweeted,

45:57.200 --> 46:03.200
this is July 20th, I guess like a day, two days ago, that a surprising number of left-leaning

46:03.200 --> 46:09.440
people are confiding to me that they are planning to vote for Trump for two different stated

46:09.440 --> 46:16.200
leading reasons. A, Biden's mental decline. B, what is happening in the Pacific Northwest

46:16.200 --> 46:23.600
with Democratic mayors, governors experimenting with non policing. And this is something that

46:23.600 --> 46:29.840
I want to go even beyond that because people are seeing what we were talking about in the

46:29.840 --> 46:35.160
beginning that this is about, Hey, whether your country, United States is good or it's

46:35.160 --> 46:44.280
bad inherently. Now either it in either direction, you will have traces of the opposite and the

46:44.280 --> 46:48.760
contrast. Like if it's bad, there are obviously some good, good about it. If it's good, there

46:48.760 --> 46:54.920
are some bad about it. But the idea that you want to get rid of the entire system, you

46:54.920 --> 47:00.460
want to burn down everything and you expect people to pay for it along the way because

47:00.460 --> 47:08.360
they're raising taxes. I just don't understand who can go along with it. But then the question

47:08.360 --> 47:17.520
is how many people are aware of what is exactly going on? Because the Biden campaign are playing

47:17.520 --> 47:23.480
it very, very smartly. Ben Shapiro today on Joe Rogan, he was talking about, there is

47:23.480 --> 47:28.880
no way that you can be afraid of Biden because he's not even alive. How can you be afraid

47:28.880 --> 47:39.880
of the corpse? I know the first reason that Einstein said that the leftists were confiding

47:39.880 --> 47:45.840
in him that is due to Biden's mental state. Does that make any sense to you? Because if

47:45.840 --> 47:50.680
that is the case, let's just take that as a given. Wouldn't that just mean power shifts

47:50.680 --> 47:57.540
to the VP, whoever that is? Absolutely. Well, that's why Biden is once in a lifetime opportunity

47:57.540 --> 48:04.840
for the extremists on that camp, that whoever is going to be the VP, Biden is basically

48:04.840 --> 48:10.160
a placeholder. He's not going to be in charge because keep in mind, Biden is 78 and this

48:10.160 --> 48:16.120
is as good as he gets right now. It's just going to get worse. And they're very aware

48:16.120 --> 48:22.560
of it. And it's really insane that some people are more than willing to throw the entire

48:22.560 --> 48:29.280
country under the bus, knowing this guy who you would not put in charge of taking care

48:29.280 --> 48:39.620
of your kids by himself, like babysit your kid by himself. He's lost. It's a shell of

48:39.620 --> 48:45.120
a human being. Unbelievable. I'm going to call it right now. Biden is going to pick

48:45.120 --> 48:54.440
AOC as his VP because that would guarantee a win. I don't think he can do it because

48:54.440 --> 49:01.240
AOC is not the age requirement of becoming the president. And she's just on the backside

49:01.240 --> 49:06.200
of plastic surgery. She's just coming. No, she is. She's just really got plastic surgery.

49:06.200 --> 49:13.080
Yeah, she had a plastic surgery according to she's getting ready for the campaign trail

49:13.080 --> 49:18.160
because she has sort of her resting face is a bit of a frown. So the guess is that's

49:18.160 --> 49:22.480
what she had corrected. But that was on Scott Adams the other day. He was talking about

49:22.480 --> 49:30.700
that. But she already is set to become the environmental advisor to the White House.

49:30.700 --> 49:35.080
He already talked about it. AOC is going to be in charge of the environment, which means

49:35.080 --> 49:44.520
no oil jobs, no gas jobs, no coil, no coal. He already said that Beto O'Rourke is going

49:44.520 --> 49:47.960
to be in charge of guns. And Beto O'Rourke is a person who said, of course we're going

49:47.960 --> 49:53.400
to take away your AR-15 and AK-47s. What kind of question is that? Of course we're going

49:53.400 --> 49:59.380
to do it. And he's from Texas. And probably Elizabeth Warren is going to be in charge

49:59.380 --> 50:08.920
of treasury. It's a disaster. It's a disaster for absolute majority of American people and

50:08.920 --> 50:14.880
the Western civilization if the guy is elected. But the reason I said I'm not as terrified

50:14.880 --> 50:21.920
as I was two months ago, I'm still very terrified about that prospect. But I'm not as terrified

50:21.920 --> 50:26.440
as I was maybe two months ago because I see the inner fighting within them. And they're

50:26.440 --> 50:30.520
shutting down speech. They're shutting down any kind of a debate because they know that

50:30.520 --> 50:34.760
they lose any kind of a debate for this exact same reason that China isn't allowing any

50:34.760 --> 50:49.100
kind of an open discourse. So those are traces of hope, which is the point of this show.

50:49.100 --> 51:02.240
So do you think Trump has a good chance? Of winning? This year, yeah. So there is on NPR,

51:02.240 --> 51:07.920
there is a money tracker of how much Trump and Biden have raised in the 2020 election.

51:07.920 --> 51:13.440
Let me try one more time and see if I can share it with you guys. This zoom is not exactly

51:13.440 --> 51:18.080
my friend probably because of the Chinese Communist Party, but we don't know. They're

51:18.080 --> 51:25.440
listening. They're listening. There we go. So money tracker, how much Trump and Biden

51:25.440 --> 51:30.300
have raised in 2020 election. Now, I don't know if you guys have heard from the media

51:30.300 --> 51:38.760
that Biden has been consistently for the past two months over raising compared to Trump,

51:38.760 --> 51:43.680
which is complete nonsense. Because if you come down, you see it's only one of Biden's

51:43.680 --> 51:52.280
PACs called Biden Victory Fund that's been out raising Trump. But the rest, and Trump

51:52.280 --> 51:59.240
had had a head start, obviously, Trump has raised far more money than Biden. But what's

51:59.240 --> 52:08.040
really, really interesting is based on counties. Look at this map. This is from 2019, people

52:08.040 --> 52:16.520
who have given money to Trump campaign and Biden campaign. And you see on Trump, Los

52:16.520 --> 52:26.240
Angeles County is number one in giving Trump money. More than it's given to Biden. Los

52:26.240 --> 52:29.840
Angeles County, you would imagine that Los Angeles is one of those places that you would

52:29.840 --> 52:37.920
imagine, oh, they're like solid blue. They're all in favor of Democrats. But no, Miami-Dade

52:37.920 --> 52:43.200
is another interesting one with the amount of money that they've given to Trump. Broward

52:43.200 --> 52:52.160
County, which is the county that we're in, one of the infamous counties in Florida, solid

52:52.160 --> 52:56.360
blue, they've given more money to Trump than they give them to Biden. They've given more

52:56.360 --> 53:05.080
than $2 million, almost $2.5 million to Trump, less than $1 million to Biden. So what's the

53:05.080 --> 53:13.520
correlation like between funds and victory? Well, they have, obviously, the ability to

53:13.520 --> 53:19.960
hire people underground. But historically, is there any correlation? I don't know about

53:19.960 --> 53:26.880
that. That would be very interesting to see. At the same time, though, in 2016, Hillary

53:26.880 --> 53:37.040
Clinton raised far more than Trump by a lot, and Trump ended up winning. Trump got far

53:37.040 --> 53:44.120
more free publicity because they didn't take him seriously. So he does not have that advantage

53:44.120 --> 53:52.240
now. He does not have that surprise factor. And now that the CPP have taken over Twitter

53:52.240 --> 53:58.120
and embedded their bots into it when they took it down there last week, God knows what

53:58.120 --> 54:02.480
will happen to all Trump's tweets in the future. Do you think it was the CCP? Because I'm also

54:02.480 --> 54:07.720
hearing that they were patriots within Twitter, because one of the only accounts that was

54:07.720 --> 54:13.240
not touched was Trump's account. Well, that was my initial response, because typically,

54:13.240 --> 54:18.360
you know, 99% of the time it's done from the inside, something like that. No, it was done

54:18.360 --> 54:27.760
on the inside. It was definitely an inside job. Yeah, but they had an insider help them.

54:27.760 --> 54:34.400
Yeah, right. But what I wasn't clear what the outcome of that was. David, you get any

54:34.400 --> 54:43.400
any hint like? No, well, there was the Bitcoin scam. The hackers paid a few hundred thousand

54:43.400 --> 54:49.160
dollars before it was cut off. Apparently, they didn't make it because Coinbase blocked

54:49.160 --> 54:56.440
those transactions. Okay. Yes. They blocked transactions after a point. But once it had

54:56.440 --> 55:04.160
been sent to the address, they cannot get back. That's the nature of Bitcoin. However,

55:04.160 --> 55:09.040
speculation was that this was just a distraction for something more sinister. But I haven't

55:09.040 --> 55:15.120
heard any. That was my brain went right to that, you know, this is, it's too much of

55:15.120 --> 55:19.200
a coincidence that this happened this close to the election. And we know how important

55:19.200 --> 55:26.240
Twitter was to Trump. So I'm wondering if someone's trying to make Twitter less favorable.

55:26.240 --> 55:32.480
Well, I mean, whatever the case is, I think this is very obvious that Twitter at this

55:32.480 --> 55:38.760
point is a matter of national security. Because if you can break into someone's account with

55:38.760 --> 55:44.560
that amount of influence, you can start World War Three. Just imagine somebody in Twitter,

55:44.560 --> 55:50.080
some activists get into Trump's account, like been thinking a lot about it. Xi Jinping is

55:50.080 --> 55:55.600
not going along with my narrative, no longer my friend. I'll talk to him through Rocketman

55:55.600 --> 56:02.380
or something like that. Right? What are you going to do about it? You know, it will be

56:02.380 --> 56:07.840
like a Doctor Strange Love kind of a scenario. Yeah, that hey, that we just have an insane

56:07.840 --> 56:14.640
person we're not actually sending you bombs. We have to retaliate. And YouTube seems to

56:14.640 --> 56:20.800
be going spending going over time now shutting people down with very little explanation.

56:20.800 --> 56:24.640
YouTube is just ridiculous. And I'm saying that as somebody who has a YouTube account

56:24.640 --> 56:31.320
for a couple of years now and creating content, I just look at my subscriber number, it goes

56:31.320 --> 56:39.640
up by like 200 and comes down by 200. And this is like within an hour. And they've deleted

56:39.640 --> 56:43.720
my videos. And I don't have like huge amount of subscribers or followers or anything. I'm

56:43.720 --> 56:52.560
shadow banned. I've been my account was suspended for three months last summer. But they're

56:52.560 --> 56:57.040
doing it very obviously. They don't even care anymore. It's not like they're doing it in

56:57.040 --> 57:01.320
a covert stealth kind of a way. They're just doing the ad. This is what it is, man. You're

57:01.320 --> 57:06.600
not following the narrative. We're not going to favor you. Which Facebook, I'm sorry, Facebook's

57:06.600 --> 57:13.760
doing the same. Yeah. Facebook. I mean, who knows? Who knows? Because Facebook supposedly

57:13.760 --> 57:21.280
is still a little playing on the fence. Hopefully, Peter Thiel sort of, you know, kicks them

57:21.280 --> 57:28.200
every now and then. Well, Peter, Peter Thiel is a very rational human being. His whole

57:28.200 --> 57:36.520
thing is that it's never the worst or the best kind of a scenario. And he's more of

57:36.520 --> 57:41.240
what what's happening right now. And what what can I make out of it? It's really interesting

57:41.240 --> 57:45.160
to listen to him is one of one of the very few people who get a really good idea. He

57:45.160 --> 57:50.040
actually was a person. And maybe seven, eight years ago, they talked about Elon Musk, what

57:50.040 --> 57:53.680
you were talking about, that people are betting against him. I said never bet against Elon

57:53.680 --> 57:59.640
Musk. That's right. No, I was meaning more the fact that he's a major shareholder at

57:59.640 --> 58:05.560
Facebook. Yeah, he's I think he's still on the board as well. Yeah, yeah. So I wonder

58:05.560 --> 58:11.640
if he pokes them every now and then. But I think they need they need to be made into

58:11.640 --> 58:19.880
public utilities, like phones and electricity. But I was reading up on it. Bill Clinton in

58:19.880 --> 58:27.280
the 90s said, Okay, you guys need a break to get rolling. So you're not publishing houses,

58:27.280 --> 58:32.680
you get an exemption. Right. And all that has to be done is that exemption has to be

58:32.680 --> 58:38.120
taken away. No legislation, no change in the rules. Just take the exemption away. And all

58:38.120 --> 58:43.000
of a sudden, you know, YouTube and Facebook and Twitter are all publishing houses responsible

58:43.000 --> 58:48.460
for their content. Isn't that the executive order that Trump signed? He's been trying,

58:48.460 --> 58:55.360
but I haven't seen it roll. I miss that if he has. Yeah, I believe that he signed the

58:55.360 --> 59:05.360
executive order with respect to preserving free speech maybe on on on big tech platforms.

59:05.360 --> 59:10.900
But there is what you're talking about. I can't remember something 35 or something like that.

59:10.900 --> 59:17.000
It's called that yes, they're platforms, they're not publishers, therefore, they're not responsible

59:17.000 --> 59:22.040
for what what's being published. But that was but that's an exemption they got. Yes,

59:22.040 --> 59:28.040
that's the exemption and Facebook ruined their own chance and opportunity of making any kind

59:28.040 --> 59:35.120
of an argument in favor of their exemption by removing the Federalist from Facebook making

59:35.120 --> 59:42.240
the argument that some of the comments put under your post were in violation of our Terms

59:42.240 --> 59:49.880
of Service. And that's what Eric blew everything up that like what are you talking about? Okay,

59:49.880 --> 59:54.120
you know, it's the equivalent of I'm talking on a phone and they just shut me down because

59:54.120 --> 01:00:01.480
we don't like what you're talking about, basically. Right. So here is my solution.

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:10.500
Break him apart, make him into public utility. Put that entire database of big data into

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:19.000
a blockchain database and pay people for their data. Make people in this country shareholders

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:24.280
are what you're creating. Now, the only person who's talking about this is Andrew Yang, with

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:30.360
respect to he's calling it data dividend. When he said that I was so happy because that's

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:36.100
exactly what I was talking about. I would respect the UBI UBI I don't think it should

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:40.800
be tax funded. I don't think it should be an extension of a welfare state, which is

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:47.560
the far left wants to do it progressives want to do it. It should be funded by user data,

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:54.440
it will incentivize you to create more data, data creation will become your job. You're

01:00:54.440 --> 01:01:02.200
making money, you're part of the system. And this entire thing will be will be a public

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:06.760
in public interest rather than being just arm of the media mainstream media because

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:09.520
that's what it is right now.

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:17.040
Okay, yeah, I agree with you. And I think Yang was right on the money with that the

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:25.640
but to make that happen, if they're if they're made publishing houses, or if they're responsible

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:32.400
for their content again, then wouldn't it level the playing field and allow other people

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:37.840
to come up, because then they're big advantage that they don't have to put any energy into

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:42.960
policing their content, you know, except, you know, I suppose they are putting a fair

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:47.640
bit energy into doing that at one level. But if they were truly responsible legally for

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:53.200
the content on their sites, that would change how they could behave and what they could

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:58.160
actually do. And it would let other groups come up. And then the people that offer that

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:03.400
kind of a solution, we're okay, you're on our site, we'll, you know, we'll give you

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:09.240
a say in who's on the site with you will give you a piece of the data that we start collecting

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:14.680
and you become a shareholder in the company that could emerge. I'm always a little bit

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:23.840
skeptical in my old age of legislating or, or requiring that sort of a solution. Like,

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:28.640
I think it has to happen from the grassroots. There are already alternatives, like bit shoot

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:33.080
is an alternative, for example, to YouTube. But it's just a matter of the amount of users

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:38.920
and the amount of amount of data that these users have already created. Hey, think of,

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:46.960
for example, of the man who shall not be named Alex Jones, who was removed overnight. Yeah,

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:51.980
in a very, and I don't even like Alex Jones, I think everybody should be able to say whatever

01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:57.360
they want to say, blah, blah, blah, blah, all of that. But the way that he was removed

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:07.440
in a very coordinated kind of a manner, you are basically destroying someone's livelihood,

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:11.840
because you don't agree with the narrative that is being shared. And that he had millions

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:17.440
and millions and millions of followers, millions and millions and millions of dollars made

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:23.540
for YouTube and Google because of his content. No, we just don't want to go away. But so

01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:28.000
there's two solutions here I'm hearing. I mean, I'm coming from the perspective, let's

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:35.140
roll back, you know, 40 years in time. And if you have stuff up, you're a publisher.

01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:40.020
That would be one and the other solution is what I'm hearing you're saying is, no, no,

01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:49.480
you don't get to moderate or mediate the content, you're a utility. Right. So even you have

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:54.400
to go one of those two ways, but we're in this bizarre middle ground right now, because

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:59.040
of the political interests. I think we can do both of them. You make you make the publisher

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:06.720
argument. And immediately after that, you raise a national security threat argument.

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:14.280
Because that's exactly what it is. Yeah. So you set you set the new starting point for

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:19.640
whoever is coming next. Is it going to be parlor? Is it going to be bit shoot? Is it

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:26.760
going to be whoever? But at the same time, it is a national security threat. Because

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:34.440
this is not going to get any less complicated. And create a creating fake news, quote unquote,

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:41.200
is not going to get any harder. This would almost be a good time to just hope the other

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:51.600
fellow there and say, nationhood, national security, you know, protecting a way of life,

01:04:51.600 --> 01:05:07.080
how does that fit in to a worldview that where we don't have nations? Let's hear it. What

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:17.320
do you mean we don't have nations? Well, if we if we step away in Canada as a nation,

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:24.720
allegedly, some would argue that. But not true, though. There's a thing. Well, yeah,

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:29.720
there are tribal components. Yeah, we're post national. Yeah. But there's tribal components

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:38.080
to our existence. Human existence, there always have been tribal components. And our strength

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:44.520
has been that we can gather together to a whole bunch of tribes and agree on a common

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:54.120
goal. And that sort of left us with nations. And we've, we were starting goal. Pardon me?

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:57.320
Yeah, I don't agree with that. What's our common goal? Well, that's what I'm putting

01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:05.160
on. Well, a common goal would be food production, sharing resources, providing services that

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:09.560
other group can't provide. You don't need that nation to provide food. Food was around

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:15.120
long before nations. But you didn't share it necessarily, or you didn't sell it back

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:23.720
and forth. Yep. People traded food before nations existed. But what's the argument not

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:33.200
to have nations? Like, how do you how do you frame that? At this point, right now? Nations

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:39.960
are a liability. We'd have nuclear wars if there weren't for nations. There would be

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:45.440
trade wars if there weren't for nations. We wouldn't have them. Is it nations or governments?

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:51.800
If you get rid of governments, and you have, let's say, because my argument, I don't think

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:55.640
that you can get rid of governments. And I am not against anything that exists, because

01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:59.800
I think anything that exists exists for a reason, as a consequence of series of events

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:04.520
and the behavior of the system and all of that. But I think, for example, in case of

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:10.240
United States, government should be limited to the military. And I really can't think

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:17.880
of anything else that you just secure the borders. And you guarantee this the security

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:24.680
of of people who are within that structure. And that's the amount of that's the amount

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:29.480
of taxes that you pay to to preserve that kind of a service. And that's about it. And

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:35.960
you leave the rest to whatever whatever kind of an option that can survive the free market

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:36.960
competition.

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:43.340
Okay, what you just described is a protection racket. What is that protection and protection

01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:50.720
racket? Yeah. So that's when organized crime moves in and says that you have to pay for

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:55.680
our protection. Yeah. If you don't if you don't pay, your business will likely catch

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.600
on fire. Shame about that.

01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:03.120
Yeah, I don't think there is any any way around that whatsoever. I think bigger you get bigger

01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:08.720
share you have to pay to deal with bigger, bigger gangs, because your government is the

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:14.600
ultimate mafia. Yeah, exactly. So what's the what's the option? You don't think there's

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:23.360
any way around this? I think there is a way around the ethical arguments that we don't

01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:32.200
need to have everything we can have certain amount of things to provide safety and happiness

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:39.980
and security and health and all of those things. But beyond that, it's it's a matter of greed.

01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:43.800
If you want to go and deal with that, then there are people who are greedier than you

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:50.940
and they have bigger guns and bigger ammos and bigger, you know, more resources to take

01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:59.760
away from you and from everyone else for their own sake. But I go back to 2001 Space Odyssey,

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:06.840
that the moment we have figured out how to use tools and weapons and anything, we use

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:14.240
that first to provide for ourselves. And then second to take it away from the competitor,

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:19.280
whoever that competitor might be, it just the nature of humanity. I don't believe that

01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:29.240
if we don't have certain I just call them safety nets. If we don't have that, we're

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:37.820
just going to behave. I think people are as terrible as they are wonderful. And I think

01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:45.800
if you're not protecting ourselves in different ways, there are people who are just going

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:52.640
to walk all over you because they have, again, bigger guns and more will and more ability

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:55.080
to take over your resources.

01:09:55.080 --> 01:10:04.440
Well, I'm I don't doubt that you need physical protection from bad guys. I never did.

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:12.160
How do you implement that in as an alternative to to a nation as an alternative to a protection

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:21.560
racket? Fair enough. You could do it with a consortium of security forces that are all

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:27.160
either for profit or charities. Isn't that exactly the protection racket in a different

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:39.320
way? No, because they they don't tax you. They don't force you to pay for them. But

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:46.000
you still have to pay. Oh, you would likely pay somebody to protect you just like and

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:56.300
they can be overrun by a stronger force. That's always the case. Well, exactly. Like what

01:10:56.300 --> 01:11:02.120
happened in Seattle? Were you following what happened in Seattle? You do need to have a

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:09.680
stronger force than people that invade you. Yeah, that's that's my whole point. I agree.

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:16.480
I don't think you have to run a protection racket to get that stronger force. So so rather

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:23.080
than have a government and all the huge financial burden that that encompass, you just you have

01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:28.240
private company, you have private security forces and those private security forces are

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:34.320
part of a consortium that makes the rules and all the private companies pay into the

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:41.120
consortium to keep it going. Right. And if any of them breaks the rules, then they get

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:46.400
kicked out of the consortium. Well, who will own the nuclear weapons? Because they exist

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:52.920
right now already. That's what I'm talking about that right now. What are our options?

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:57.520
Because what happened in Seattle with respect to this can't change overnight. No, what would

01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:03.920
you have to probably dismantle the nuclear weapons? Yeah, a period of decades. Exactly.

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:09.480
If not centuries. Yeah, it could be a long time. What happened in Seattle? I was actually

01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:15.640
thinking about you because that's that's something we can talk. I think we we should move towards

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:21.000
wrapping this up. But that is something maybe we can talk next time that we come together.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:29.360
But I was thinking about it because they started they call it Chaz as at first, which was Capitol

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:36.900
Hill Autonomous Zone. Yes, I remember Chaz. The first thing they did, they built a border

01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:43.320
with walls. The second thing they did. Yeah, exactly. The second thing they did, they created

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:50.520
their own police force, beating people down, shooting people, interrogating them. And then

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:59.000
they changed their name to chop, which was Capitol Hill occupying protest, because they

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:04.400
thought of it, hey, if we're autonomous, how are we going to get water? How are we going

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:12.520
to get electricity? So I totally agree with you on the ethical and we had this conversation

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:18.400
before and the ethical sense of a way. But practically, I think it's never it's not going

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:25.160
to happen because of human nature, because we already have massive weapons already that

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:30.740
exists on this planet. And even if people that's one of the reasons I never agreed

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:36.200
with the Iran deal, Iran nuclear deal, I don't care how many paper they're going to sign

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:40.560
that they're going to, they're not going to build a nuclear bomb. If they can't build

01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:49.280
a nuclear bomb, they're going to build a nuclear bomb. And for as long as this, which I think

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:56.120
is an inseparable part of human nature, that you just want to have more and more control

01:13:56.120 --> 01:14:01.480
over resources. And that's why we progress. But at the same time, that that's why we cause

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:08.440
a lot of trouble for each other and pain. Because we, we are hardwired in just gathering

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:12.520
more and more and more and more without really knowing why do we need all of these stuff

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:18.000
and putting everybody and including ourselves into a bigger kind of problems and continuous

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:27.040
kind of problems. I mean, I mean, I genuinely like what David's saying. And I get it. And

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:30.960
I understand what you're saying that how do we get there? Maybe we can establish smaller

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:38.200
communities based on that principles. Or, yeah, sure. That's the way to do it is just

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:45.680
imagine dividing up every state into counties and every county into city states and get

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:53.520
smaller and smaller. Yeah, decentralized as decentralized as it gets. Yeah. And maybe

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:59.520
regions like the West Coast and the East Coast have more in common to function as an entity

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:09.360
than forcing the East West trade that the nation states but my concern and maybe the

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:16.680
solution lies in the fact that you said it a guy that we were totally dependent on government

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:22.840
now it is the ultimate as David says, it's the ultimate racket. I mean, every every aspect

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:28.480
of our life is controlled, we're told, you know, from, you know, you got to do this,

01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:32.280
you got to wear a mask, you're going to have to have a vaccination, you got to do this.

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:36.880
You can't open this, you can't close that. I mean, it's been really clearly shown how

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:46.080
much the government puts on the table that you have to do. So I think, you know, the

01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:53.640
FDA, the environmental agencies, for example, that I mean, no need, the agricultural agencies,

01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:59.000
you know, subsidizing farmers, all that stuff, I think, it can be tossed by the wayside and

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:07.500
then you're left with initially, just military, the justice system. And, and then the policing

01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:14.760
falls back to the lower municipalities. Yeah. And at that point, you move forward, right.

01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:22.280
And I think there is also a deeper layer at the core of governments. And that's, I think,

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:29.000
they're worth discussing that United States government, its sole job is to protect the

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.480
US Constitution. And the rights in the US Constitution are not coming from the man,

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:39.440
it's coming from the God. Now, what kind of a God, who that God is, that's a different

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:44.680
kind of a story. But I think that's the whole point of American exceptionalism, that when

01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:50.400
the First Amendment is providing and guaranteeing your free speech, that is not the right that

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:57.720
is given to you by man, that is your natural right that is recognized by this legal document.

01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:03.900
And the job of the government of United States is to protect that, versus job of the Chinese

01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:09.240
Communist Party government is the man setting all the laws and all the rules and everybody

01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:14.240
else should follow them. And that is exactly going back to what Zizek said, that is a moment

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:20.720
of philosophy that has that is created right now this opportunity for all of us to discuss.
