00:00.000 --> 00:08.160
we need to debate how warfare itself is changing. If the planes that are bombing people have no

00:08.160 --> 00:12.240
pilots in them, and the operators of those planes are sitting safely in the middle of

00:12.240 --> 00:24.640
the United States, it's kind of confusing. Hello, and welcome to the 18th episode of

00:24.640 --> 00:31.040
Neo Human Podcast. I'm Agar Bahari, an ecologist on Twitter and Instagram, and you can follow the

00:31.040 --> 00:38.240
show on LiveInLimbo.com, iTunes, and soon on YouTube. With me today is Hugh Gusterson. Welcome

00:38.240 --> 00:42.560
to the show, Hugh. It's a pleasure to be here. Let's start with some background, some of the

00:42.560 --> 00:49.040
works you've done and what you're working on now these days. Sure. I'm an anthropologist by training

00:49.040 --> 00:52.960
and I teach anthropology and international affairs at George Washington University.

00:52.960 --> 01:01.200
Originally, I was going to do field work in Africa in the 1980s. I was a grad student at the time.

01:01.200 --> 01:07.920
There was a massive nuclear freeze movement against the nuclear arms race. I took an odd

01:07.920 --> 01:12.480
turn in my career and decided to write about the culture of American nuclear weapons designers

01:12.480 --> 01:18.880
instead. Much of my work has been on different aspects of the culture of American militarism.

01:18.880 --> 01:23.680
I've written a couple of books about nuclear weapons designers and anti-nuclear activists.

01:23.680 --> 01:30.080
I've written about counterinsurgency in Iraq and Afghanistan. After this book, I'm finishing up

01:30.080 --> 01:35.040
a third book on what American nuclear weapons scientists do after the end of nuclear testing.

01:35.040 --> 01:40.080
You started as an anti-nuclear activist in the early 80s and went on to

01:41.040 --> 01:44.640
studying the attitudes of nuclear scientists as an anthropologist.

01:44.640 --> 01:49.600
What is the mindset of a nuclear scientist? For the most part, very rational.

01:51.520 --> 01:55.680
Despite the fact that about three quarters of the weapons scientists I interviewed

01:55.680 --> 02:00.880
were active Christians, but they were what you might call sort of moderate secular Christians

02:00.880 --> 02:06.640
for the most part, mainstream denominations like Catholics, Methodists, Presbyterians,

02:06.640 --> 02:15.680
Episcopalians. They had a strong faith that the weapons they designed would never be used. I even

02:15.680 --> 02:20.960
had weapons scientists say to me that they would not feel ethically comfortable working on weapons

02:20.960 --> 02:27.120
like napalm or landmines because those weapons would be used to kill people. They were confident

02:27.120 --> 02:32.320
that their weapons would be used to deter World War III. Some weapons scientists told me that they

02:32.320 --> 02:36.960
felt personally proud. They thought they'd saved millions of lives by making a war between the

02:36.960 --> 02:43.600
Americans and the Soviets impossible. They had this sort of faith that human rationality would

02:43.600 --> 02:50.400
make deterrence work in the final instance, that the weapons would not be used. When I asked them

02:50.400 --> 02:54.960
if they ever had nightmares about nuclear war, they would sort of look cross-eyed at me and say,

02:54.960 --> 03:00.000
well, why would I have a nightmare about nuclear war? That would be irrational. Many of the

03:00.000 --> 03:05.040
anti-nuclear activists I interviewed and knew as friends on the other hand were deeply terrified

03:05.040 --> 03:10.000
that deterrence would break down, there would be an accident, there would be a miscalculation,

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
and millions of people would die. Many of those activists did have nightmares about nuclear war.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.720
In some ways, the division between the activists and the weapons scientists was around emotion

03:22.720 --> 03:29.200
and rationality, with one community strongly confident that the weapons could be relied on

03:29.200 --> 03:34.320
to keep the peace, and the others terrified that there would be a miscalculation. You could say the

03:34.320 --> 03:39.280
weapons scientists were in denial, or you could say the activists were overly emotional. Take your

03:39.280 --> 03:46.160
pick. I was watching a documentary about the state of US nuclear facilities, and they're all using

03:46.160 --> 03:53.680
old computers, big floppy disks, which I would imagine makes it easier to operate based on the

03:53.680 --> 03:58.160
older knowledge, but it makes it harder for hackers to hack into it. What do you think about that

03:58.160 --> 04:05.040
structural, systematic structure that has remained the same throughout all these technological

04:05.040 --> 04:11.040
advancements in the past couple of years? Well, I think you're talking about the technology that's

04:11.040 --> 04:16.400
used at the missile launch control facilities. That's right. I read that article as well. I don't

04:16.400 --> 04:21.680
know if they deliberately failed to upgrade as a safety measure, or if this was an unintended

04:21.680 --> 04:28.960
benefit of being behind the times. Strangely enough, there's a parallel story. The Soviets used to

04:28.960 --> 04:35.440
rely on pre-digital technology with vacuum tubes that were resistant to electromagnetic pulse from

04:35.440 --> 04:41.360
a nuclear explosion. This was just because they didn't have the resources to upgrade, but their

04:41.360 --> 04:47.040
planes would have survived a nuclear war better than American planes, as it turns out. I suspect

04:47.040 --> 04:53.520
this is just an accidental benefit of a failure to keep up with the times, but it is funny that

04:53.520 --> 05:00.400
these ancient three-inch floppy disks could make American nuclear missiles more resistant to

05:00.400 --> 05:05.680
hacking. I should say that at the weapons labs, they do have state-of-the-art facilities there to

05:05.680 --> 05:11.280
do research. They have some of the fastest supercomputers in the world. Their machines are

05:11.280 --> 05:17.840
usually listed somewhere in the top 10 in terms of speed and storage capability.

05:17.840 --> 05:24.400
Because the weapons labs haven't been allowed to test a nuclear weapon since 1992, they largely rely

05:24.400 --> 05:31.920
on extremely powerful supercomputer simulations of nuclear tests to maintain the stockpile. The

05:31.920 --> 05:37.040
United States, as your listeners may or may not know, still has about 7,000 nuclear weapons.

05:37.040 --> 05:42.960
And somehow the weapons labs have to assure that they work. So they have very expensive

05:42.960 --> 05:50.720
state-of-the-art lasers, simulation machines, and supercomputers. So on the design end of things,

05:50.720 --> 05:55.200
they're certainly not behind the times. I'll have more questions about nuclear weapons.

05:55.200 --> 06:00.400
I'll come back to them. But let's talk about your new book. The new book is called Drone Remote

06:00.400 --> 06:04.640
Control Warfare. What's the book about and what inspired you to write it now?

06:04.640 --> 06:11.760
Well, I think the United States has entered into a new form of warfare, drone warfare.

06:12.640 --> 06:18.320
It's on the edge of American consciousness. Everyone in the United States is aware that

06:18.320 --> 06:24.800
this kind of warfare is being practiced. The details are not widely known. The United States

06:24.800 --> 06:30.800
has adopted a policy that it feels free to assassinate people in countries at which it

06:30.800 --> 06:37.040
is not a war, to conduct military operations in countries like Yemen, Pakistan, Somalia,

06:37.840 --> 06:42.160
where it's not a war, even the Philippines. The U.S. has done two drone strikes on the Philippines.

06:43.760 --> 06:48.400
There's been almost no debate about this in Congress. On the very rare occasions where

06:48.400 --> 06:55.200
there's a hearing, almost no congressmen show up. The reporters often just report that a strike

06:55.200 --> 07:01.280
took place. It's a very brief article. So-and-so, according to the Pentagon, was killed, the Taliban

07:01.280 --> 07:07.840
leader, or whatever. I think the fact that the United States is conducting military operations

07:07.840 --> 07:12.240
that have not been approved by Congress, in some cases, it has deliberately killed American

07:12.240 --> 07:18.720
citizens without any kind of judicial process that would legitimate the execution of the death

07:18.720 --> 07:25.600
penalty. We need more debate about that. And I think we need to debate how warfare itself is

07:25.600 --> 07:32.880
changing if the planes that are bombing people have no pilots in them and the operators of those

07:32.880 --> 07:38.080
planes are sitting safely in the middle of the United States. It's kind of confusing. Do those

07:38.080 --> 07:46.080
people deserve medals? Are they people who've been in combat or not? Are they legitimate targets for

07:46.080 --> 07:51.040
the enemy? If the Taliban could somehow get someone to Nevada, would it be okay for them to blow up a

07:51.040 --> 07:55.680
drone operator? Lots of very interesting kinds of questions that need exploration.

07:56.640 --> 08:01.600
It's excellent. I was going to ask you, how does the ability to fight wars remotely affecting the

08:01.600 --> 08:05.920
human side of war? Because we see that a lot of those operators, they're saying that they go to

08:05.920 --> 08:12.400
work at like eight in the morning and they shoot some missile somewhere across the world, and then

08:12.400 --> 08:18.160
they just go back and have dinner with their family in the same city. How does the ability to

08:18.160 --> 08:23.440
not being involved personally in wars affecting the human side of war, whether it's soldiers or

08:23.440 --> 08:28.240
civilians? Well, I think on the receiving end of the strikes, there's a very strong feeling that

08:28.240 --> 08:36.640
this is a very cowardly way of conducting warfare. In some perverse kind of way, I think civilians in

08:36.640 --> 08:42.800
places like Afghanistan and Yemen feel the way about drone strikes that Americans do about suicide

08:42.800 --> 08:51.920
bomber strikes, that it's just not cricket, if you like, to attack people in such a way that you

08:51.920 --> 08:56.880
can't be attacked in reverse. If you're a suicide bomber, you preemptively kill yourself. And if

08:56.880 --> 09:02.240
you're a drone operator, you're just not around to be attacked. So for people on the receiving end,

09:02.240 --> 09:08.400
there's this strong sense that this new form of warfare is cowardly, it's unfair.

09:08.400 --> 09:12.960
And American policymakers can be very puzzled about this. They point out that the drones

09:12.960 --> 09:19.280
are often more discriminating than an F-16 would be, that they kill fewer civilians by accident.

09:19.280 --> 09:23.120
And so they say, we don't understand why the people in these other countries are so angry

09:23.120 --> 09:27.280
about drone strikes that tend to kill fewer civilians. But I think the key to the anger

09:27.280 --> 09:33.200
lies in this perception that it's a form of warfare that's cowardly. As for the operators in the

09:33.200 --> 09:40.400
United States, we're seeing reports of very high levels of stress. Now, some people say it's because

09:40.400 --> 09:46.640
they work very long hours. They work 12-hour shifts, often six days a week. Some people say

09:46.640 --> 09:52.560
it's because the battle zone is not sort of clearly, clearly demarcated. You leave your family,

09:52.560 --> 09:56.480
your wife and kids, or your husband and kids in the morning, you leave your family, your wife and

09:56.480 --> 10:02.400
kids in the morning, drive to this pod, sit in this pod for 12 hours, keeping people under

10:02.400 --> 10:06.560
surveillance and sometimes killing them. And then you drive to pick up the kids from soccer and

10:06.560 --> 10:12.080
have dinner with them. Psychologically, I think that's very disturbing and very jarring. The two

10:12.080 --> 10:17.440
Hollywood depictions we have of drone warfare, the good kill and eye in the sky, both suggest

10:17.440 --> 10:23.040
that it's subjectively quite stressful for the operators. And that's what journalistic accounts

10:23.040 --> 10:29.200
as well, high levels of risk for divorce, alcoholism, and so on. It's an interesting

10:29.200 --> 10:35.840
question why the Pentagon didn't decide to base these drone operators outside the US. They don't

10:35.840 --> 10:40.000
have to put them in the battle zone. They could put them in a military base in Abu Dhabi or in

10:40.000 --> 10:46.400
Turkey or somewhere like that. And I think they might feel subjectively more as if they were at

10:46.400 --> 10:54.240
war than they do by being commuter warriors. What drone strikes are the continuation of the war on

10:54.240 --> 11:00.960
terror that started by or started as September 11. But on the American side, it was waged by

11:00.960 --> 11:08.000
George W. Bush, but then it continued throughout the entire Obama administration. How do you feel

11:08.000 --> 11:13.440
about the increase of remote drone operations during Obama administration? I think it's very

11:13.440 --> 11:20.240
interesting that the president who got elected originally by being so opposed to the war in Iraq,

11:20.240 --> 11:25.920
if not the war in Afghanistan, but by being a strong critic of many aspects of the war on terror

11:25.920 --> 11:31.440
and a critic of Guantanamo, it's interesting that he escalated the use of drone strikes so much.

11:32.160 --> 11:38.160
At one point during his presidency, the US was doing one drone strike every three days in Pakistan,

11:38.160 --> 11:42.480
a country where, I would remind you listeners, the US is not in a declared war. I mean, that's

11:42.480 --> 11:51.360
very, very intense. This is in what year? It was in the middle years, around 2010, 11, 12. He's

11:51.360 --> 11:58.240
backed off of that to some degree now. I think there is something in President Obama's psyche

11:58.240 --> 12:09.040
that is drawn to drones. I think this idea that you can make a very cautious, thought-out decision,

12:09.040 --> 12:14.400
that you can gather data for hours or even days, and then make a decision that you're going to

12:14.400 --> 12:21.280
excise this person. There's something superficially sort of clean and rational about that,

12:21.280 --> 12:26.960
that appeals to him. President Bush was much more about sort of swagger and shock and awe,

12:27.520 --> 12:34.560
and there's this sort of cold use of violence that typifies the Obama administration. He will be

12:34.560 --> 12:40.800
known, I think, as the drone president. I do find it very ironic that a president with a background

12:40.800 --> 12:46.720
in constitutional law is the president whose administration has said that it has the legal

12:46.720 --> 12:53.120
right to kill American citizens in other countries without any kind of judicial process. I find that

12:53.120 --> 12:58.320
quite disturbing. Many lawyers do as well, lawyers from conservative as well as liberal

12:58.320 --> 13:05.440
backgrounds. A lot of people have the concern that those kind of operations may start happening

13:05.440 --> 13:16.000
inside the United States for many different issues, surveillance, putting privacy and security of

13:16.000 --> 13:20.560
civilians in jeopardy. What do you think about that? Well, I end the book with this very short

13:20.560 --> 13:25.840
chapter where I lay out two possible futures around drones. The future is concerned not only

13:25.840 --> 13:30.560
the use of drones in other countries, but they're used domestically within the United States.

13:31.120 --> 13:36.480
One is sort of a situation where the drones are very well regulated and used in very restricted

13:36.480 --> 13:41.680
ways. The other is the nightmarish scenario for the future, which I'm sorry to say I consider to

13:41.680 --> 13:47.360
be the more likely one. Part of that concerns the possibility of escalating use of drones by

13:47.360 --> 13:54.000
law enforcement within the US. Already, drones are used to police the US-Mexican border, for example.

13:54.000 --> 13:59.280
Now, they're not used in a lethal capacity, they're just used to give us surveillance and

13:59.280 --> 14:05.440
to direct law enforcement on the ground to intercept groups of people coming across that

14:05.440 --> 14:10.880
border illegally. They're also used in domestic law enforcement situations to

14:10.880 --> 14:15.440
overfly demonstrations and so on, but again, just in a surveillance capacity.

14:16.080 --> 14:21.440
I suggest that it's not hard to imagine a situation where there would be some kind of emergency,

14:21.440 --> 14:27.040
you know, someone like the person who killed 50 people in a nightclub in Orlando this weekend

14:27.520 --> 14:33.840
is on the run, highly armed, you're worried they're going to kill more people. And so on a one-time

14:33.840 --> 14:39.200
only basis, you make an exception. You say that if the drone gets this person in their sights,

14:39.200 --> 14:44.080
they're authorized to kill them from the air. And then you've created that precedent, and it becomes

14:44.080 --> 14:48.000
easier to do it the next time when there's another kind of emergency. Gradually, it becomes more and

14:48.000 --> 14:54.400
more routinized. You can imagine that such a course of action would happen where it's sort of

14:54.880 --> 15:00.080
marginal and hated to targets that are at issue. It could be people trying to come across the border

15:00.080 --> 15:07.040
illegally from Mexico. It could be drug dealers. But I can imagine by sort of unintentional stealth,

15:07.040 --> 15:12.640
a set of precedents being set that would lead to a routinization of the use of drones, not only for

15:12.640 --> 15:18.240
surveillance in the US, but for lethal purposes, too. What are your thoughts on the issue of privacy?

15:18.240 --> 15:25.600
Apple versus FBI case would be a good example that it's really becoming more about security versus

15:25.600 --> 15:30.880
freedom to have the kind of information that we want to decide to keep it private. How do you feel

15:30.880 --> 15:36.000
about that? What do you think about it? I know I'm very disturbed by the revelations that we learned

15:36.000 --> 15:44.000
by Edward Snowden about the ways in which the NSA in particular has the capability to gather enormous

15:44.000 --> 15:51.920
amounts of data on American citizens, to listen in on their phone conversations, to track all of

15:51.920 --> 15:57.680
their email, to use their cell phones to monitor their whereabouts and so on. I think in that

15:57.680 --> 16:05.360
respect, drones may not be as much of a concern as the way the NSA can use its information technology,

16:05.360 --> 16:09.760
the information infrastructure, to track our whereabouts, who we talk to, who we meet with,

16:11.040 --> 16:18.320
and so forth. I think for drones, in terms of privacy, the area of concern there may actually

16:18.320 --> 16:23.680
have to do with privately owned drones. You can buy a drone off the shelf from Target or Amazon

16:24.320 --> 16:29.680
for just a few hundred dollars. You could get a nice drone with a nice video capability.

16:29.680 --> 16:34.800
And one can imagine a situation where an angry spouse would use such a drone

16:34.800 --> 16:41.840
to track the behavior of their former partner. You can imagine neighbors buying on their neighbors.

16:41.840 --> 16:48.160
You could imagine sort of peeping drone scenarios and so on. So some of the concerns I have to do

16:48.160 --> 16:53.680
not with government misuse of drones to invade our privacy, but the way citizens can invade each

16:53.680 --> 16:59.040
other's privacy. There have already been a number of instances where people have taken guns and shot

16:59.040 --> 17:04.320
down drones that were over their houses. And so far the courts have ruled in favor of the drone

17:04.320 --> 17:11.360
owners, not the shooters in those cases. One of the conspiracy theorists, most famous

17:11.360 --> 17:17.520
radio host, he started this sport shooting down drones with shotguns and they're doing that in

17:17.520 --> 17:23.600
Texas. Well, I don't recommend that. No, definitely not. And I think there's a real concern if we're

17:23.600 --> 17:30.240
talking about the privately owned drones in terms of terrorism and accident, there have been a number

17:30.240 --> 17:35.280
of instances reported now where privately owned drones have become very close to commercial jet

17:35.280 --> 17:40.560
liners on takeoff and landing from an airport. And the way things are going, if we extrapolate,

17:40.560 --> 17:45.280
it's just a matter of time until one of those drones hits a jetliner. If it gets sucked into

17:45.280 --> 17:51.760
the engine, it's quite possible it could bring a commercial plane down. And I think we have to worry

17:51.760 --> 17:58.080
now it's been done. People have attached handguns and chainsaws to drones and flown them. It'd be

17:58.080 --> 18:04.480
very simple to attach a primitive kind of improvised explosive to a drone. You could imagine attaching

18:04.480 --> 18:10.800
some sort of crude chemical weapon to a drone. So I'm sorry to say this, but we have to worry

18:10.800 --> 18:18.400
about attacks on sports stadiums and public events by people wanting to sell terror and mayhem.

18:18.400 --> 18:24.640
I agree. You mentioned regulating drones. The first thing came to my mind was the guy who made

18:24.640 --> 18:31.360
the open source 3D model of a handgun that anybody can download and 3D print different pieces in

18:31.360 --> 18:36.480
different places and just put them together and just get a bullet and use it. So drones have the

18:36.480 --> 18:42.400
same possibility and anything else that can be used for destructive or beneficial purposes, right?

18:42.400 --> 18:48.800
Yeah. And I want to emphasize that there are beneficial purposes for drones. They used to

18:48.800 --> 18:55.360
inspect high power lines. And if you do those inspections with humans, a number of them get

18:55.360 --> 19:01.200
killed in accidents exposed to high voltage. Much better to do with a drone if you can.

19:01.200 --> 19:06.720
At Fukushima, they've used drones to try and sample radiation levels in a place where you

19:06.720 --> 19:11.680
don't want to send humans in. The World Wildlife Federation uses a drone in Africa to hunt for

19:11.680 --> 19:17.040
poachers. You can use drones to look for mass graves in places where there have been atrocities

19:17.040 --> 19:22.560
to monitor environmental damage and so on. So I mean, there are beneficial uses to these as well.

19:22.560 --> 19:30.160
In terms of the private drone industry, hobbyist drones, I really wish that the US government

19:30.960 --> 19:35.760
had stricter rules for registering these drones. They just announced some rules a few months ago,

19:35.760 --> 19:40.240
and they're extremely weak. If you own a drone, you're supposed to go to a website,

19:40.240 --> 19:46.000
register it, print out a registration number which you put on your drone. It would be much

19:46.000 --> 19:51.680
better if they were registered at the point of sale, if every drone was sold with a unique

19:51.680 --> 19:59.120
registration number, and you were forced to register it when you bought it. Then misbehavior

19:59.120 --> 20:03.360
with drones could be more easily tracked, and there could be realistic penalties for people

20:04.720 --> 20:08.960
who misuse drones either violently or for surveillance.

20:08.960 --> 20:13.200
Do you think that we'll begin to see the same problem that we see with gun control now with

20:13.200 --> 20:17.920
drones? Well, the drone industry isn't nearly as powerful as a lobbying force as the National

20:17.920 --> 20:25.040
Rifle Association, but it looked to me as if the rules that the Obama administration issued a few

20:25.040 --> 20:30.400
months ago were weak, partly because there was a strong lobbying effort by the drone industry.

20:30.400 --> 20:35.200
The book is called Drone Remote Control Warfare. It came out in May, and it's,

20:35.200 --> 20:40.160
I would imagine, available on all the major digital distributors and everywhere that they

20:40.160 --> 20:42.080
sell books, right? Indeed.

20:42.080 --> 20:46.080
With the rise of tension around the world, you mentioned the tragedy in Orlando. Would

20:46.080 --> 20:50.720
it be fair to say that ultimately it's the militarized technology, whether it's drones

20:50.720 --> 20:54.720
or robots or anything else, that will determine the successes and failures?

20:55.280 --> 21:00.480
I think that the war on terror is unwinnable the way that we are currently fighting it,

21:00.480 --> 21:09.840
and it becomes a self-perpetuating phenomenon. Everything that the United States does in order

21:09.840 --> 21:15.360
to win the war on terror, whether it be in Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, seems to

21:15.360 --> 21:23.440
excite further opposition. One notices with the kill lists that are used to determine targets

21:23.440 --> 21:28.640
for the drones, the kill lists get longer. The more people we kill, the longer the kill

21:28.640 --> 21:35.840
lists get. Now, why is that? Part of the reason for that is that the drone strikes excite as

21:35.840 --> 21:40.400
much opposition as they do good. Okay, so you take out an al-Qaeda leader or you take out

21:40.400 --> 21:45.360
a Taliban leader. They're replaced pretty quickly. The person who replaces them is really angry

21:46.080 --> 21:49.840
about what the US did. They have something to prove. They have to prove to their followers

21:49.840 --> 21:57.280
that they're tough. It's not uncommon to find that when a drone takes out an al-Qaeda leader,

21:57.280 --> 22:02.000
the level of violence in that region actually goes up, not down, in the weeks afterwards,

22:02.560 --> 22:07.520
because new, more radical, angry people with something to prove replace the person who was

22:07.520 --> 22:12.800
killed. In the meantime, if the drone strikes are killing innocent civilians, that makes it easier

22:12.800 --> 22:19.520
to recruit new members of the insurgency. At this point, the so-called war on terror is the longest

22:19.520 --> 22:24.560
war the United States has ever fought. The Taliban controls more of Afghanistan right now

22:24.560 --> 22:30.800
than it's controlled in years. It's going nowhere. It's this perpetual war. We're always told there's

22:30.800 --> 22:35.680
some new technology that's finally going to help us turn the corner. It's fool's gold.

22:35.680 --> 22:38.400
So you're not an optimist about the outcome of this war?

22:38.400 --> 22:45.920
I'm not. In Afghanistan, we have to negotiate with the Taliban. We have to get the Afghan

22:45.920 --> 22:49.760
government together with the Taliban and with the US and Europeans at the table as well,

22:49.760 --> 22:57.280
and try to bow out from Afghanistan as gracefully as we can, leave behind some sort of architecture

22:57.280 --> 23:03.760
that will make the country as stable as possible. I assume the American taxpayer in such a situation

23:03.760 --> 23:08.560
would want to wash the hands of the country, which would be a sad mistake. What Afghanistan would need

23:08.560 --> 23:16.000
in such a situation is a lot of material resources to help them rebuild. But it's only through

23:16.000 --> 23:21.680
negotiation and diplomatic settlement that peace and rebuilding will come.

23:21.680 --> 23:28.080
What are your thoughts on Iran? Because one of the outcomes of the beginning years of war on terror

23:28.080 --> 23:33.360
was that the United States got rid of two of Iran's biggest enemies, Taliban on one side, Saddam

23:33.360 --> 23:40.960
Hussein on one side, and that freed up Iran to start their hegemonic exportation of their

23:40.960 --> 23:47.200
Shia interpretation of Islamic revolution. What are your thoughts on that country at this point?

23:47.200 --> 23:54.720
I'm not an expert on Iran, so I want to be very cautious here. My perception of Iran is that it's

23:54.720 --> 24:00.720
a country that's sort of on a knife's edge. The hardliners in Iran feed on the actions from the

24:00.720 --> 24:07.840
hardliners in the United States. So the question is whether the kind of agreement that Obama reached

24:07.840 --> 24:14.880
with moderates will open space for a gradual democratic evolution in Iran. And I really

24:14.880 --> 24:24.160
wouldn't care to predict the answer, but I do know that just taking a hardline action in the past

24:24.160 --> 24:29.280
wasn't getting us anywhere. Do you see the chance of a new nuclear arm race this time in Middle East

24:29.280 --> 24:33.600
as a consequence of the nuclear agreement with Iran? Because one of the first reactions that we

24:33.600 --> 24:38.240
saw was from Saudi Arabia, that they asked for the exact same privileges that Iran got with their

24:38.240 --> 24:44.560
nuclear program. And we know that if Saudi Arabia and Emirates and Qatar and those people decide to

24:44.560 --> 24:48.320
get nuclear weapons, they don't need to develop a program. They can just buy it from Pakistan.

24:51.840 --> 24:58.560
I'm a supporter of the nuclear agreement with Iran. It was clear that despite the sanctions,

24:58.560 --> 25:04.320
the Iranians were able to keep making progress in the direction of a nuclear weapon. I don't

25:04.320 --> 25:08.960
think it was established that they intended to build the weapon. It looked to me as if they

25:08.960 --> 25:13.520
wanted to have the capability to build the weapon. Should they ever make that decision?

25:13.520 --> 25:18.080
It wasn't clear to me that that decision had been made. The nuclear agreement does put them

25:18.080 --> 25:24.160
several months backwards from there by dismantling all those centrifuges, ticking away some of the

25:24.160 --> 25:31.120
highly enriched uranium that they had. I would hope that more reasonable actors in countries

25:31.120 --> 25:37.280
like Saudi Arabia would feel reassured rather than threatened by the agreement with Iran,

25:37.280 --> 25:43.680
and particularly the inspectors' access makes it harder for the Iranians to hide bad things.

25:45.520 --> 25:51.200
But one can understand how symbolically a rapprochement between Iran and the United

25:51.200 --> 25:57.280
States would be threatening to city powers in the region, and for that reason, they might feel that

25:57.280 --> 25:59.840
they wanted to move closer to a weapons capability.

25:59.840 --> 26:03.040
From the point of view of an anthropologist...

26:03.040 --> 26:05.280
Can I just say one more thing about the Middle East issue, by the way?

26:05.280 --> 26:05.920
Of course.

26:05.920 --> 26:10.160
I noticed that when we discuss nuclear proliferation in the United States, and we talk about the

26:10.160 --> 26:14.720
countries that have nuclear weapons, there is one country that's always somehow forgotten,

26:15.760 --> 26:19.280
and it's in the Middle East, and it's not a Muslim country. It's Israel.

26:19.280 --> 26:20.080
Israel, yes.

26:20.080 --> 26:25.520
Israel has its thoughts about 100 nuclear weapons. Some of them may be hydrogen bombs,

26:25.520 --> 26:35.760
according to some accounts. It's the foundational assumption of realist thinking in security

26:35.760 --> 26:40.400
studies that it's very dangerous to have a region where one side has nuclear weapons and the other

26:40.400 --> 26:49.520
doesn't. We should worry that the agreement with Iran may be provocative to Saudi Arabia and so on,

26:49.520 --> 26:52.640
but the deeper concern that we should have is that we have a region there

26:53.200 --> 27:00.480
where one country that feels extremely insecure about its right to exist has a monopoly in the

27:00.480 --> 27:06.320
region on weapons of mass destruction, and something has to be done about that situation.

27:06.320 --> 27:08.160
It can't just be left alone.

27:08.160 --> 27:13.760
The argument, as I understand it, from the Israeli side is that Israel needs to win every single war

27:13.760 --> 27:17.760
because they can't afford to lose even one. If they lose one, they're going to be banished

27:17.760 --> 27:21.920
from the face of the earth, as Iranians, for example, are calling it for.

27:21.920 --> 27:22.320
Yeah.

27:22.320 --> 27:27.280
So they're using that as a status and defense of measures. What do you think?

27:28.000 --> 27:31.280
First of all, just a sort of footnote on banishing Israel from the face of the earth.

27:31.280 --> 27:38.080
That's a quote from Ahmadinejad when he was leader of Iran, and friends who are experts

27:38.080 --> 27:44.000
in Iran do tell me that his comment there was mistranslated. But what he said was that over

27:44.000 --> 27:49.120
the sands of time would erase Israel. It wasn't that there was a threat that Iran would make it

27:49.120 --> 27:52.880
happen. He just predicted that it would go away. But that to one side, you know-

27:52.880 --> 27:58.240
Just a note. It was said by, in the very beginning of the revolution, I'm originally from Iran,

27:59.600 --> 28:05.920
by Ayatollah Khomeini, who was the leader of the revolution that Israel needs to,

28:05.920 --> 28:11.760
we need to wipe Israel off the map. And what Ahmadinejad says, even though he was not

28:11.760 --> 28:18.160
interpreted exactly as what he said it, but I don't think it has any kind of practicality

28:18.160 --> 28:24.400
to wipe down any country, but they're using that for their internal purposes and also getting

28:24.400 --> 28:30.000
together a lot of Muslims in the region who just don't like Israel.

28:30.000 --> 28:36.400
Yeah. Well, we can easily understand why Israel would feel deeply insecure. I mean, it's been

28:36.400 --> 28:46.320
attacked in 1967, 1973. There have been attempts by its neighbors to either wipe it off the map

28:46.320 --> 28:51.840
or steal lots of its territory. It's a very small, non-Arab country surrounded by very

28:51.840 --> 28:57.040
militarized Arab countries. So you can understand why it would feel insecure and why it would want

28:57.040 --> 29:03.680
to have a nuclear deterrent. At the same time, it has a history of acting quite aggressively

29:03.680 --> 29:10.160
towards its neighbors. And so its nuclear stockpile and its other foreign policy actions

29:10.160 --> 29:15.440
will make its neighbors feel insecure as well. This is the way militarism works. People feel

29:15.440 --> 29:21.040
insecure about another country that has a weapons capability because it feels insecure about you,

29:21.040 --> 29:26.480
and it becomes this action-reaction cycle that can, if it's not controlled, lead to disaster.

29:27.920 --> 29:31.840
And so as long as Israel has nuclear weapons, one can imagine why some of Israel's

29:31.840 --> 29:36.400
neighbors might want to acquire them too. From the point of view of an anthropologist,

29:36.400 --> 29:42.880
can we get rid of war altogether? In other words, can humans at their current state of evolution

29:42.880 --> 29:48.800
operate without war? Great question. So many people say that war is just part of human nature.

29:48.800 --> 29:55.360
The anthropological records suggest otherwise. Aggression and violence is certainly part of

29:55.360 --> 30:00.320
the human experience everywhere. Anthropologists have found no society where people don't, from

30:00.320 --> 30:04.720
time to time, kill each other and attack each other and get into conflicts. But that's different

30:04.720 --> 30:10.400
from war. Warfare is a social institution. It's quite different from beating up your spouse or

30:10.400 --> 30:14.400
getting into a fistfight with someone in a bar. That's not war. That's aggression and violence.

30:15.200 --> 30:20.480
Anthropologists have found a number of societies that have no experience of organized warfare,

30:20.480 --> 30:25.920
that have no experience of organized warfare, not even a word for warfare. Unfortunately,

30:25.920 --> 30:31.600
these societies were egalitarian hunter-gatherer types of societies that have largely been wiped

30:31.600 --> 30:38.160
out by colonialism, industrialization, and modernization. But it does suggest that it's

30:38.160 --> 30:42.880
within the capability of the human species, it is part of our potential repertoire

30:42.880 --> 30:49.760
to live without warfare as an organized institution. Very interesting. Back to nuclear

30:49.760 --> 30:56.000
weapons, they have been perhaps the most serious of a threat to the planet and the civilization's

30:56.000 --> 31:01.440
safety and security. How have they evolved in their approach towards nuclear weapons since the

31:01.440 --> 31:08.000
end of Cold War? And how do you see this evolution continue? So the way the United States and the

31:08.000 --> 31:14.480
Soviet Union conducted the nuclear arms race during the Cold War is that they were constantly

31:14.480 --> 31:20.720
competing with one another, both quantitatively and qualitatively. They were trying to build up

31:20.720 --> 31:26.480
larger stockpiles than each other, and they were trying to design new kinds of weapons with new

31:26.480 --> 31:31.760
kinds of capabilities. That might have meant... It didn't necessarily mean that they were more

31:31.760 --> 31:35.280
destructive, that the warheads were more destructive. It might have meant that the

31:35.280 --> 31:40.640
destructiveness was customized in some way, that you would minimize the blast effect but

31:40.640 --> 31:44.480
optimize the radiation output, as in the neutron bomb or something like that.

31:45.120 --> 31:51.280
Many of the qualitative improvements of weapons in the Cold War had to do with accuracy or with

31:51.280 --> 31:56.560
putting lots and lots of warheads on a single missile. So in the 70s, both sides figured out

31:56.560 --> 32:01.120
how to move their missiles. That's to put multiple warheads on the missiles. So you could launch one

32:01.120 --> 32:07.200
missile, but you could destroy 10 cities with it half an hour later when it reentered the atmosphere

32:07.200 --> 32:10.880
or trying to make them so accurate that they could land within 100 feet of their target.

32:13.120 --> 32:20.560
They built enormous stockpiles, 70,000 nuclear weapons at its height in the Cold War, an

32:20.560 --> 32:28.880
astonishing number of these weapons. Interestingly, the pursuit of security through qualitative and

32:28.880 --> 32:34.400
quantitative improvements actually produced insecurity. So the more accurate the weapons

32:34.400 --> 32:39.680
became, the more each side worried that the other side might be able to preemptively destroy its

32:39.680 --> 32:45.280
weapons before it could use them. In particular, the moving of the weapons, putting multiple

32:45.280 --> 32:51.760
warheads on them, increased the risk that one country could destroy 10 of the other countries'

32:51.760 --> 32:56.400
missiles with just one missile of its own, because each missile could send 10 warheads

32:56.400 --> 33:04.400
at different targets. So by the end of the Cold War, both sides were much less secure and safe

33:04.400 --> 33:07.600
than they had been at the beginning of the arms race. There were more of the weapons,

33:07.600 --> 33:12.320
they were more accurate, and the configuration had become much less stable from an deterrence

33:12.320 --> 33:17.760
point of view. What has happened since then is that there's been an enormous diminution in the

33:17.760 --> 33:23.280
number of the weapons. So the US now only has 7,000 weapons, and many of them are sort of in the

33:23.280 --> 33:28.720
closet. They're not on active deployment. They're on sort of reserve standby status.

33:28.720 --> 33:33.600
So the numbers have come down. There's still enough that you could effectively end most of

33:33.600 --> 33:39.120
human life on the planet, which is not good, but the numbers have come down. No one has tested a

33:39.120 --> 33:43.520
nuclear weapon since India and Pakistan. Well, I guess the North Koreans have tested nuclear

33:43.520 --> 33:49.520
weapons, but the superpowers haven't tested nuclear weapons since the early 1990s. The US

33:49.520 --> 33:56.320
hasn't done a nuclear test since September 1992. So both countries are pretty much stuck with the

33:56.320 --> 34:02.400
stockpiles that they used to have. In the absence of nuclear testing, you can sort of maintain the

34:02.400 --> 34:08.080
old weapons and make sure they work, but you can't design new ones with fundamentally new capabilities.

34:08.080 --> 34:14.080
And that itself is a stabilizing factor. Now, the problem is that this technology is now pretty old

34:14.080 --> 34:19.600
technology. I mean, it was developed in the 1940s originally. A group of physics undergraduates at

34:19.600 --> 34:23.600
one of our leading universities, if they had access to the nuclear material, could easily

34:23.600 --> 34:29.600
make a nuclear weapon that would work very well. And that means that the danger of proliferation,

34:29.600 --> 34:35.040
including to terrorist groups, to subnational actors, is greatly increased. So what we're seeing

34:35.040 --> 34:39.200
in terms of the nuclear policy debate, which I find very interesting, is there are a number of

34:39.200 --> 34:44.800
people who used to be hawks, who used to believe in the arms race, who have now become nuclear

34:44.800 --> 34:49.360
abolitionists. I'm thinking of people like William Perry, who was Secretary of Defense under Bill

34:49.360 --> 34:56.480
Clinton, Henry Kissinger, and William Schultz, who was Secretary of State for Ronald Reagan.

34:56.480 --> 35:02.320
They now advocate the abolition of nuclear weapons. And I think the reason that they advocate this

35:02.880 --> 35:08.240
is that they're terrified that terrorists and subnational actors will get their hands on this

35:08.240 --> 35:12.960
technology if it stays around. We mentioned being terrified of terrorists. I want to ask you about

35:12.960 --> 35:20.320
Donald Trump, if you don't mind. Sure. You being in Washington, you're in the center of this crazy

35:20.320 --> 35:27.360
show, I would say, that is going on in the US politics now. How do you feel about the very

35:27.360 --> 35:33.680
possibility of Donald Trump presidency, and as famously said by many people, his fingers being

35:33.680 --> 35:40.160
on the nuclear coats? Well, I can't say it makes me terribly happy. I noticed my daughter, who's in

35:40.160 --> 35:45.440
third grade, came home one day and said, so what country are we moving to if Donald Trump wins?

35:48.480 --> 35:51.520
Apparently, it's penetrated the consciousness of third graders in Washington.

35:52.800 --> 35:57.920
The guy is unpredictable. With nuclear weapons, unpredictability is not a good thing.

35:57.920 --> 36:04.640
What the superpowers learned over time is that you want cool-headed people who think carefully

36:04.640 --> 36:10.240
before they act. They don't do things rashly. They talk a lot to their enemies. If they make threats,

36:10.240 --> 36:16.640
the threats are very carefully coded. They leave themselves space so they can back down if the

36:16.640 --> 36:23.200
threats aren't met. That doesn't sound much like Donald Trump to me. What is the future of war?

36:23.200 --> 36:28.720
What is the future of war? Well, I would hope it doesn't have much of a future, but at the moment,

36:28.720 --> 36:34.720
it looks like it has a very good future. The future of war will look very different in

36:35.440 --> 36:41.120
advanced industrial countries like the United States and in parts of Africa and Asia and so on.

36:42.000 --> 36:48.320
What we see in the Middle East and in Africa right now is that there's increasing hybridization

36:48.320 --> 36:54.720
between warfare and gang violence and the black economy and drug trafficking and so on.

36:55.360 --> 37:01.600
It creates an utterly miserable situation for ordinary people. It produces these mass

37:01.600 --> 37:05.680
flows of migrants that we're seeing out of the Middle East, particularly Syria right now.

37:07.520 --> 37:12.000
People in the United States are terrified of terrorist attack and so on, but they get off

37:12.000 --> 37:15.920
pretty lightly. Warfare is largely something that happens in other people's territory.

37:15.920 --> 37:21.440
There's a strong faith in the United States that technology will keep us safe. The technologies

37:21.440 --> 37:25.360
that the United States are talking about for the next generation have to do with an

37:25.360 --> 37:31.200
intensification of surveillance and something I find somewhat troubling, a strong move to

37:31.200 --> 37:36.640
artificial intelligence. These would be autonomous weapons. It's not just that the drone would not

37:36.640 --> 37:41.680
have a pilot in it, but it wouldn't even be operated by someone from Nevada. You would

37:41.680 --> 37:46.080
program it how to tell terrorists from civilians, and it would make its own decisions to attack.

37:46.800 --> 37:50.640
And who's responsible when it makes a mistake and destroys a village? I don't know.

37:51.280 --> 37:56.080
Speaking of artificial intelligence and the whole technological advancement that we're

37:56.080 --> 38:00.880
experiencing, how are we evolving as species in the 21st century?

38:00.880 --> 38:05.040
Well, genetically, we're not evolving very much at all, though I guess there are technologies

38:05.040 --> 38:09.600
that hold out the prospect that we could take charge of our genetic evolution.

38:09.600 --> 38:15.600
But as a species, we're evolving in a direction where there's this increasing chasm between

38:15.600 --> 38:21.040
societies, between the have and the have-not societies, and within societies, between the

38:21.040 --> 38:29.600
haves and the have-nots. What academics call neoliberalism, which is this brutal intensification

38:29.600 --> 38:35.840
of capitalism that we've seen in the last 20 or 30 years, is sort of rolling back the clock on

38:35.840 --> 38:42.320
gains that were made against inequality following World War II. All of the metrics show that the

38:42.320 --> 38:48.240
United States is becoming a more and more unequal society, so we seem to be evolving in a direction

38:48.240 --> 38:54.400
of more and more inequality, which can only create social problems. It is likely to create

38:55.200 --> 39:01.280
more violence within society. At the same time, societies are becoming more and more multicultural.

39:01.280 --> 39:06.640
So I think one of the interesting questions that the Trump campaign raises, if you could

39:06.640 --> 39:11.760
put Trump side-by-side with Bernie Sanders, you see that there are two narrative responses to

39:11.760 --> 39:18.560
neoliberalism there. Bernie Sanders is saying it's about inequality between classes and trying to

39:18.560 --> 39:23.920
encourage people to think about inequality in economic terms. Trump is encouraging people

39:23.920 --> 39:29.600
in a multicultural context to think through inequality in terms of inequality and inequality.

39:29.600 --> 39:35.200
Through inequality in terms of what ethnic others they want to scapegoat. So I think a major

39:35.200 --> 39:41.120
political question for the United States in the next 10 years is how we will react to the objective

39:41.120 --> 39:46.960
increase in inequality. Will we do it through increasing racial tension and ethnic scapegoating?

39:46.960 --> 39:53.040
Or will we see the return of sort of mass class-based movements like those of the 1930s

39:53.040 --> 39:57.040
that might span different ethnic groups? How can we get ready for such a future?

39:57.040 --> 40:01.360
By talking about it, thinking about it, talking to our friends and our neighbors about it.

40:01.360 --> 40:05.360
Professors have to talk about it in their classes. Novelists have to write about it.

40:05.360 --> 40:10.880
Hollywood movie makers have to make movies about it. Politicians have to turn their backs on the

40:10.880 --> 40:17.760
special interest donations and talk honestly about it. Just out of curiosity, what percentage of

40:18.560 --> 40:23.760
the nuclear scientists that you were studying were women? It will sound like a low percentage

40:23.760 --> 40:30.240
because it was something like 6 or 7%. The objective numbers I have are from the 80s,

40:30.240 --> 40:34.000
so I should caution your listeners that those numbers have surely changed since then.

40:34.960 --> 40:40.160
But in the 80s, it was 6 or 7%. That may sound pretty terrible, but actually,

40:40.160 --> 40:44.400
if you looked at the percentage of American PhDs in physics that went to women,

40:44.400 --> 40:51.200
women were overrepresented in the weapons labs. I know a number of women nuclear weapons designers.

40:51.200 --> 40:54.880
They like to joke that women are better at nuclear weapons design than men

40:54.880 --> 40:59.280
because they think holistically. A kind of technical problem that requires

40:59.280 --> 41:04.720
holistic thinking where you understand how one parameter changes in sync with other parameters

41:04.720 --> 41:10.480
and so on. At Los Alamos, there is a nuclear weapons design and crocheting group.

41:11.040 --> 41:16.960
Interesting. The book is called Drone Remote Control Warfare. We've been speaking with

41:16.960 --> 41:23.280
Hugh Gusterson for the past 40 minutes. I'm going to ask you the last question. I'm asking

41:23.280 --> 41:28.800
all my guests that if you come across an intelligent alien from a different civilization,

41:28.800 --> 41:33.600
what would you say is the worst thing humanity has done and what would you say is humanity's

41:33.600 --> 41:39.280
greatest achievement? I should have listened to the end of your other shows so I know what

41:39.280 --> 41:48.080
other people said. The worst thing has to be some of the terrible atrocities of the 20th century,

41:48.080 --> 41:54.240
Auschwitz, Hiroshima, the mass killing that we've engaged in, Rwanda.

41:56.080 --> 42:04.080
The best thing, some of our wonderful music, some of our wonderful plays, Shakespeare movies.

42:04.080 --> 42:09.360
I don't know if an alien would really understand that. We don't know if aliens would appreciate art.
