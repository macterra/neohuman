1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
moving beyond the earth, leaving the solar system, moving to other stars, leaving the earth behind,

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:15,760
are our obligations to ourselves, our obligations to the earth itself, our obligations to life,

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:25,440
our obligations to the universe, and, even though Stephen doesn't use explicitly religious words,

4
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:35,360
our obligation to God. Now, this is the ethos that I recommend, which is basically a reformulation

5
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:45,040
of the Cosmic ethos in a language that is more understandable to people here and now.

6
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:57,600
Julia Prisco, welcome back to New Human Podcast, this time the 98th episode, sir.

7
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,480
Thank you very much for having me again. I enjoyed our last conversation last year.

8
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:11,840
Yes, indeed. It was right after the first launch of astronauts with SpaceX reusable rocket,

9
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:22,240
which I know you're very adamant in following what's going on with respect to space exploration

10
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,000
and SpaceX and all that, and that was my second launch that I saw, and I recently just saw my

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,200
fifth launch, which every single time it really is a spiritual experience, which again is good to

12
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,760
talk to you because you're talking about science technology, but also about spirituality and

13
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:47,040
religious aspect of what is going on in our civilization. So, congratulations for your new

14
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,920
book, which is the main reason we're having this discussion. Future is Spaceflight Meditations,

15
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,960
which came out recently, I believe, and it's available on Amazon and everywhere else. The

16
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,680
digital and printed books are available. And audiobook, is it also available?

17
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:12,960
Uh, no, no, not audio book yet. Um, so we're gonna, also because, uh, you know, I understand

18
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:20,080
that many people like audio book, the things here. I like, I like, I love reading so very much

19
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:27,760
that, you know, for me, uh, depriving myself of the pleasure of reading, uh, written words

20
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:35,520
is unthinkable. And, uh, well, but I do know that many people like, uh, like audio books.

21
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:42,960
Yeah. By the way, let me just get a copy. Great. I also show it, um, as we talk about it. Yeah,

22
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:50,880
wonderful. And this is a follow-up. Would it be fair to say that this is a follow-up to your first

23
00:02:50,880 --> 00:03:00,880
book, Tales of the Touring Church? It's much less general. Uh, I would, uh, I prefer to say that it

24
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:08,400
is a zoom on one, uh, chapter in Tales of the Touring Church, the chapter where I discuss

25
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,840
space exploration. And since I believe, uh, that chapter is one of the most important in

26
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,800
Tales of the Touring Church, I thought to expand it, uh, in a standalone book. We're definitely

27
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,360
going to talk about it, but as I mentioned before we start recording, we'll go in public.

28
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,640
I want to talk to you about a blog post that you had that, uh, the title is, I have resigned from

29
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,680
the IEET board of directors. Would you mind if I read just the beginning of your post just so our

30
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:51,600
audience can have some kind of a opinion? Um, uh, um, I was kind of hoping to avoid that, but anyway,

31
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:57,520
let's go. Please do. I have resigned from the board of directors of the Institute for Ethics and

32
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:04,000
Emerging Technologies, IEET. I have resigned in protest against a recent decision which hasn't

33
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,840
been publicly announced yet. Like much of today's liberal left, the IEET has embraced certain

34
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,760
currently fashionable by dangerously toxic trends, identity politics, Me Too, cancel culture. These

35
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,920
trends start with good sentiments, but become toxic and dangerous when pushed to unreasonable

36
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:27,920
and often ridiculous extremes. And the reason I wanted to start with this is because I believe

37
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:35,120
that what's going on with respect to an underlaying of technological debate and developments that we

38
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:42,160
are dealing with, there is a war of ethos. There is a war of philosophical aspect of what it is that

39
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,840
we are doing, what is the purpose of it, where we are headed and why we are doing what we are

40
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:54,000
doing. And so I think this is related because in many fields, especially AI ethics, this is

41
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,840
almost entirely occupied by people who are coming from that political perspective, that

42
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,640
philosophical perspective that you can call it far left, extreme left, whatever you want to call it,

43
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:14,480
so liberal left as you're calling it. So I just want you to very generally talk a little about it

44
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:21,920
before we get into your book, just so we know what was the problem with this organization, not exactly

45
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,720
but just let's hear it from you.

46
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:39,440
Okay, and as a matter of fact, I do discuss these things in the book as well. And my last book,

47
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:47,840
Future is the Space Flight Meditation, is one of the very few writings in which I have gone

48
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:56,800
into any kind of detail about what I think of what's happening in the world of politics

49
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:04,960
and especially culture. I don't really like to discuss these things and in fact I almost never

50
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:17,760
write about this for essentially two reasons. The first is that it's a complete waste of time

51
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:30,160
because as things are today, you will not persuade anyone when discussing the politics and

52
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:37,760
culture. Nobody will persuade you. What will happen instead is that you will start calling

53
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:44,800
each other names and I just don't have the time for that. It's a complete waste of time. I prefer

54
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:51,760
to dedicate my time to other things. But there is also another reason why I'm kind of reluctant

55
00:06:52,640 --> 00:07:01,920
to discuss these things and it is that, you know, the world in which we live today is so

56
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,600
toxically polarized. For example, in the United States

57
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:16,960
we have a situation where 40 percent of the people hate and are hated by the other 40 percent.

58
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:25,440
It's a very heated situation. It's not good. It's not healthy. It's not something that can lead us

59
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:37,920
anywhere good. So I kind of feel that my responsibility as a citizen is to stay in the

60
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:48,960
is to stay away from this debate. I don't want to contribute to blowing on a fire

61
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:59,360
that could become a very dangerous one so that I normally stay out of these things. In my writings

62
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:06,240
I focus on other things. In my social media posts on Facebook and Twitter I also focus on other

63
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:14,880
things. I almost entirely ignore politics just like every now and then because, you know, I think

64
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:26,720
this is the responsible thing to do. Let's just talk of something else and let's just discuss

65
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:37,920
something else. Now concerning this IEET episode, let's just say that there was a decision

66
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:47,040
taken by a very narrow majority vote by the rest of the vote

67
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:58,080
and I did not agree at all with this decision. My disagreement was so strong that I resigned

68
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,320
from the board and I was kind of sad of doing that because, you know, I had been one of the

69
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:10,560
co-founders of the Institute of Ethics and Emerging Technologies back in 2004

70
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:18,480
and I was full of enthusiasm at that time because I thought the Institute would

71
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:30,320
really amount to something one day but now that it has fallen to cancel culture I don't think

72
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:39,040
it's likely to go anywhere and here again I have better things to do with my time and so I preferred

73
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:50,400
to part ways as friendly as possible of course but I was just not interested in continuing to be part

74
00:09:51,520 --> 00:10:01,120
of that organization. Now coming to what exactly was the episode that

75
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:11,920
prompted me to resign from the IEET. I'm not at liberty to say it and I'm not at liberty to say it

76
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:26,320
because it was a discussion among the board of an organization and the discussion led to a decision

77
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:35,840
that has never been communicated to the public as far as I am aware so that, you know, since

78
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:48,480
it's not a public decision I'm not at liberty to comment on it. Now of course many people have

79
00:10:48,480 --> 00:11:00,880
guessed correctly exactly what decision I was talking about and let's just say that it's not

80
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:08,480
that difficult to guess. Yeah I think a lot of us want to leave politicization alone just so we can

81
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,080
do the stuff that we like but the problem is that the politicization by totalitarians is not leaving

82
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,840
us alone, you know, to do whatever we want to do so everything is being politicized and I think it

83
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,520
goes back to again a discussion that we had the first time that we talked about I think we

84
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,080
disagreed with respect to for example Mormon Transhumanist Association that you said that

85
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:39,680
it's actually a beneficial thing for religions to adopt into or religions to yeah adopt a modern

86
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,840
technological kind of a framework within themselves and this seems to be to be the same thing that

87
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:53,040
certain kind of people from certain political perspectives they are basically monopolizing

88
00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:00,000
on their ethos on their perspective and then using technology in order to empower that and this is

89
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,560
affecting every single one of us ultimately that's that's one of the reasons that I wanted to start

90
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:16,960
with this. I can agree with that and there's also another reason why one unfortunately cannot keep

91
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:27,360
so far from politics as one would wish it is when you know the things that really interest you depend

92
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:39,120
on political decisions that may or may not be made and this is exactly the case of space flight

93
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:48,000
and this is the reason why I do discuss political and cultural issues in my book because you know

94
00:12:48,000 --> 00:13:01,920
it's very good that private space flight operators like Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos are doing all the

95
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:13,200
wonderful things that they are doing but I'm not too optimistic when it comes to

96
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,920
to their ability to do these things

97
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:33,600
not only without government support but even in presence of some kind of opposition from the

98
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:47,920
political world and this is a very likely a risk that we will be facing you are reading of course

99
00:13:47,920 --> 00:14:03,200
of this declaration that of influences that you know this space program of billionaires are not

100
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:12,240
something good and this and that and blah blah and I think there is a very real danger that

101
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:20,560
uh in countries like the United States the administration may become more and more hostile

102
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:32,240
to private commercial space flight ventures and at the same time of course we cannot

103
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:41,680
rely on the government alone to take us back to the moon and then beyond because you know

104
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:47,200
we have been waiting for that for 50 years and that hasn't happened which means that this will

105
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:58,880
not happen without some being uh changing factor like the advent of private space flight so I do

106
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:10,800
not think that our expansion into space can proceed at this moment without at least some

107
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:19,120
moderate support from the government and that means that unfortunately politics is still very

108
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:31,440
much related to space flight and of course culture overall is also very much related to space flight

109
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:39,520
and these are things that I could not ignore in a book dedicated to space flight as simple as that

110
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:46,640
yeah absolutely do you see this competition and conflict that is going on between US and China

111
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:53,760
help development of further and further technology that I would imagine that you're considering

112
00:15:53,760 --> 00:16:00,000
space exploration to be the objective and goal of all of these technological advancements that

113
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:10,480
we're experiencing correct not only space exploration space expansion is not exploration

114
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:18,000
for the sake of science it's much deeper than that it is that we need to expand our habitat

115
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:32,000
our human habitat beyond uh this uh planet and uh you know is not exploring a mass to see what mass

116
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:42,000
is like is like it's more uh settling mass to enable large numbers of people to eventually live

117
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:51,520
there and then move beyond so yes space expansion is uh what I'm really interested in do you see the

118
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:58,560
conflict between US and China helps this space expansion as a matter of um survival if not

119
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:11,360
if not anything else yes it's uh it is really a matter of survival and uh you know helps uh uh it

120
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:21,280
can help in uh two different ways one is that you know uh China will just go to the moon and

121
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:29,520
will just colonize mass and uh this is the possibility that over the rest of this century

122
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:39,760
it will be China that uh leads human expansion in the solar system if this happens I think this is

123
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:49,280
good I mean what it's important for me is that humanity expands beyond the earth now whether

124
00:17:49,280 --> 00:18:00,000
that humanity is American humanity or Chinese humanity or African or whatever is a very secondary

125
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:08,160
consideration to me the important thing is that we do it as human beings who does it first it's

126
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:19,680
less important and this is one of the reasons why I'm a while uh I mean I'm not a fan of today's China

127
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:27,360
on the contrary I am very critical of today's China because you know I keep reading about this

128
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,560
how do they call it social control system something like that

129
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:42,800
that they basically want social credit score what they basically want to achieve is a society

130
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:53,040
where everyone is monitored from the cradle to the grave 24 seven every day by the government

131
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:02,480
and of course they will be monitoring the compliance of the citizens to all that the

132
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:10,400
Chinese communist party thinks is good and well I think this is no good I'm not a fan of that kind

133
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:19,920
of social organization not at all but while I'm not a fan of the social organization system of

134
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:34,400
today's China you know I am a fan of humanity moving to settle space so if it is inevitable

135
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:44,480
that China takes the lead then I say okay why not welcome to China now of course for me

136
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:55,280
uh this is a easier to say than for an American because I'm not an American so I have

137
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:09,200
had and still have a great admiration for America I'm not a citizen I do not live in America so that

138
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:18,560
you know if it's America or China if you ask me that okay well I would like to see a continued

139
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:29,520
leadership of America but if it has to be China so be it but going back to America what I think

140
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:41,280
is that at this moment the only thing that can revitalize the US space program and make sure

141
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:52,880
that it stays vital is competition with China uh this example competition is good if there is

142
00:20:52,880 --> 00:21:05,120
an immediate and credible threat that China could be about to achieve space supremacy in the

143
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:14,080
cislunar space and of course convert that space supremacy into geopolitical and even military

144
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:23,600
advantage here on the earth that I think would be something that no American administration regardless

145
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:36,560
of its political color could ever afford to ignore and I think that is happening now

146
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:47,120
and I think it is good I mean without uh China I'm not very optimistic about the US administration

147
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:56,400
to give any damn about space with China they have to yeah that's a very good point space maximalism

148
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,880
basically now whatever is going to happen is going to happen for as long as we get to where we are

149
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:10,080
supposed to be getting which is popularizing the solar system first and then beyond with humanity

150
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:18,480
yes I think this is a good time to read the beginning of your book and then get some

151
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:25,520
ideas from you that why this was right now was the right time to write and publish this book

152
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:32,960
you're saying in the introduction we must strenuously push toward our cosmic destiny among

153
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:40,160
the stars beginning to expand beyond the earth before it's too late is our most important task

154
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:45,600
at this moment in history many actors have important roles to play and there's room for

155
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:52,160
everyone space flight will also help find viable solutions for current developmental environmental

156
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:59,440
and social problems but the road to the stars is full of impediments and roadblocks we will not

157
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:06,640
advance as fast as we wish therefore we must keep our moods strenuous and our drive strong we need

158
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:13,360
an optimistic space flight culture oriented to the future with energizing visions of interplanetary

159
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:19,760
interstellar and cosmic futures we also need a futurist space philosophy which I totally agree

160
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:26,880
and that's exactly why I said that this war over the ethos that is now being politicized is essential

161
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,960
with respect to our technological advancement and space expansion

162
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:42,000
well you have read the first two paragraphs of the book and after that perhaps there is no need

163
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:51,920
that you read the rest of the book because what I wanted is to say in these very short paragraphs

164
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:58,720
exactly what the book was about but no I'm joking I think that's the thesis that is the thesis of

165
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:08,000
your very other right right right yes I'm saying the most important things here at first

166
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:17,680
that you know moving beyond the earth leaving all over the solar system one day

167
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:27,600
leaving even the solar system beyond and moving to other stars is you know it is the most important

168
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:34,480
thing because it's what we have to do it's built in our genes that's what humans do

169
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:44,640
and it's also kind of an obligation to the earth to life and to the very universe an obligation that

170
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:53,040
we have to bring life out there of course there is other life out there but we have something to add

171
00:24:53,040 --> 00:25:05,200
but we have something to add and adding this something that we can add is an existential

172
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:16,240
imperative for humanity so this is my consideration number one now it's a philosophical position

173
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:27,840
and I cannot expect everyone else to automatically agree with my philosophical position if I don't

174
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:38,480
persuade them first and persuading them has to be based on arguments that they can accept

175
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:50,000
that they can accept that's why I dedicate a big part of the book to describe some

176
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:59,920
practical benefits in terms of economy in terms of national security in terms of environmental

177
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:12,720
protection social justice that space flight will bring I tried to persuade those who do not

178
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:20,160
immediately relate to my overall philosophical position that we must

179
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:26,320
expand into space because we must expand into space because it's our cosmic destiny

180
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:34,800
so this was the second important thing the third important thing is a reflection on the history

181
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:44,320
of the last few decades you know where you are younger than me a little bit and yeah you are not

182
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:55,360
on July 20 1969 you are not even alive I was I was 11 years old and I was watching this extreme

183
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:05,600
extremely bad quality video image on a black and white tv and it was like oh this is our future

184
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:13,680
and this is my future I was a kid I thought that when I turned 25 or 30 there would be a city on

185
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:19,840
the moon where I could move to this is where we landed on I'm just saying for people who don't know

186
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:29,600
yes yeah yeah we had so many great expectations all the hits of my generation and we have been

187
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:39,760
frustrated because after 1972 we have never been back to the moon now we might be back to the moon

188
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:49,440
before the end of this decade perhaps I'm not even 100% sure of that so maybe things are moving

189
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:58,000
again but one thing is true is that it has taken a lot more than we thought and things will continue

190
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:11,920
to be that way I mean is inevitable then in a complex world with technology finance politics

191
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:18,480
and culture and all that we will not advance as fast as we would like to advance on the road to

192
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:28,000
the stars but we need to keep our enthusiasm alive and here is where I come to the paramount

193
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:42,320
importance of cultural factors we need to uh engineer cultural factors that uh permit

194
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:51,760
a sustainable space program over the next few decades regardless of the roadblocks and

195
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:59,520
difficulties and lack of money and political opposition that we will inevitably encounter

196
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,640
this is the importance of

197
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:11,920
popularizing space this is the importance of good science fiction this is the importance of new

198
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:19,440
spiritual movements related to the space expansion of humanity these things are extremely important

199
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:28,800
and uh this is uh what my own work is mostly related to

200
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,280
you had mentioned in the book that you start writing it right after the first launch of

201
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:43,440
astronauts by space x reusable rocket right what made you think that this is the right time

202
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,920
to write this book and who exactly are you talking to is the general public or is this

203
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:54,560
a specific group of um people with influence and power what was the what was the objective

204
00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:07,440
and what inspired it when it did uh you know if the those in the general public want to read my

205
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:19,520
book i can only be happy of that at the same time i understand that those who do not already agree

206
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:31,840
with me on most things may find it difficult to relate personally to my book because i say

207
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:43,200
very clearly that to me space flight is important in itself i say that space flight is the most

208
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:50,320
important thing and that is my philosophical position uh many people won't like that

209
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,560
from many comments that i've received many people actually don't like that

210
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:08,800
uh so that uh the book is mostly directed at space enthusiasts like me who do share

211
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:15,360
my philosophical convictions and i give them a lot of

212
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:26,480
practical arguments and consideration in support of space flight the support of human expansion

213
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:36,480
into space because i hope that they can use these arguments and considerations when talking to others

214
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:47,360
uh so i'm not credible too many because i am too much of a space enthusiast but perhaps some of my

215
00:31:47,360 --> 00:32:03,680
readers are for example uh you know there is some kind of uh tension between uh enthusiasm for space

216
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:14,400
enthusiasm for space and enthusiasm for things like protecting the environment from

217
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:23,360
climate change these are seen entirely entirely erroneously in my opinion as too conflicting

218
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:37,360
the goals on the contrary i offer some arguments to understand that these are not conflicting

219
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:48,800
goals but on the contrary they are complementary goals that reinforce each other and in particular

220
00:32:48,800 --> 00:33:01,280
no space expanding into space is really the only way to protect the environment of the earth

221
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:07,920
in the long term and here i'm talking of things like for example uh offshoring

222
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:18,080
some heavily polluting the heavy industry to space i'm talking of things like uh extracting the

223
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:25,120
energy from space and using it on the earth throughout uh the last few days there have been

224
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:36,080
for example uh papers about space-based solar power and this is another consideration if

225
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:44,480
is another consideration if we can extract energy up there and use it and use it down here that

226
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,480
means we don't have to extract the energy down here in the first place there is the possibility

227
00:33:50,480 --> 00:34:02,800
and that is specifically related to the moon that mining the moon for helium-3 could provide

228
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:11,680
inexhaustible reserves of fuels for future nuclear fusion reactors and in the last few days

229
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:19,680
interesting synchronicity we are also hearing a lot of the fact that nuclear fusion is becoming a

230
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:27,840
viable operational technology at the end you know these are so many things that are conspiring

231
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:38,560
to put it like that to make people understand that if we want to protect the environment

232
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:47,200
of the earth then we need to expand into space beyond the earth that will only be beneficial

233
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:55,200
for the planet so that this is an entire chapter of my book and it's something that you know if you

234
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:05,440
have some environmentalist friends of the people who are fans of uh Greta Thunberg for example

235
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:14,240
you can use these arguments to persuade them that space is good for the environment of the earth

236
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,800
and then they can use these arguments to persuade other people and so on

237
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:26,720
I think one of the problems that these um a lot of people do have to even begin to comprehend

238
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:34,160
the value and viability of the idea of space expansion goes back to inequality and class

239
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,720
issues here on earth because for a lot of people it's a matter of how they're going to survive the

240
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,560
next day and so even talking about this the space is kind of they take it as offensive because

241
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,280
they're like we don't even care you know we just want to survive and raise our family and so when

242
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,200
you're focusing on space it means that you're ignoring all the problems that we are dealing

243
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:59,440
with here on earth and so you know i'm being called the leftist for talking about inequality

244
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:06,480
and like for example i'm absolutely in favor of ubi uh in you know as at so i mean they're

245
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:12,720
inevitably you know we are dealing with explosion of technological tools because they're

246
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:19,360
advancing exponentially and our experience is linear but at the same time i understand if i

247
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:24,000
talk to somebody about space expansion that person look at me in a very strange way and like i just

248
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,360
want my kid to survive a school and i be able to pay my rent

249
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,120
and this is a point that i completely understand and here again

250
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:41,520
um i made that many considerations in the book to show that it is not so

251
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:51,440
uh expanding into space does not in the long term

252
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:59,840
take uh important resources away from important things that we should

253
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:08,960
do here on the earth on the contrary uh space expansion is an enabler for all these things

254
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,160
and you know uh an analogy

255
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:24,800
that could be done is uh what happened in the united states in the 19th century where uh

256
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:35,040
people started to move west no uh it's not like everyone was happy in new york it's not like

257
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:44,640
everyone had enough to eat in new york uh but and it was a very wise move the government decided to

258
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:50,480
encourage and they had to spend money on this of course they decided to spend money on the

259
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:56,960
encourage and they had to spend money on this of course they decided to encourage a mass

260
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:04,720
uh movement toward the west they did that with financial incentives and things like that

261
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:15,760
and you know that didn't directly change the condition of uh the poor people in new york

262
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:24,080
not uh directly and not immediately but eventually it did what happened eventually is that the

263
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:34,240
expansion of the united states toward the pacific ocean uh was one of the factors that made the

264
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:43,920
united states the most advanced economy in the world and you know there are still some uh

265
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:52,320
people who go hungry in new york today but i think we can agree that there are not as many

266
00:38:52,320 --> 00:39:05,680
as the people who went hungry uh 150 years ago so that ultimately the expansion of the habitat of the

267
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:16,160
of the u.s population that was only living on the east coast it has uh eventually resulted in

268
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:24,880
economic prosperity for everyone this is one example another example is much closer to us in time

269
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:37,680
in time and uh it is uh the development of internet technology that started in the 60s

270
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:47,920
with the financial support of the government then went kind of invisible for a couple of decades

271
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:55,680
and then started to explode in the early 80s a few years after that we started to see the

272
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:05,200
first mobile phones now uh perhaps you don't remember the first uh mobile phones oh i should have

273
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:15,280
taken one of my first mobile phones that i still have to show it on camera it was uh it was break

274
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:26,320
size yeah it was heavy as a brick i had to buy a special carrying case for it because of course

275
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:31,040
it didn't fit in my pocket and of course it costed a hell of a lot this was one year

276
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,960
this must have been a 90 this must have been like 94 95 something like that

277
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:48,160
and uh something that many people say is that well okay these things that you have to pay

278
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:56,000
two thousand dollars for a mobile phone is an insult to the poor and i can i can understand

279
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:04,240
if some people felt insulted seeing the others on the road with an expensive mobile phone

280
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:10,560
but what we used to say is that okay look we are at a very early stage of a new technology

281
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:19,920
what will happen because that's the evolution of important technologies that the price of these

282
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:27,520
things will go down and down and down and at the same time the performance of these things will go

283
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:35,680
up and this even if we cannot see exactly how right now will entirely change the world

284
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:41,040
in a couple of decades and that is exactly what happened because now a mobile phone doesn't cost

285
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:50,480
money i mean if you don't want to spend money the phone company will give you the mobile phone for

286
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:57,840
free if you have a contract with them and the performance of the phones you know is uh

287
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:09,200
is uh phenomenally better and it was uh 20 years ago and now i don't think i know anyone

288
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:18,800
doesn't have a mobile phone and at least if we stay in the western world this is also true in the

289
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:29,200
uh most under-privileged inner cities in the u.s and europe essentially everyone has a mobile phone

290
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:37,440
and uh the impact of everyone having a mobile phone is overall good

291
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:45,680
i'm persuaded of that and the same will happen with space now space flight cost a lot of money

292
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:54,960
and at times is difficult to see to see exactly uh why we are going to space and what we are

293
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:03,840
going to space for but just give time to time just wait for a few decades and it seems evident

294
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:12,320
from so many early warning signs that we can see right now that in a few decades you know it will be

295
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:23,440
it will be very evident inside why we decided to expand into outer space and it will be evident

296
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:33,680
that the overall impact on humanity will have been good i'm sure of that yeah um another example of

297
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:39,600
people being offended by expensive new technology was uh google glass that when it came out we

298
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:45,360
talked a lot about that in this podcast that when it came out people were being attacked who were

299
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:51,120
wearing them there were also an aspect of like an elitist aspect to it that you couldn't just go out

300
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:57,280
and buy it you had to be chosen and be given those devices and this is almost 10 years ago that people

301
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,240
were being attacked around silicon valley in san francisco all these big tech buses were being

302
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:09,360
attacked and now politically this is coming from the right there is a backlash against technology

303
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:14,240
altogether and there is a revival of traditionalism they're saying we have to go back to traditional

304
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:20,320
roots and they all seem to be connected in a sense that technology is evolving exponentially

305
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:26,080
and we we can't even comprehend it if we are not seeing the big picture and a lot of people not

306
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:33,040
only they get offended they get really scared and this being scared has real world political social

307
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:38,240
and cultural consequences that can affect what you're saying the advancement of technology is

308
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:44,160
not as fast as maybe we want it to be or as it needs to be in order for us to survive as a species

309
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:54,880
as a civilization i prefer to be optimist and the thing that even if things will be difficult

310
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:02,560
i prefer to hope that we will make it and even more important than that i prefer to do all the

311
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:12,960
little things that i can do to get closer to that objective but you know uh back to the tension

312
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:24,000
between uh technology and our cultural traditions i don't think that there has to be an opposition

313
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:33,840
i think we can uh advance technology even advance technology uh very fast

314
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:46,960
uh within our uh cultural traditions i mean it would be a long discussion but uh i'm not

315
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:53,920
i'm not immediately persuaded that it is not the case do you feel the same way about democracy as a

316
00:45:53,920 --> 00:46:01,600
system of governance because you mentioned china advancing really quickly it in a way is as a

317
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:08,080
consequence of a central structure of authority that they have and here in the u.s. all the places

318
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:13,680
basically that are developing and doing research about these technological advancements they are

319
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:19,840
being run as centralized uh points of authority centralized structures of authority like whether

320
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:32,960
it's darpa or a spacex or google i'm not um i'm not really fundamentalist in this i think there

321
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:45,440
is room for many different organizational models you know i do tend to have a slight preference

322
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:54,160
myself for decentralized models but if it happens that you know the weakest solution

323
00:46:54,160 --> 00:47:02,560
to an important problem can only come from a centralized structure then i would say why not

324
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:08,160
this is the same kind of reasoning that i was making before saying that you know

325
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:16,880
uh government support is still necessary for spaceflight and space expansion we cannot i mean

326
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:26,880
there is uh nothing bad in the idea of government itself does nothing bad about the idea of

327
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:33,440
government itself i guess it's just a form of government no yes it's the focus is a

328
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:42,320
is a management thing some organizational structure can be better than other

329
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:50,800
organizational structures for some specific purposes and that's it not really fundamentalist

330
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:56,880
here i welcome uh many different possibilities it just seems like the long-term big picture kind

331
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:03,360
of view is maybe incompatible with the system that people run on the basis of being elected

332
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:08,960
and then re-elected rather than being focused on some kind of an objective and determine policy

333
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:14,000
on that basis rather than you know determining policy based on the next century rather than the

334
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:22,000
next four years this is this is the reason i'm saying but right but yeah i understand this point

335
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:34,240
but um you know here again it comes down to whether we are intelligent and pragmatic enough

336
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:42,480
to work together with the people who do not think in exactly the same way as we do

337
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:52,480
and as a matter of fact you know uh reading the news now and especially through the social media

338
00:48:53,840 --> 00:49:01,840
you can develop the impression that you know people on the left will never accept

339
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:07,120
or to work together with people on the right and the other way but you know it hasn't always been

340
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:14,720
like that as a matter of fact this is quite a new development that has accelerated in the last few

341
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:24,800
years in the past it was a perfectly normal thing for example in the united states for uh

342
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:34,880
for uh democrats and republicans to push a bill that uh was good for both

343
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:49,280
um that were i mean this is really an important thing in fact uh you know um

344
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:58,880
um space flight the advancement of space flight needs bipartisan support

345
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,040
otherwise the rocket just doesn't take off

346
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:13,920
uh from the inception of a space uh program to its completion it does

347
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:23,120
take a long time it may be 10 it may be 15 years it may be decades and you know this can only be

348
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:31,280
compatible with uh a system like in the united states or many western democracies where the color

349
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:39,440
of the government changes every few years it can only be compatible with this if there is bipartisan

350
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:54,320
support and in fact i think this is uh if uh we keep talking of uh government space there has to be

351
00:50:54,320 --> 00:51:04,960
bipartisan support but since the government can also impact the space uh commercial space

352
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:13,920
could also impact the space uh commercial sector you know uh the government could kill

353
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:24,480
elon musk with over regulation anytime so that uh you know it's not only that we need bipartisan

354
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:34,800
support for government space program we need bipartisan support for space flight it's safe

355
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:42,080
even in the private sector especially in the united states in western europe and uh you know the

356
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:57,040
exhortation that um uh i give many time in this book is that you know uh politicians uh i'm not

357
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:02,640
going to read but i'm trying to quote from memory or something like that i say somewhere that

358
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:12,000
politicians of the left and politicians of the right should just uh uh let go of the

359
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:20,800
toxic aspects of their respective ideologies should just let go of their hatred for each other

360
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:30,880
and just sit the fuck down to define programs that uh everyone is willing to live with

361
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:39,040
for a while this is exactly what needs to happen in space in the west now in china they don't have

362
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:49,440
this problem or at least this problem is not apparent so that yes as you were saying uh china

363
00:52:49,440 --> 00:53:01,120
can think long term but this doesn't mean that we cannot think long term and you know uh the

364
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:13,360
chinese can think long term in their own way uh their way is not our way so we must learn to think

365
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:24,400
long term in our way and not ready to let democracy go you know uh when you first started talking

366
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:34,000
about democracy came to my mind my two favorite descriptions of democracy so the first i don't

367
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:45,360
know who said that first is that democracy are uh two uh wolves and the lamb deciding

368
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:51,280
democratically by majority vote what to have one of the founding fathers i don't exactly remember

369
00:53:51,280 --> 00:54:01,520
who but one of the founding fathers said it uh perhaps somebody important say that and uh the

370
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:09,840
uh the other and i think it was uh sir winston churchill who said it first is that democracy is

371
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:20,320
the worst system of uh government with the exception of all the other systems so that you

372
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:29,520
know even uh in view of the structural weakness of uh democracy that is quite evident in the story of

373
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:38,720
the two wolves and the lamb i still think democracy is better than the alternatives

374
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:45,920
that we have been trying so far so i just found that it was said by benjamin franklin democracy

375
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:51,600
is two wolves and lambs voting on what to have for lunch liberty is well armed lamb contesting the

376
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:59,440
vote i'm a big fan of the second amendment i think it's it's makes a very different uh

377
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:05,440
apparent different and very obvious different when um the populace are i didn't know i

378
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:14,400
i didn't know the second half of the citation yeah but what you're saying is totally sensible

379
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:19,600
because space flight and the space expansion is about humanity it's not about left and right

380
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:26,240
democrat and republican these are all blocks that we are passing through to get to the point of

381
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:34,400
of first surviving as one humanity and then expanding into you know we might be human plus

382
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:39,840
or whatever that comes next after humanity just that it seems like there is a battle right now

383
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:44,800
about what is the definition of humanity and therefore what is the goal of humanity that's

384
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:51,440
where we are it seems like it and i think you're a very um valuable kind of a perspective because

385
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:58,160
you're bringing spirituality and quote unquote god into it because that is the ultimate uh purpose

386
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:04,000
and ultimate ethos of what humanity as a collective regardless of whatever kind of ideology we have

387
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:12,480
can strive towards and can um can build towards that kind of an objective that is god-given for

388
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:23,200
lack of a better term right um we don't even have to use explicitly the term god i mean uh

389
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,560
you finished the book with some people won't yes yes yes i do

390
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:36,880
i finished the book with a quite um unconventional concept of god

391
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:44,800
unconventional in the sense that my god is not a supernatural god and uh i think the concept of

392
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:52,800
supernatural doesn't make any sense to me because if you define nature as all that exists then

393
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:58,960
supernatural doesn't exist by definition so everything is uh uh natural now of course

394
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:08,080
that we may have to expand your definition of uh nature to make room for things that do exist in

395
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:20,720
nature so uh there is an overall organizational principle in the universe that kind of uh pulls

396
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:30,320
the universe above toward the increasing levels of complexity and uh you know generates uh

397
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:37,600
intelligent life well first it generates non-intelligent life then it generates

398
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:44,960
intelligent life then it may generate one day super intelligent life and one aspect of this

399
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:54,720
uh principle of uh increasing complexity and penetration of consciousness and intelligence

400
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:02,480
in the whole universe one aspect of this is that we must go to space we must leave the earth we must

401
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:11,520
bring our dna our uh calcification of the universe we must go to space we must leave the earth

402
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:22,560
our dna our culture everywhere in the universe among the stars this is a

403
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:33,040
a universal principle that you don't have to call god but you can call god if you want

404
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:45,280
and uh i think this is what uh uh traditional religions refer

405
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:56,880
to in the most abstract parts of their theology then besides that you have the evolution of

406
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:03,680
evolution of super intelligent itself you know we will go to the stars we'll expand among the stars

407
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:14,880
and uh humanity itself uh uh will be changed we will uh edit our genome we will perhaps uh

408
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:23,040
upload our minds to uh computational systems much more powerful than a biological uh brain

409
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:34,880
we will do all these things and we will ascend toward god-like uh levels and conditions that uh

410
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:45,360
uh we probably are not even are not even able to imagine now and so many countless other alien

411
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:52,000
civilizations in the universe must have done exactly the same things and this is another reason

412
00:59:52,000 --> 01:00:03,600
why you must go to the stars to find uh teachers among the stars civilization much more advanced

413
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:14,240
than ours and uh one of the things that i have in the last chapter of my book that you were

414
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:24,480
referring to is a wonderful quote by Stanley Kubrick the director of 2001 space odyssey

415
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:33,360
where uh you know i don't remember to quote by heart but uh if you read the book just read it

416
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:42,480
is uh you know he's saying in very few words that out there in the universe there exist uh beings

417
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:50,000
uh so inconceivably advanced from our point of view that we can only call them gods

418
01:00:51,280 --> 01:01:00,320
whatever else would uh whatever other name will be a lack of honesty so there are uh gods out there

419
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:10,240
and this is another religious concept what um stanley cubrick did not say but his uh

420
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:18,960
collaborator Arthur C. Clarke uh did say that is that we ourselves if we are lucky and if we do

421
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:26,400
things well we ourselves may become a god-like civilization in the future

422
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:37,920
and that again is among the ultimate objectives of our quest to go to the stars we have to go to the

423
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:44,880
stars out there to do all that yeah and now there are philosophical and there i say religious

424
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:50,560
attempts are being made in order to create some kind of an ethos on the on this exact basis that

425
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:56,880
you're saying whether it's simulation hypothesis or theory or jason georgiani's prometheism

426
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:04,400
yeah these are all coming from traditional religions breaking the mold and moving towards

427
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:10,400
whatever that is coming next which i think they're very valuable yes in fact i've been

428
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:18,560
listening to your interviews with uh jason georgiani and your two separate interviews

429
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:29,440
with the recent work yes basically when ritz says that his version of the simulation hypothesis

430
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:38,800
is a necessary adaptation of the metaphors that the religion use to communicate to people

431
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:45,120
i think he's uh totally right one moment i think i need to put the power cable

432
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:50,320
here we go

433
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:57,120
amazing i had jason georgiani twice i don't know if you listen to both of them

434
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:06,480
uh no yeah i had them i'll look for them yeah the first one was when his prometheism book came out

435
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:14,880
maybe a few months ago and the second one was after that yeah after that he wrote a book uh called

436
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:21,920
closer encounters about ufos and this came out basically as a response to the government the

437
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:29,040
us government report on ufos oh i need to read i really like him i mean he's a very controversial

438
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:36,880
kind of a figure because of you know some of his views but uh i think he's extremely unique and he

439
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:43,200
dares going to places that you know not that many people i don't think you know can't even begin

440
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:52,400
you know can't even begin comprehending the possibility of them i like his book maybe i didn't

441
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:59,680
100 percent of it but i certainly did like a good 80 percent of it yeah excellent well this is a

442
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:04,080
pleasure that you've been listening to the interviews that i've done with them two of my

443
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:10,560
favorite guests definitely what are some of the characteristics of the ethos that you would

444
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:17,120
recommend for humanity to have in order to move uh to the point that we can decide as humanity

445
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:21,760
rather than left and right black and white you know democrat and republican and all that

446
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:28,480
is uh

447
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:42,080
uh i don't have a name for it the name that comes closer to my mind is cosmism is uh from

448
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:52,000
the russian cosmist philosophical movements that was uh that started in russia between the end of

449
01:04:52,000 --> 01:05:01,840
19th century and the beginning of the 20th century but uh you know they they used a language that

450
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:12,480
we find very much outdated now and if you read the writings of a russian cosmist philosopher

451
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:23,200
you wouldn't understand much and perhaps you wouldn't like what you read thinking of

452
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:27,040
more contemporary examples

453
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:31,040
because

454
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:47,280
talk of an excellent book written uh to me one moment i just need to tell my wife to

455
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,960
turn the water off yeah it was background noise

456
01:05:50,960 --> 01:06:00,080
uh there was there is an author called steven wolf who wrote a great book called the obligation

457
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:08,960
by the way if you never had steve on the podcast you should definitely on on the show you should

458
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:19,680
definitely have him it's a very short book and uh he says much better perhaps the same things

459
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:25,680
that i say that you know all the things that we have been discussing uh moving beyond the earth

460
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:32,880
leaving the solar system moving to other stars leaving the earth behind are our obligation

461
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:42,560
to ourselves our obligation to the earth itself our obligation to life our obligation to the

462
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:51,120
universe and even so steven doesn't uh use explicitly religious words our obligation to god

463
01:06:52,160 --> 01:07:03,680
now this is the ethos that i recommend which is basically a reformulation of the cosmist ethos

464
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:15,840
in a language that is more understandable to people here and now let's fill this obligation

465
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:25,440
that we have to ourselves into the universe around us to contribute to awaken the universe

466
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:35,600
to life consciousness super intelligence and perhaps god-like nature this is our obligation

467
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:43,040
this is what we are here for when uh earlier you said of course there are excuse me of course

468
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:48,160
there are other lives beyond earth on what basis do you say that on what kind of life

469
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:55,360
on what kind of life are you talking about conscious life or just like bacterial life or bacteria

470
01:07:55,360 --> 01:08:03,440
bacteria i guess it could be conscious too but you know what i mean bacterial life and animal life

471
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:10,960
and the human life life and conscious life and super conscious life there is room for all possible

472
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:20,400
uh source of life as a matter of fact i'm persuaded that no life is not an accident it's not uh the

473
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:28,320
result of uh excuse me one moment i have to pay my life again that uh she wants to cook dinner so

474
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:37,760
things just happened just yeah just a five uh just five more minutes after that

475
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:45,520
okay but this uh but this thing about life is important you know uh life is not a random

476
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:53,920
accidents that happened as a result of a random fluctuation that uh happened but could not

477
01:08:54,720 --> 01:09:05,120
have happened i have a completely different view i think that the very loss of fundamental physics

478
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:13,760
are wired to eventually reduce complexity life consciousness intelligence

479
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:22,400
super intelligence and godliness it could not have been another way it has to be this way

480
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:34,000
one consequence is that there is life everywhere it's not ruled out that we will find some

481
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,720
elementary examples of life here in the solar system for example there is a mission

482
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:47,760
planned to one of the ice moons in the outer solar system that may have an ocean

483
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:59,280
which may have more life we will find something in the solar system and when we eventually move out

484
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:08,080
to the stars we will find all sorts of life from simple life to societies like

485
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:17,680
our human civilization to inconceivably more advanced alien societies we will find all that

486
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:24,480
