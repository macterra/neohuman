00:00.000 --> 00:06.960
moving beyond the earth, leaving the solar system, moving to other stars, leaving the earth behind,

00:06.960 --> 00:15.760
are our obligations to ourselves, our obligations to the earth itself, our obligations to life,

00:16.720 --> 00:25.440
our obligations to the universe, and, even though Stephen doesn't use explicitly religious words,

00:25.440 --> 00:35.360
our obligation to God. Now, this is the ethos that I recommend, which is basically a reformulation

00:36.320 --> 00:45.040
of the Cosmic ethos in a language that is more understandable to people here and now.

00:45.040 --> 00:57.600
Julia Prisco, welcome back to New Human Podcast, this time the 98th episode, sir.

00:59.680 --> 01:04.480
Thank you very much for having me again. I enjoyed our last conversation last year.

01:04.480 --> 01:11.840
Yes, indeed. It was right after the first launch of astronauts with SpaceX reusable rocket,

01:11.840 --> 01:22.240
which I know you're very adamant in following what's going on with respect to space exploration

01:22.240 --> 01:28.000
and SpaceX and all that, and that was my second launch that I saw, and I recently just saw my

01:28.000 --> 01:33.200
fifth launch, which every single time it really is a spiritual experience, which again is good to

01:33.200 --> 01:37.760
talk to you because you're talking about science technology, but also about spirituality and

01:37.760 --> 01:47.040
religious aspect of what is going on in our civilization. So, congratulations for your new

01:47.040 --> 01:53.920
book, which is the main reason we're having this discussion. Future is Spaceflight Meditations,

01:53.920 --> 01:58.960
which came out recently, I believe, and it's available on Amazon and everywhere else. The

01:58.960 --> 02:03.680
digital and printed books are available. And audiobook, is it also available?

02:03.680 --> 02:12.960
Uh, no, no, not audio book yet. Um, so we're gonna, also because, uh, you know, I understand

02:12.960 --> 02:20.080
that many people like audio book, the things here. I like, I like, I love reading so very much

02:20.720 --> 02:27.760
that, you know, for me, uh, depriving myself of the pleasure of reading, uh, written words

02:27.760 --> 02:35.520
is unthinkable. And, uh, well, but I do know that many people like, uh, like audio books.

02:35.520 --> 02:42.960
Yeah. By the way, let me just get a copy. Great. I also show it, um, as we talk about it. Yeah,

02:42.960 --> 02:50.880
wonderful. And this is a follow-up. Would it be fair to say that this is a follow-up to your first

02:50.880 --> 03:00.880
book, Tales of the Touring Church? It's much less general. Uh, I would, uh, I prefer to say that it

03:00.880 --> 03:08.400
is a zoom on one, uh, chapter in Tales of the Touring Church, the chapter where I discuss

03:09.200 --> 03:15.840
space exploration. And since I believe, uh, that chapter is one of the most important in

03:15.840 --> 03:22.800
Tales of the Touring Church, I thought to expand it, uh, in a standalone book. We're definitely

03:22.800 --> 03:27.360
going to talk about it, but as I mentioned before we start recording, we'll go in public.

03:27.360 --> 03:32.640
I want to talk to you about a blog post that you had that, uh, the title is, I have resigned from

03:32.640 --> 03:39.680
the IEET board of directors. Would you mind if I read just the beginning of your post just so our

03:39.680 --> 03:51.600
audience can have some kind of a opinion? Um, uh, um, I was kind of hoping to avoid that, but anyway,

03:51.600 --> 03:57.520
let's go. Please do. I have resigned from the board of directors of the Institute for Ethics and

03:57.520 --> 04:04.000
Emerging Technologies, IEET. I have resigned in protest against a recent decision which hasn't

04:04.000 --> 04:09.840
been publicly announced yet. Like much of today's liberal left, the IEET has embraced certain

04:09.840 --> 04:15.760
currently fashionable by dangerously toxic trends, identity politics, Me Too, cancel culture. These

04:15.760 --> 04:21.920
trends start with good sentiments, but become toxic and dangerous when pushed to unreasonable

04:21.920 --> 04:27.920
and often ridiculous extremes. And the reason I wanted to start with this is because I believe

04:27.920 --> 04:35.120
that what's going on with respect to an underlaying of technological debate and developments that we

04:35.120 --> 04:42.160
are dealing with, there is a war of ethos. There is a war of philosophical aspect of what it is that

04:42.160 --> 04:45.840
we are doing, what is the purpose of it, where we are headed and why we are doing what we are

04:45.840 --> 04:54.000
doing. And so I think this is related because in many fields, especially AI ethics, this is

04:54.000 --> 05:01.840
almost entirely occupied by people who are coming from that political perspective, that

05:01.840 --> 05:06.640
philosophical perspective that you can call it far left, extreme left, whatever you want to call it,

05:06.640 --> 05:14.480
so liberal left as you're calling it. So I just want you to very generally talk a little about it

05:14.480 --> 05:21.920
before we get into your book, just so we know what was the problem with this organization, not exactly

05:21.920 --> 05:26.720
but just let's hear it from you.

05:29.200 --> 05:39.440
Okay, and as a matter of fact, I do discuss these things in the book as well. And my last book,

05:39.440 --> 05:47.840
Future is the Space Flight Meditation, is one of the very few writings in which I have gone

05:47.840 --> 05:56.800
into any kind of detail about what I think of what's happening in the world of politics

05:56.800 --> 06:04.960
and especially culture. I don't really like to discuss these things and in fact I almost never

06:04.960 --> 06:17.760
write about this for essentially two reasons. The first is that it's a complete waste of time

06:17.760 --> 06:30.160
because as things are today, you will not persuade anyone when discussing the politics and

06:30.160 --> 06:37.760
culture. Nobody will persuade you. What will happen instead is that you will start calling

06:37.760 --> 06:44.800
each other names and I just don't have the time for that. It's a complete waste of time. I prefer

06:44.800 --> 06:51.760
to dedicate my time to other things. But there is also another reason why I'm kind of reluctant

06:52.640 --> 07:01.920
to discuss these things and it is that, you know, the world in which we live today is so

07:05.120 --> 07:09.600
toxically polarized. For example, in the United States

07:09.600 --> 07:16.960
we have a situation where 40 percent of the people hate and are hated by the other 40 percent.

07:17.920 --> 07:25.440
It's a very heated situation. It's not good. It's not healthy. It's not something that can lead us

07:25.440 --> 07:37.920
anywhere good. So I kind of feel that my responsibility as a citizen is to stay in the

07:37.920 --> 07:48.960
is to stay away from this debate. I don't want to contribute to blowing on a fire

07:50.000 --> 07:59.360
that could become a very dangerous one so that I normally stay out of these things. In my writings

07:59.360 --> 08:06.240
I focus on other things. In my social media posts on Facebook and Twitter I also focus on other

08:06.240 --> 08:14.880
things. I almost entirely ignore politics just like every now and then because, you know, I think

08:14.880 --> 08:26.720
this is the responsible thing to do. Let's just talk of something else and let's just discuss

08:26.720 --> 08:37.920
something else. Now concerning this IEET episode, let's just say that there was a decision

08:39.920 --> 08:47.040
taken by a very narrow majority vote by the rest of the vote

08:47.040 --> 08:58.080
and I did not agree at all with this decision. My disagreement was so strong that I resigned

08:58.080 --> 09:04.320
from the board and I was kind of sad of doing that because, you know, I had been one of the

09:04.960 --> 09:10.560
co-founders of the Institute of Ethics and Emerging Technologies back in 2004

09:10.560 --> 09:18.480
and I was full of enthusiasm at that time because I thought the Institute would

09:19.280 --> 09:30.320
really amount to something one day but now that it has fallen to cancel culture I don't think

09:30.320 --> 09:39.040
it's likely to go anywhere and here again I have better things to do with my time and so I preferred

09:39.040 --> 09:50.400
to part ways as friendly as possible of course but I was just not interested in continuing to be part

09:51.520 --> 10:01.120
of that organization. Now coming to what exactly was the episode that

10:01.120 --> 10:11.920
prompted me to resign from the IEET. I'm not at liberty to say it and I'm not at liberty to say it

10:11.920 --> 10:26.320
because it was a discussion among the board of an organization and the discussion led to a decision

10:26.320 --> 10:35.840
that has never been communicated to the public as far as I am aware so that, you know, since

10:37.360 --> 10:48.480
it's not a public decision I'm not at liberty to comment on it. Now of course many people have

10:48.480 --> 11:00.880
guessed correctly exactly what decision I was talking about and let's just say that it's not

11:00.880 --> 11:08.480
that difficult to guess. Yeah I think a lot of us want to leave politicization alone just so we can

11:08.480 --> 11:14.080
do the stuff that we like but the problem is that the politicization by totalitarians is not leaving

11:14.080 --> 11:19.840
us alone, you know, to do whatever we want to do so everything is being politicized and I think it

11:19.840 --> 11:25.520
goes back to again a discussion that we had the first time that we talked about I think we

11:25.520 --> 11:30.080
disagreed with respect to for example Mormon Transhumanist Association that you said that

11:30.080 --> 11:39.680
it's actually a beneficial thing for religions to adopt into or religions to yeah adopt a modern

11:39.680 --> 11:45.840
technological kind of a framework within themselves and this seems to be to be the same thing that

11:46.400 --> 11:53.040
certain kind of people from certain political perspectives they are basically monopolizing

11:53.680 --> 12:00.000
on their ethos on their perspective and then using technology in order to empower that and this is

12:00.000 --> 12:04.560
affecting every single one of us ultimately that's that's one of the reasons that I wanted to start

12:04.560 --> 12:16.960
with this. I can agree with that and there's also another reason why one unfortunately cannot keep

12:16.960 --> 12:27.360
so far from politics as one would wish it is when you know the things that really interest you depend

12:27.360 --> 12:39.120
on political decisions that may or may not be made and this is exactly the case of space flight

12:39.120 --> 12:48.000
and this is the reason why I do discuss political and cultural issues in my book because you know

12:48.000 --> 13:01.920
it's very good that private space flight operators like Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos are doing all the

13:01.920 --> 13:13.200
wonderful things that they are doing but I'm not too optimistic when it comes to

13:13.200 --> 13:17.920
to their ability to do these things

13:20.240 --> 13:33.600
not only without government support but even in presence of some kind of opposition from the

13:33.600 --> 13:47.920
political world and this is a very likely a risk that we will be facing you are reading of course

13:47.920 --> 14:03.200
of this declaration that of influences that you know this space program of billionaires are not

14:03.200 --> 14:12.240
something good and this and that and blah blah and I think there is a very real danger that

14:12.240 --> 14:20.560
uh in countries like the United States the administration may become more and more hostile

14:21.760 --> 14:32.240
to private commercial space flight ventures and at the same time of course we cannot

14:33.680 --> 14:41.680
rely on the government alone to take us back to the moon and then beyond because you know

14:41.680 --> 14:47.200
we have been waiting for that for 50 years and that hasn't happened which means that this will

14:47.200 --> 14:58.880
not happen without some being uh changing factor like the advent of private space flight so I do

14:58.880 --> 15:10.800
not think that our expansion into space can proceed at this moment without at least some

15:10.800 --> 15:19.120
moderate support from the government and that means that unfortunately politics is still very

15:19.120 --> 15:31.440
much related to space flight and of course culture overall is also very much related to space flight

15:31.440 --> 15:39.520
and these are things that I could not ignore in a book dedicated to space flight as simple as that

15:39.520 --> 15:46.640
yeah absolutely do you see this competition and conflict that is going on between US and China

15:46.640 --> 15:53.760
help development of further and further technology that I would imagine that you're considering

15:53.760 --> 16:00.000
space exploration to be the objective and goal of all of these technological advancements that

16:00.000 --> 16:10.480
we're experiencing correct not only space exploration space expansion is not exploration

16:10.480 --> 16:18.000
for the sake of science it's much deeper than that it is that we need to expand our habitat

16:18.000 --> 16:32.000
our human habitat beyond uh this uh planet and uh you know is not exploring a mass to see what mass

16:32.000 --> 16:42.000
is like is like it's more uh settling mass to enable large numbers of people to eventually live

16:42.000 --> 16:51.520
there and then move beyond so yes space expansion is uh what I'm really interested in do you see the

16:51.520 --> 16:58.560
conflict between US and China helps this space expansion as a matter of um survival if not

16:58.560 --> 17:11.360
if not anything else yes it's uh it is really a matter of survival and uh you know helps uh uh it

17:11.360 --> 17:21.280
can help in uh two different ways one is that you know uh China will just go to the moon and

17:21.280 --> 17:29.520
will just colonize mass and uh this is the possibility that over the rest of this century

17:29.520 --> 17:39.760
it will be China that uh leads human expansion in the solar system if this happens I think this is

17:39.760 --> 17:49.280
good I mean what it's important for me is that humanity expands beyond the earth now whether

17:49.280 --> 18:00.000
that humanity is American humanity or Chinese humanity or African or whatever is a very secondary

18:00.000 --> 18:08.160
consideration to me the important thing is that we do it as human beings who does it first it's

18:08.160 --> 18:19.680
less important and this is one of the reasons why I'm a while uh I mean I'm not a fan of today's China

18:20.720 --> 18:27.360
on the contrary I am very critical of today's China because you know I keep reading about this

18:30.800 --> 18:34.560
how do they call it social control system something like that

18:34.560 --> 18:42.800
that they basically want social credit score what they basically want to achieve is a society

18:42.800 --> 18:53.040
where everyone is monitored from the cradle to the grave 24 seven every day by the government

18:55.360 --> 19:02.480
and of course they will be monitoring the compliance of the citizens to all that the

19:02.480 --> 19:10.400
Chinese communist party thinks is good and well I think this is no good I'm not a fan of that kind

19:10.400 --> 19:19.920
of social organization not at all but while I'm not a fan of the social organization system of

19:19.920 --> 19:34.400
today's China you know I am a fan of humanity moving to settle space so if it is inevitable

19:35.440 --> 19:44.480
that China takes the lead then I say okay why not welcome to China now of course for me

19:44.480 --> 19:55.280
uh this is a easier to say than for an American because I'm not an American so I have

20:01.200 --> 20:09.200
had and still have a great admiration for America I'm not a citizen I do not live in America so that

20:09.200 --> 20:18.560
you know if it's America or China if you ask me that okay well I would like to see a continued

20:18.560 --> 20:29.520
leadership of America but if it has to be China so be it but going back to America what I think

20:29.520 --> 20:41.280
is that at this moment the only thing that can revitalize the US space program and make sure

20:41.280 --> 20:52.880
that it stays vital is competition with China uh this example competition is good if there is

20:52.880 --> 21:05.120
an immediate and credible threat that China could be about to achieve space supremacy in the

21:05.120 --> 21:14.080
cislunar space and of course convert that space supremacy into geopolitical and even military

21:14.080 --> 21:23.600
advantage here on the earth that I think would be something that no American administration regardless

21:24.480 --> 21:36.560
of its political color could ever afford to ignore and I think that is happening now

21:36.560 --> 21:47.120
and I think it is good I mean without uh China I'm not very optimistic about the US administration

21:47.760 --> 21:56.400
to give any damn about space with China they have to yeah that's a very good point space maximalism

21:56.400 --> 22:02.880
basically now whatever is going to happen is going to happen for as long as we get to where we are

22:02.880 --> 22:10.080
supposed to be getting which is popularizing the solar system first and then beyond with humanity

22:11.920 --> 22:18.480
yes I think this is a good time to read the beginning of your book and then get some

22:19.360 --> 22:25.520
ideas from you that why this was right now was the right time to write and publish this book

22:25.520 --> 22:32.960
you're saying in the introduction we must strenuously push toward our cosmic destiny among

22:32.960 --> 22:40.160
the stars beginning to expand beyond the earth before it's too late is our most important task

22:40.160 --> 22:45.600
at this moment in history many actors have important roles to play and there's room for

22:45.600 --> 22:52.160
everyone space flight will also help find viable solutions for current developmental environmental

22:52.160 --> 22:59.440
and social problems but the road to the stars is full of impediments and roadblocks we will not

22:59.440 --> 23:06.640
advance as fast as we wish therefore we must keep our moods strenuous and our drive strong we need

23:06.640 --> 23:13.360
an optimistic space flight culture oriented to the future with energizing visions of interplanetary

23:13.360 --> 23:19.760
interstellar and cosmic futures we also need a futurist space philosophy which I totally agree

23:19.760 --> 23:26.880
and that's exactly why I said that this war over the ethos that is now being politicized is essential

23:26.880 --> 23:30.960
with respect to our technological advancement and space expansion

23:33.920 --> 23:42.000
well you have read the first two paragraphs of the book and after that perhaps there is no need

23:42.000 --> 23:51.920
that you read the rest of the book because what I wanted is to say in these very short paragraphs

23:51.920 --> 23:58.720
exactly what the book was about but no I'm joking I think that's the thesis that is the thesis of

23:58.720 --> 24:08.000
your very other right right right yes I'm saying the most important things here at first

24:08.000 --> 24:17.680
that you know moving beyond the earth leaving all over the solar system one day

24:18.560 --> 24:27.600
leaving even the solar system beyond and moving to other stars is you know it is the most important

24:27.600 --> 24:34.480
thing because it's what we have to do it's built in our genes that's what humans do

24:34.480 --> 24:44.640
and it's also kind of an obligation to the earth to life and to the very universe an obligation that

24:44.640 --> 24:53.040
we have to bring life out there of course there is other life out there but we have something to add

24:53.040 --> 25:05.200
but we have something to add and adding this something that we can add is an existential

25:05.200 --> 25:16.240
imperative for humanity so this is my consideration number one now it's a philosophical position

25:16.240 --> 25:27.840
and I cannot expect everyone else to automatically agree with my philosophical position if I don't

25:27.840 --> 25:38.480
persuade them first and persuading them has to be based on arguments that they can accept

25:38.480 --> 25:50.000
that they can accept that's why I dedicate a big part of the book to describe some

25:51.040 --> 25:59.920
practical benefits in terms of economy in terms of national security in terms of environmental

25:59.920 --> 26:12.720
protection social justice that space flight will bring I tried to persuade those who do not

26:13.360 --> 26:20.160
immediately relate to my overall philosophical position that we must

26:21.280 --> 26:26.320
expand into space because we must expand into space because it's our cosmic destiny

26:26.320 --> 26:34.800
so this was the second important thing the third important thing is a reflection on the history

26:34.800 --> 26:44.320
of the last few decades you know where you are younger than me a little bit and yeah you are not

26:44.320 --> 26:55.360
on July 20 1969 you are not even alive I was I was 11 years old and I was watching this extreme

26:55.360 --> 27:05.600
extremely bad quality video image on a black and white tv and it was like oh this is our future

27:05.600 --> 27:13.680
and this is my future I was a kid I thought that when I turned 25 or 30 there would be a city on

27:13.680 --> 27:19.840
the moon where I could move to this is where we landed on I'm just saying for people who don't know

27:19.840 --> 27:29.600
yes yeah yeah we had so many great expectations all the hits of my generation and we have been

27:29.600 --> 27:39.760
frustrated because after 1972 we have never been back to the moon now we might be back to the moon

27:41.520 --> 27:49.440
before the end of this decade perhaps I'm not even 100% sure of that so maybe things are moving

27:49.440 --> 27:58.000
again but one thing is true is that it has taken a lot more than we thought and things will continue

27:58.000 --> 28:11.920
to be that way I mean is inevitable then in a complex world with technology finance politics

28:11.920 --> 28:18.480
and culture and all that we will not advance as fast as we would like to advance on the road to

28:18.480 --> 28:28.000
the stars but we need to keep our enthusiasm alive and here is where I come to the paramount

28:28.000 --> 28:42.320
importance of cultural factors we need to uh engineer cultural factors that uh permit

28:42.320 --> 28:51.760
a sustainable space program over the next few decades regardless of the roadblocks and

28:51.760 --> 28:59.520
difficulties and lack of money and political opposition that we will inevitably encounter

29:00.800 --> 29:02.640
this is the importance of

29:05.360 --> 29:11.920
popularizing space this is the importance of good science fiction this is the importance of new

29:11.920 --> 29:19.440
spiritual movements related to the space expansion of humanity these things are extremely important

29:20.560 --> 29:28.800
and uh this is uh what my own work is mostly related to

29:30.960 --> 29:35.280
you had mentioned in the book that you start writing it right after the first launch of

29:35.280 --> 29:43.440
astronauts by space x reusable rocket right what made you think that this is the right time

29:43.440 --> 29:47.920
to write this book and who exactly are you talking to is the general public or is this

29:47.920 --> 29:54.560
a specific group of um people with influence and power what was the what was the objective

29:54.560 --> 30:07.440
and what inspired it when it did uh you know if the those in the general public want to read my

30:07.440 --> 30:19.520
book i can only be happy of that at the same time i understand that those who do not already agree

30:19.520 --> 30:31.840
with me on most things may find it difficult to relate personally to my book because i say

30:32.480 --> 30:43.200
very clearly that to me space flight is important in itself i say that space flight is the most

30:43.200 --> 30:50.320
important thing and that is my philosophical position uh many people won't like that

30:51.520 --> 30:56.560
from many comments that i've received many people actually don't like that

30:58.320 --> 31:08.800
uh so that uh the book is mostly directed at space enthusiasts like me who do share

31:08.800 --> 31:15.360
my philosophical convictions and i give them a lot of

31:17.600 --> 31:26.480
practical arguments and consideration in support of space flight the support of human expansion

31:26.480 --> 31:36.480
into space because i hope that they can use these arguments and considerations when talking to others

31:36.480 --> 31:47.360
uh so i'm not credible too many because i am too much of a space enthusiast but perhaps some of my

31:47.360 --> 32:03.680
readers are for example uh you know there is some kind of uh tension between uh enthusiasm for space

32:03.680 --> 32:14.400
enthusiasm for space and enthusiasm for things like protecting the environment from

32:15.280 --> 32:23.360
climate change these are seen entirely entirely erroneously in my opinion as too conflicting

32:23.360 --> 32:37.360
the goals on the contrary i offer some arguments to understand that these are not conflicting

32:37.920 --> 32:48.800
goals but on the contrary they are complementary goals that reinforce each other and in particular

32:48.800 --> 33:01.280
no space expanding into space is really the only way to protect the environment of the earth

33:01.280 --> 33:07.920
in the long term and here i'm talking of things like for example uh offshoring

33:07.920 --> 33:18.080
some heavily polluting the heavy industry to space i'm talking of things like uh extracting the

33:18.080 --> 33:25.120
energy from space and using it on the earth throughout uh the last few days there have been

33:25.120 --> 33:36.080
for example uh papers about space-based solar power and this is another consideration if

33:36.080 --> 33:44.480
is another consideration if we can extract energy up there and use it and use it down here that

33:44.480 --> 33:50.480
means we don't have to extract the energy down here in the first place there is the possibility

33:50.480 --> 34:02.800
and that is specifically related to the moon that mining the moon for helium-3 could provide

34:02.800 --> 34:11.680
inexhaustible reserves of fuels for future nuclear fusion reactors and in the last few days

34:12.320 --> 34:19.680
interesting synchronicity we are also hearing a lot of the fact that nuclear fusion is becoming a

34:19.680 --> 34:27.840
viable operational technology at the end you know these are so many things that are conspiring

34:27.840 --> 34:38.560
to put it like that to make people understand that if we want to protect the environment

34:38.560 --> 34:47.200
of the earth then we need to expand into space beyond the earth that will only be beneficial

34:47.200 --> 34:55.200
for the planet so that this is an entire chapter of my book and it's something that you know if you

34:55.200 --> 35:05.440
have some environmentalist friends of the people who are fans of uh Greta Thunberg for example

35:06.000 --> 35:14.240
you can use these arguments to persuade them that space is good for the environment of the earth

35:14.240 --> 35:18.800
and then they can use these arguments to persuade other people and so on

35:18.800 --> 35:26.720
I think one of the problems that these um a lot of people do have to even begin to comprehend

35:26.720 --> 35:34.160
the value and viability of the idea of space expansion goes back to inequality and class

35:34.160 --> 35:38.720
issues here on earth because for a lot of people it's a matter of how they're going to survive the

35:38.720 --> 35:44.560
next day and so even talking about this the space is kind of they take it as offensive because

35:44.560 --> 35:49.280
they're like we don't even care you know we just want to survive and raise our family and so when

35:49.280 --> 35:53.200
you're focusing on space it means that you're ignoring all the problems that we are dealing

35:53.200 --> 35:59.440
with here on earth and so you know i'm being called the leftist for talking about inequality

35:59.440 --> 36:06.480
and like for example i'm absolutely in favor of ubi uh in you know as at so i mean they're

36:06.480 --> 36:12.720
inevitably you know we are dealing with explosion of technological tools because they're

36:12.720 --> 36:19.360
advancing exponentially and our experience is linear but at the same time i understand if i

36:19.360 --> 36:24.000
talk to somebody about space expansion that person look at me in a very strange way and like i just

36:24.000 --> 36:27.360
want my kid to survive a school and i be able to pay my rent

36:30.480 --> 36:35.120
and this is a point that i completely understand and here again

36:35.120 --> 36:41.520
um i made that many considerations in the book to show that it is not so

36:44.320 --> 36:51.440
uh expanding into space does not in the long term

36:53.360 --> 36:59.840
take uh important resources away from important things that we should

36:59.840 --> 37:08.960
do here on the earth on the contrary uh space expansion is an enabler for all these things

37:09.680 --> 37:12.160
and you know uh an analogy

37:15.040 --> 37:24.800
that could be done is uh what happened in the united states in the 19th century where uh

37:24.800 --> 37:35.040
people started to move west no uh it's not like everyone was happy in new york it's not like

37:35.040 --> 37:44.640
everyone had enough to eat in new york uh but and it was a very wise move the government decided to

37:44.640 --> 37:50.480
encourage and they had to spend money on this of course they decided to spend money on the

37:50.480 --> 37:56.960
encourage and they had to spend money on this of course they decided to encourage a mass

37:57.760 --> 38:04.720
uh movement toward the west they did that with financial incentives and things like that

38:06.080 --> 38:15.760
and you know that didn't directly change the condition of uh the poor people in new york

38:15.760 --> 38:24.080
not uh directly and not immediately but eventually it did what happened eventually is that the

38:24.080 --> 38:34.240
expansion of the united states toward the pacific ocean uh was one of the factors that made the

38:34.240 --> 38:43.920
united states the most advanced economy in the world and you know there are still some uh

38:43.920 --> 38:52.320
people who go hungry in new york today but i think we can agree that there are not as many

38:52.320 --> 39:05.680
as the people who went hungry uh 150 years ago so that ultimately the expansion of the habitat of the

39:05.680 --> 39:16.160
of the u.s population that was only living on the east coast it has uh eventually resulted in

39:16.160 --> 39:24.880
economic prosperity for everyone this is one example another example is much closer to us in time

39:24.880 --> 39:37.680
in time and uh it is uh the development of internet technology that started in the 60s

39:38.320 --> 39:47.920
with the financial support of the government then went kind of invisible for a couple of decades

39:47.920 --> 39:55.680
and then started to explode in the early 80s a few years after that we started to see the

39:55.680 --> 40:05.200
first mobile phones now uh perhaps you don't remember the first uh mobile phones oh i should have

40:08.640 --> 40:15.280
taken one of my first mobile phones that i still have to show it on camera it was uh it was break

40:15.280 --> 40:26.320
size yeah it was heavy as a brick i had to buy a special carrying case for it because of course

40:26.320 --> 40:31.040
it didn't fit in my pocket and of course it costed a hell of a lot this was one year

40:34.000 --> 40:40.960
this must have been a 90 this must have been like 94 95 something like that

40:40.960 --> 40:48.160
and uh something that many people say is that well okay these things that you have to pay

40:48.160 --> 40:56.000
two thousand dollars for a mobile phone is an insult to the poor and i can i can understand

40:56.800 --> 41:04.240
if some people felt insulted seeing the others on the road with an expensive mobile phone

41:04.240 --> 41:10.560
but what we used to say is that okay look we are at a very early stage of a new technology

41:10.560 --> 41:19.920
what will happen because that's the evolution of important technologies that the price of these

41:19.920 --> 41:27.520
things will go down and down and down and at the same time the performance of these things will go

41:27.520 --> 41:35.680
up and this even if we cannot see exactly how right now will entirely change the world

41:35.680 --> 41:41.040
in a couple of decades and that is exactly what happened because now a mobile phone doesn't cost

41:41.040 --> 41:50.480
money i mean if you don't want to spend money the phone company will give you the mobile phone for

41:50.480 --> 41:57.840
free if you have a contract with them and the performance of the phones you know is uh

41:57.840 --> 42:09.200
is uh phenomenally better and it was uh 20 years ago and now i don't think i know anyone

42:09.200 --> 42:18.800
doesn't have a mobile phone and at least if we stay in the western world this is also true in the

42:18.800 --> 42:29.200
uh most under-privileged inner cities in the u.s and europe essentially everyone has a mobile phone

42:30.240 --> 42:37.440
and uh the impact of everyone having a mobile phone is overall good

42:38.960 --> 42:45.680
i'm persuaded of that and the same will happen with space now space flight cost a lot of money

42:45.680 --> 42:54.960
and at times is difficult to see to see exactly uh why we are going to space and what we are

42:54.960 --> 43:03.840
going to space for but just give time to time just wait for a few decades and it seems evident

43:03.840 --> 43:12.320
from so many early warning signs that we can see right now that in a few decades you know it will be

43:12.320 --> 43:23.440
it will be very evident inside why we decided to expand into outer space and it will be evident

43:24.000 --> 43:33.680
that the overall impact on humanity will have been good i'm sure of that yeah um another example of

43:33.680 --> 43:39.600
people being offended by expensive new technology was uh google glass that when it came out we

43:39.600 --> 43:45.360
talked a lot about that in this podcast that when it came out people were being attacked who were

43:45.360 --> 43:51.120
wearing them there were also an aspect of like an elitist aspect to it that you couldn't just go out

43:51.120 --> 43:57.280
and buy it you had to be chosen and be given those devices and this is almost 10 years ago that people

43:57.280 --> 44:02.240
were being attacked around silicon valley in san francisco all these big tech buses were being

44:02.240 --> 44:09.360
attacked and now politically this is coming from the right there is a backlash against technology

44:09.360 --> 44:14.240
altogether and there is a revival of traditionalism they're saying we have to go back to traditional

44:14.240 --> 44:20.320
roots and they all seem to be connected in a sense that technology is evolving exponentially

44:20.320 --> 44:26.080
and we we can't even comprehend it if we are not seeing the big picture and a lot of people not

44:26.080 --> 44:33.040
only they get offended they get really scared and this being scared has real world political social

44:33.040 --> 44:38.240
and cultural consequences that can affect what you're saying the advancement of technology is

44:38.240 --> 44:44.160
not as fast as maybe we want it to be or as it needs to be in order for us to survive as a species

44:44.160 --> 44:54.880
as a civilization i prefer to be optimist and the thing that even if things will be difficult

44:54.880 --> 45:02.560
i prefer to hope that we will make it and even more important than that i prefer to do all the

45:02.560 --> 45:12.960
little things that i can do to get closer to that objective but you know uh back to the tension

45:12.960 --> 45:24.000
between uh technology and our cultural traditions i don't think that there has to be an opposition

45:24.000 --> 45:33.840
i think we can uh advance technology even advance technology uh very fast

45:37.360 --> 45:46.960
uh within our uh cultural traditions i mean it would be a long discussion but uh i'm not

45:46.960 --> 45:53.920
i'm not immediately persuaded that it is not the case do you feel the same way about democracy as a

45:53.920 --> 46:01.600
system of governance because you mentioned china advancing really quickly it in a way is as a

46:01.600 --> 46:08.080
consequence of a central structure of authority that they have and here in the u.s. all the places

46:08.080 --> 46:13.680
basically that are developing and doing research about these technological advancements they are

46:13.680 --> 46:19.840
being run as centralized uh points of authority centralized structures of authority like whether

46:19.840 --> 46:32.960
it's darpa or a spacex or google i'm not um i'm not really fundamentalist in this i think there

46:32.960 --> 46:45.440
is room for many different organizational models you know i do tend to have a slight preference

46:45.440 --> 46:54.160
myself for decentralized models but if it happens that you know the weakest solution

46:54.160 --> 47:02.560
to an important problem can only come from a centralized structure then i would say why not

47:02.560 --> 47:08.160
this is the same kind of reasoning that i was making before saying that you know

47:08.160 --> 47:16.880
uh government support is still necessary for spaceflight and space expansion we cannot i mean

47:16.880 --> 47:26.880
there is uh nothing bad in the idea of government itself does nothing bad about the idea of

47:26.880 --> 47:33.440
government itself i guess it's just a form of government no yes it's the focus is a

47:35.360 --> 47:42.320
is a management thing some organizational structure can be better than other

47:42.320 --> 47:50.800
organizational structures for some specific purposes and that's it not really fundamentalist

47:50.800 --> 47:56.880
here i welcome uh many different possibilities it just seems like the long-term big picture kind

47:56.880 --> 48:03.360
of view is maybe incompatible with the system that people run on the basis of being elected

48:03.360 --> 48:08.960
and then re-elected rather than being focused on some kind of an objective and determine policy

48:08.960 --> 48:14.000
on that basis rather than you know determining policy based on the next century rather than the

48:14.000 --> 48:22.000
next four years this is this is the reason i'm saying but right but yeah i understand this point

48:22.000 --> 48:34.240
but um you know here again it comes down to whether we are intelligent and pragmatic enough

48:34.240 --> 48:42.480
to work together with the people who do not think in exactly the same way as we do

48:44.080 --> 48:52.480
and as a matter of fact you know uh reading the news now and especially through the social media

48:53.840 --> 49:01.840
you can develop the impression that you know people on the left will never accept

49:01.840 --> 49:07.120
or to work together with people on the right and the other way but you know it hasn't always been

49:07.120 --> 49:14.720
like that as a matter of fact this is quite a new development that has accelerated in the last few

49:14.720 --> 49:24.800
years in the past it was a perfectly normal thing for example in the united states for uh

49:24.800 --> 49:34.880
for uh democrats and republicans to push a bill that uh was good for both

49:38.720 --> 49:49.280
um that were i mean this is really an important thing in fact uh you know um

49:49.280 --> 49:58.880
um space flight the advancement of space flight needs bipartisan support

50:00.080 --> 50:03.040
otherwise the rocket just doesn't take off

50:05.600 --> 50:13.920
uh from the inception of a space uh program to its completion it does

50:13.920 --> 50:23.120
take a long time it may be 10 it may be 15 years it may be decades and you know this can only be

50:23.120 --> 50:31.280
compatible with uh a system like in the united states or many western democracies where the color

50:31.280 --> 50:39.440
of the government changes every few years it can only be compatible with this if there is bipartisan

50:39.440 --> 50:54.320
support and in fact i think this is uh if uh we keep talking of uh government space there has to be

50:54.320 --> 51:04.960
bipartisan support but since the government can also impact the space uh commercial space

51:04.960 --> 51:13.920
could also impact the space uh commercial sector you know uh the government could kill

51:14.800 --> 51:24.480
elon musk with over regulation anytime so that uh you know it's not only that we need bipartisan

51:24.480 --> 51:34.800
support for government space program we need bipartisan support for space flight it's safe

51:34.800 --> 51:42.080
even in the private sector especially in the united states in western europe and uh you know the

51:43.040 --> 51:57.040
exhortation that um uh i give many time in this book is that you know uh politicians uh i'm not

51:57.040 --> 52:02.640
going to read but i'm trying to quote from memory or something like that i say somewhere that

52:02.640 --> 52:12.000
politicians of the left and politicians of the right should just uh uh let go of the

52:13.280 --> 52:20.800
toxic aspects of their respective ideologies should just let go of their hatred for each other

52:21.360 --> 52:30.880
and just sit the fuck down to define programs that uh everyone is willing to live with

52:30.880 --> 52:39.040
for a while this is exactly what needs to happen in space in the west now in china they don't have

52:39.040 --> 52:49.440
this problem or at least this problem is not apparent so that yes as you were saying uh china

52:49.440 --> 53:01.120
can think long term but this doesn't mean that we cannot think long term and you know uh the

53:01.120 --> 53:13.360
chinese can think long term in their own way uh their way is not our way so we must learn to think

53:13.360 --> 53:24.400
long term in our way and not ready to let democracy go you know uh when you first started talking

53:24.400 --> 53:34.000
about democracy came to my mind my two favorite descriptions of democracy so the first i don't

53:34.000 --> 53:45.360
know who said that first is that democracy are uh two uh wolves and the lamb deciding

53:45.360 --> 53:51.280
democratically by majority vote what to have one of the founding fathers i don't exactly remember

53:51.280 --> 54:01.520
who but one of the founding fathers said it uh perhaps somebody important say that and uh the

54:01.520 --> 54:09.840
uh the other and i think it was uh sir winston churchill who said it first is that democracy is

54:09.840 --> 54:20.320
the worst system of uh government with the exception of all the other systems so that you

54:20.320 --> 54:29.520
know even uh in view of the structural weakness of uh democracy that is quite evident in the story of

54:29.520 --> 54:38.720
the two wolves and the lamb i still think democracy is better than the alternatives

54:38.720 --> 54:45.920
that we have been trying so far so i just found that it was said by benjamin franklin democracy

54:45.920 --> 54:51.600
is two wolves and lambs voting on what to have for lunch liberty is well armed lamb contesting the

54:51.600 --> 54:59.440
vote i'm a big fan of the second amendment i think it's it's makes a very different uh

54:59.440 --> 55:05.440
apparent different and very obvious different when um the populace are i didn't know i

55:07.520 --> 55:14.400
i didn't know the second half of the citation yeah but what you're saying is totally sensible

55:14.400 --> 55:19.600
because space flight and the space expansion is about humanity it's not about left and right

55:19.600 --> 55:26.240
democrat and republican these are all blocks that we are passing through to get to the point of

55:26.240 --> 55:34.400
of first surviving as one humanity and then expanding into you know we might be human plus

55:34.960 --> 55:39.840
or whatever that comes next after humanity just that it seems like there is a battle right now

55:39.840 --> 55:44.800
about what is the definition of humanity and therefore what is the goal of humanity that's

55:44.800 --> 55:51.440
where we are it seems like it and i think you're a very um valuable kind of a perspective because

55:51.440 --> 55:58.160
you're bringing spirituality and quote unquote god into it because that is the ultimate uh purpose

55:58.160 --> 56:04.000
and ultimate ethos of what humanity as a collective regardless of whatever kind of ideology we have

56:04.000 --> 56:12.480
can strive towards and can um can build towards that kind of an objective that is god-given for

56:12.480 --> 56:23.200
lack of a better term right um we don't even have to use explicitly the term god i mean uh

56:23.920 --> 56:28.560
you finished the book with some people won't yes yes yes i do

56:30.640 --> 56:36.880
i finished the book with a quite um unconventional concept of god

56:36.880 --> 56:44.800
unconventional in the sense that my god is not a supernatural god and uh i think the concept of

56:44.800 --> 56:52.800
supernatural doesn't make any sense to me because if you define nature as all that exists then

56:52.800 --> 56:58.960
supernatural doesn't exist by definition so everything is uh uh natural now of course

56:58.960 --> 57:08.080
that we may have to expand your definition of uh nature to make room for things that do exist in

57:08.080 --> 57:20.720
nature so uh there is an overall organizational principle in the universe that kind of uh pulls

57:20.720 --> 57:30.320
the universe above toward the increasing levels of complexity and uh you know generates uh

57:31.360 --> 57:37.600
intelligent life well first it generates non-intelligent life then it generates

57:37.600 --> 57:44.960
intelligent life then it may generate one day super intelligent life and one aspect of this

57:44.960 --> 57:54.720
uh principle of uh increasing complexity and penetration of consciousness and intelligence

57:55.280 --> 58:02.480
in the whole universe one aspect of this is that we must go to space we must leave the earth we must

58:03.280 --> 58:11.520
bring our dna our uh calcification of the universe we must go to space we must leave the earth

58:11.520 --> 58:22.560
our dna our culture everywhere in the universe among the stars this is a

58:24.560 --> 58:33.040
a universal principle that you don't have to call god but you can call god if you want

58:33.040 --> 58:45.280
and uh i think this is what uh uh traditional religions refer

58:47.280 --> 58:56.880
to in the most abstract parts of their theology then besides that you have the evolution of

58:56.880 --> 59:03.680
evolution of super intelligent itself you know we will go to the stars we'll expand among the stars

59:04.640 --> 59:14.880
and uh humanity itself uh uh will be changed we will uh edit our genome we will perhaps uh

59:14.880 --> 59:23.040
upload our minds to uh computational systems much more powerful than a biological uh brain

59:23.040 --> 59:34.880
we will do all these things and we will ascend toward god-like uh levels and conditions that uh

59:36.400 --> 59:45.360
uh we probably are not even are not even able to imagine now and so many countless other alien

59:45.840 --> 59:52.000
civilizations in the universe must have done exactly the same things and this is another reason

59:52.000 --> 01:00:03.600
why you must go to the stars to find uh teachers among the stars civilization much more advanced

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:14.240
than ours and uh one of the things that i have in the last chapter of my book that you were

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:24.480
referring to is a wonderful quote by Stanley Kubrick the director of 2001 space odyssey

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:33.360
where uh you know i don't remember to quote by heart but uh if you read the book just read it

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:42.480
is uh you know he's saying in very few words that out there in the universe there exist uh beings

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:50.000
uh so inconceivably advanced from our point of view that we can only call them gods

01:00:51.280 --> 01:01:00.320
whatever else would uh whatever other name will be a lack of honesty so there are uh gods out there

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:10.240
and this is another religious concept what um stanley cubrick did not say but his uh

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:18.960
collaborator Arthur C. Clarke uh did say that is that we ourselves if we are lucky and if we do

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:26.400
things well we ourselves may become a god-like civilization in the future

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:37.920
and that again is among the ultimate objectives of our quest to go to the stars we have to go to the

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:44.880
stars out there to do all that yeah and now there are philosophical and there i say religious

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:50.560
attempts are being made in order to create some kind of an ethos on the on this exact basis that

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:56.880
you're saying whether it's simulation hypothesis or theory or jason georgiani's prometheism

01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:04.400
yeah these are all coming from traditional religions breaking the mold and moving towards

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:10.400
whatever that is coming next which i think they're very valuable yes in fact i've been

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:18.560
listening to your interviews with uh jason georgiani and your two separate interviews

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:29.440
with the recent work yes basically when ritz says that his version of the simulation hypothesis

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:38.800
is a necessary adaptation of the metaphors that the religion use to communicate to people

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:45.120
i think he's uh totally right one moment i think i need to put the power cable

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:50.320
here we go

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:57.120
amazing i had jason georgiani twice i don't know if you listen to both of them

01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:06.480
uh no yeah i had them i'll look for them yeah the first one was when his prometheism book came out

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:14.880
maybe a few months ago and the second one was after that yeah after that he wrote a book uh called

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:21.920
closer encounters about ufos and this came out basically as a response to the government the

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:29.040
us government report on ufos oh i need to read i really like him i mean he's a very controversial

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:36.880
kind of a figure because of you know some of his views but uh i think he's extremely unique and he

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:43.200
dares going to places that you know not that many people i don't think you know can't even begin

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:52.400
you know can't even begin comprehending the possibility of them i like his book maybe i didn't

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:59.680
100 percent of it but i certainly did like a good 80 percent of it yeah excellent well this is a

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:04.080
pleasure that you've been listening to the interviews that i've done with them two of my

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:10.560
favorite guests definitely what are some of the characteristics of the ethos that you would

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:17.120
recommend for humanity to have in order to move uh to the point that we can decide as humanity

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:21.760
rather than left and right black and white you know democrat and republican and all that

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:28.480
is uh

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:42.080
uh i don't have a name for it the name that comes closer to my mind is cosmism is uh from

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:52.000
the russian cosmist philosophical movements that was uh that started in russia between the end of

01:04:52.000 --> 01:05:01.840
19th century and the beginning of the 20th century but uh you know they they used a language that

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:12.480
we find very much outdated now and if you read the writings of a russian cosmist philosopher

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:23.200
you wouldn't understand much and perhaps you wouldn't like what you read thinking of

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:27.040
more contemporary examples

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:31.040
because

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:47.280
talk of an excellent book written uh to me one moment i just need to tell my wife to

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.960
turn the water off yeah it was background noise

01:05:50.960 --> 01:06:00.080
uh there was there is an author called steven wolf who wrote a great book called the obligation

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:08.960
by the way if you never had steve on the podcast you should definitely on on the show you should

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:19.680
definitely have him it's a very short book and uh he says much better perhaps the same things

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:25.680
that i say that you know all the things that we have been discussing uh moving beyond the earth

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:32.880
leaving the solar system moving to other stars leaving the earth behind are our obligation

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:42.560
to ourselves our obligation to the earth itself our obligation to life our obligation to the

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:51.120
universe and even so steven doesn't uh use explicitly religious words our obligation to god

01:06:52.160 --> 01:07:03.680
now this is the ethos that i recommend which is basically a reformulation of the cosmist ethos

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:15.840
in a language that is more understandable to people here and now let's fill this obligation

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:25.440
that we have to ourselves into the universe around us to contribute to awaken the universe

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:35.600
to life consciousness super intelligence and perhaps god-like nature this is our obligation

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:43.040
this is what we are here for when uh earlier you said of course there are excuse me of course

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:48.160
there are other lives beyond earth on what basis do you say that on what kind of life

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:55.360
on what kind of life are you talking about conscious life or just like bacterial life or bacteria

01:07:55.360 --> 01:08:03.440
bacteria i guess it could be conscious too but you know what i mean bacterial life and animal life

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:10.960
and the human life life and conscious life and super conscious life there is room for all possible

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:20.400
uh source of life as a matter of fact i'm persuaded that no life is not an accident it's not uh the

01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:28.320
result of uh excuse me one moment i have to pay my life again that uh she wants to cook dinner so

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:37.760
things just happened just yeah just a five uh just five more minutes after that

01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:45.520
okay but this uh but this thing about life is important you know uh life is not a random

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:53.920
accidents that happened as a result of a random fluctuation that uh happened but could not

01:08:54.720 --> 01:09:05.120
have happened i have a completely different view i think that the very loss of fundamental physics

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:13.760
are wired to eventually reduce complexity life consciousness intelligence

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:22.400
super intelligence and godliness it could not have been another way it has to be this way

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:34.000
one consequence is that there is life everywhere it's not ruled out that we will find some

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.720
elementary examples of life here in the solar system for example there is a mission

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:47.760
planned to one of the ice moons in the outer solar system that may have an ocean

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:59.280
which may have more life we will find something in the solar system and when we eventually move out

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:08.080
to the stars we will find all sorts of life from simple life to societies like

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:17.680
our human civilization to inconceivably more advanced alien societies we will find all that

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:24.480
great i'm not gonna keep you much further from the delicious dinner that i'm sure your wife is

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:30.000
preparing it my best to your wife as well julio prisco's book thank you very much book is called

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:36.480
future with space flight meditations uh check him out all over uh internet wonderful i'm also

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:43.920
showing uh showing the cover and the amazon page and all that um just please share your message

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:54.880
to the humanity as the final saying of this episode of podcast

01:10:54.880 --> 01:11:13.840
uh let's just go to space

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:29.840
so
