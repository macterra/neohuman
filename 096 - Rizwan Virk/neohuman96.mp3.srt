1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
He believed in an infinite series of times, in a dizzily growing, ever-spreading network

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,400
of diverging, converging, and parallel times.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,140
This web of time, the strands of which approach one another, bifurcate, intersect, or ignore

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,640
each other through the centuries, embraces every possibility."

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:29,920
Rizwan Virk, welcome back to Neohuman Podcast this time, the 96th episode, sir.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,920
Well, thanks so much for having me on again.

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,760
I enjoyed our conversation last time, so it's always fun to be back.

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,760
Amazing.

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,040
And congratulations on your new book, which we're going to talk a lot about and everything

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:49,000
about and around it, The Simulated Multiverse, an MIT computer scientist explores parallel

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,360
universes, the simulation hypothesis, quantum computing, and the Mandela Effect, which I

12
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,720
believe is a continuation of your first book that we talked about the first time you were

13
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,440
here, The Simulation Hypothesis, right?

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,480
Yeah, that's right.

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,000
It's sort of a sequel in a way, even though it's not fiction, so it's not quite a sequel

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,160
in the same way that The Lord of the Rings might be.

17
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:21,680
But I had wrapped up my first book, and I'd given a talk at Google in Mountain View, California,

18
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,900
where the Googleplex headquarters is, and one of my old colleagues from MIT had just

19
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,320
started working for Google, and he was visiting Mountain View.

20
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,480
So we sat down, and we were having coffee.

21
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,920
And he said, you know, I've been reading your book, and what you're talking about, this

22
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,800
idea of a simulation helps to explain this strange thing called the Mandela Effect.

23
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,800
Have you heard of it?

24
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,400
And I said, yeah, I've heard of it, but I dismissed it as just kind of faulty memory

25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,600
on the part of a bunch of people.

26
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:55,360
And so that actually led me down this rabbit hole of exploring this idea of multiple timelines

27
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,400
and doing a big what-if scenario.

28
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,280
And so the second book is saying, well, what if, you know, these people who are reporting

29
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,440
different memories aren't totally crazy?

30
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,000
What does quantum physics have to say about this?

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,080
What does computer science have to say about this?

32
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,040
What does the simulation theory have to say about this?

33
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,700
And so the new book is kind of a mix of these different themes and bringing them together

34
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,840
into this new model.

35
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,840
Yeah, a very interesting thing about you is that you bring, it's kind of at least an attempt,

36
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:29,600
I would say, to unify science and spirituality and religion into some kind of singular comprehensive

37
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:36,200
understanding of what is going on beyond this physical reality of experience that we are

38
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,520
having based on the limitation of ourselves, not only biologically, but also ideologically.

39
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,480
Would that be accurate to say?

40
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,600
Yeah, I think that would be accurate to say.

41
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,400
I mean, someone asked me once, you know, well, why did you write this book?

42
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:58,160
And my main, for my first book, for the simulation hypothesis, part of my motivation was to try

43
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,780
to bridge this ever increasing gap between science and religion.

44
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:09,380
And I feel like the point of mystics is to try to understand the true nature of reality.

45
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:14,160
And the point of science is to try to understand the true nature of reality.

46
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,840
And the point of philosophy is to try to understand the nature of reality.

47
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,680
That each is doing it with completely different tools and they don't always talk to each other.

48
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,000
And you know, if you go back, you know, 500 years to the time of Galileo and the church,

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,160
you might say that the church had what academics like to call epistemological dominance.

50
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,840
This is the way we think about it.

51
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,080
The only way we know how to do it is because God said it was in the Bible.

52
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,920
Now we've shifted to the other extreme, right?

53
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:50,280
We have this epistemological dominance of the scientific worldview and that dismisses

54
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,600
other points of view, whether it's shamanism or it's, you know, mystical view from the

55
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,440
Eastern traditions or even the Western religions.

56
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,800
And so I believe simulation theory gives us at least a framework where we can combine

57
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,200
these different worldviews, but also understand them both as different aspects of the search

58
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,900
for truth.

59
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,720
And it's one of the few frameworks I've come across where I can talk about it with people

60
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,880
that are PhDs in science and with technologists in Silicon Valley, but also with Buddhist

61
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,200
monks and people that are, you know, adherence to a particular religion as well.

62
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:29,280
And so there are very few topics that you can kind of universally talk about and it's

63
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,680
a framework that lets us to do that.

64
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,760
You might say it's an interactional or translational framework in a way, because it translates

65
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,920
language of one into language that the other can understand and actually agree with.

66
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,880
This scientific and academic orthodoxy that we're dealing with right now, would you say

67
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:54,040
that science has turned into scientism and a lot of scientists have turned into priests

68
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:59,240
and basically the entire approach had turned into a religion and religious ideological

69
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:06,000
kind of an approach rather than scientific curiosity that, you know, science is never

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
settled.

71
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,560
It's not perfectly part of the nature of science to challenge ideas and to have debate and

72
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:20,400
conversation about it, but we seem to be dealing with people who are more of a bureaucrats

73
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,480
than people like Carl Sagan, for example, people who are politicians and not really

74
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,560
interested in, as you're saying, finding or at least attempting to finding the nature

75
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,560
of reality.

76
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:42,560
Yeah, I think very much that, you know, science has turned into this, what is called scientism

77
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,120
sometimes, and it's this idea that our way of knowing is the only way of knowing and

78
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:56,360
if we haven't endorsed it, if our priests or our members of our community haven't reached

79
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,360
a consensus.

80
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,280
Now, it's obviously not the same as existing religions, but there is this element, you

81
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,400
know, part of what I'm doing now is I'm actually studying the history of science and technology

82
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,920
at ASU, working on a PhD, which I just started actually, and we're looking at the social

83
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,240
construction of science.

84
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,480
And so there used to be a point of view, particularly in for much of the 20th century, that scientists

85
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,080
have access to the truth and nobody else has access to the truth.

86
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:33,320
And when you kind of open the box and look in a little bit and you see, well, what does

87
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,440
that mean?

88
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,720
How is science constructed?

89
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,440
You realize that it's a socially constructed thing in that there are different ways of

90
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,440
looking at things.

91
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,680
There are different ways of funding different types of experiments, and so which experiments

92
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,560
get funded and which get taken seriously.

93
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,920
And there's something called boundary work, where it's kind of pushing back on other areas

94
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,880
of knowledge to say that's not science, therefore we're not going to take that seriously.

95
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,760
And so you've seen a concerted effort to do this.

96
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,360
And so as I said, it was kind of a response to the dominance of the other side in the

97
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,740
past, but now we've gone too far, I think, in the direction of science where other ways

98
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:20,540
of knowing and other realities and even anecdotal examples are pushed out.

99
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:26,680
For example, people used to report seeing rocks fall from the sky back before the 1800s,

100
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,840
but the scientists in Europe said, well, that's ridiculous, because there are no rocks in

101
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,840
the sky.

102
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,280
Therefore, we are going to assume that you're lying or you're crazy or misinformed, and

103
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:42,400
you see that same attitude, for example, with UFO reports, which are very anecdotal.

104
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:49,040
And only recently now we're starting to see people like Avi Loeb at Harvard, who was the

105
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,720
previous head of the astronomy department, who are trying to create a real scientific

106
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,120
effort to study.

107
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,960
And so I think too often the priorities in science are not necessarily driven by curiosity

108
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,680
about the world, but how to advance the specific set of knowledge, the kind of this edifice

109
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:10,520
that we've built without going back and reexamining that maybe there's parts of this edifice in

110
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,760
the foundation that aren't quite right and that there are holes in that.

111
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:20,240
And that's what many of these anomalous experiences are showing us, is that our cosmological model

112
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,040
of the world, just like before, we didn't know there were asteroids beyond Earth, therefore

113
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,800
they couldn't fall to Earth.

114
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
Same thing here.

115
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,040
We don't acknowledge that there are any other realities beyond the physical, therefore we

116
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:39,700
can't conceive that any such thing like a shaman having a non-ordinary reality experience

117
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,680
could be a real experience, right?

118
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,880
That's just put into the realm of psychology and imagination.

119
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:51,000
So when you're saying this so-called scientism is not the same as religion, I totally agree.

120
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,960
But like your book, it seems like scientism is a sequel to conventional religions, which

121
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:03,640
hints, at least to me, to something much deeper within human nature, that we need religions,

122
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:13,080
we need this superior kind of an authority in order to set some kind of a point of alignment

123
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:18,720
for the collective of humanity to move towards, to strive towards, perhaps.

124
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:26,680
Right, and I think that may be a human need, it may be a social need of the way in which

125
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:34,600
our societies are constructed, right, because we now share communication much more freely

126
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,560
than we did in the past, and so we've got large groups of people that are part of, say,

127
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,320
a nation-state that are looking to the government, for example.

128
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:50,880
And so I think that's true, that there is a need for people to look to authority, and

129
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:58,440
you'll see these statements, well, you either trust science or you don't trust science.

130
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,760
And the more you look at it, you realize that for people that are in the know, that's not

131
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,080
that simple, right?

132
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,280
Scientists, true scientists, will never make these grandiose statements, right?

133
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:13,100
They will go in and make very specific statements about very specific experiments.

134
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,980
And that's all, if you read the scientific papers, that's all they're allowed to say.

135
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:23,160
But then when you translate that to the public, it becomes this broader understanding of everything

136
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:28,000
else is ridiculous, homeopathy doesn't work, we know it doesn't work, therefore everyone

137
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,640
who does it is a fraud, right?

138
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:37,080
So you get into those kinds of, I think, not just statements, but also you have a general

139
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,440
public that's looking for that authority.

140
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,080
Because most people want to believe what's told to them either in the media or by authority,

141
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,080
and then they repeat that.

142
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,000
And with social media, we have that happening ad infinitum, right?

143
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,680
So you have people repeating the same arguments that they've heard somewhere else.

144
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,280
There are very few people who actually might know the underlying scientific data or the

145
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,280
facts.

146
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:05,120
But this issue of who gets credibility and who doesn't is an interesting one.

147
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,760
And you can study that.

148
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,800
And within the scientific circles, there is a lot of effort to try to keep certain people

149
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
out of that.

150
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:19,680
A good example is the honeybees, right, what they call colony collapse disorder.

151
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,760
Many of the beekeepers say, well, it may have something to do with all these pesticides,

152
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,200
and they've had intuitions about it because they're seeing different movements of the

153
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
bees.

154
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,840
But the way that science has framed the issue of a particular pesticide is they will do

155
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:37,920
an experiment on a single pesticide, and if it doesn't cause a problem above a certain

156
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,000
threshold, that's considered safe.

157
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,680
They're not necessarily testing a whole bunch of these different things together.

158
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,520
And as such, they're trying to exclude the expertise of the beekeepers, for example,

159
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,800
when in fact they should be recognizing that there is some expertise here that comes from

160
00:11:53,800 --> 00:12:00,040
a different kind of experience that should have a credibility in the debate as well.

161
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,680
So I definitely think that's there.

162
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,240
Now, that's not to say that science can't continue to improve.

163
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,680
I mentioned Avi Loeb and investigating UFOs.

164
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,680
That was an area that was considered, you know, stigmatized.

165
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,880
No one would do that at a respectable university for a while.

166
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,840
And now it's starting to open up.

167
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:22,360
And so you can see that even science evolves over time, mind, body, you know, connection

168
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,520
with meditation, reducing stress, leading to health benefits.

169
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:30,080
It's something that doctors 50 years ago would have said, yeah, you know, do it if you like,

170
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,400
but it's not going to help you.

171
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,600
And most doctors still have that attitude, but there has been enough research now to

172
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,320
suggest that doing yoga, doing meditation, these things to improve health, even if we

173
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,520
don't always understand the exact mechanism why.

174
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,400
How would you assess Google's perspective and approach within this context?

175
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:56,000
Because Google and YouTube, you know, their approach have been criticized and quite justly

176
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,720
because they're ranking based on their own, you know, preference and biases.

177
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:07,640
They're in many cases changing search results in order to, you know, direct people towards

178
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,520
a certain kind of outcome.

179
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:15,480
When you talk to them about this kind of thing and your book, how do they respond?

180
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,760
What are they thinking?

181
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,680
Because Google, I think, is even more important to talk about than a lot of governments considering

182
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:26,380
the amount of technological might and power that is under their control.

183
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:31,480
And they don't have checks and balances that, let's say, the American system, for example,

184
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,600
has embedded within it.

185
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,240
Yeah, well, you know, what I find is that, you know, people at Google, and I just gave

186
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,440
a talk there a few weeks ago, you know, they're pretty open to this idea of the simulation

187
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,800
hypothesis and this idea that there's computation underlying the physical universe.

188
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,020
And that's because they're coming at it from the point of view of computer science being

189
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,020
a software company.

190
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,080
So I think from that perspective, they're very open minded.

191
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,960
Yet, if you look at my talk at Google, my first one, you know, at the end, I was talking

192
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,160
about the matrix and a spoon being bent.

193
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,560
And I showed them some pictures from a spoon bending party that had just taken place in

194
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,680
Santa Clara, like the week before.

195
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,280
And they all started like, what is this guy doing?

196
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,300
He's showing us pictures of spoon bending?

197
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,540
We know that's false.

198
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,540
We know that doesn't happen, right, without examining their own beliefs of, well, why

199
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,820
do they believe it's false?

200
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,120
Because they heard it in the media.

201
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,320
They heard that it was discredited long ago, right?

202
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,320
Do they have any experience?

203
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,320
Have any of them ever gone to a spoon bending party?

204
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
Absolutely not.

205
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,400
So you definitely have a lot of that.

206
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,340
But I think what's happened is, you know, in the same way, if we went back 50 years,

207
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:44,240
there were primarily three networks with the news that was disseminated or broadcast and

208
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,600
you had to tune in at six or 11.

209
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,600
And that was it.

210
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,600
That was all you got, right?

211
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,720
And then there were certain newspapers.

212
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,960
And if you look at the history of that, you realize there was government priorities.

213
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,520
There were social priorities and there were priorities of the government that impacted

214
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,240
the media.

215
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,720
But because they became so pervasive, they were regulated in a certain way.

216
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,560
And so only certain stories made it out.

217
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:13,000
Now what's happened with Facebook and Google in particular and YouTube is they've gotten

218
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,760
so big that now you have the intersection of politics with technology, right?

219
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:23,080
It's no longer just about, you know, what does the technology say and the politics.

220
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,920
And so science is sort of informing, you know, a lot of that.

221
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,040
But also, so are the priorities.

222
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:35,960
And so because, for example, we've been in the middle of a pandemic, right, you see all

223
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:41,280
kinds of efforts within YouTube to basically ban anything that mentions any kind of, you

224
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:49,240
know, paranormal phenomenon, as opposed to because of the priorities of the society in

225
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,480
this case is, hey, we got to get out of this pandemic.

226
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,480
How do we do that?

227
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,120
And so not that I want to get too much into a debate on that.

228
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,640
It's kind of far and field from my work.

229
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:04,640
But I think you do get, you know, priorities that are set both by society and in terms

230
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,520
of what people are worried about and political intervention that we may not even know about.

231
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,600
So we may not even know about some of the discussions that have been going on to set

232
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:20,440
priorities and to decide what is acceptable knowledge and what is not acceptable knowledge.

233
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:25,720
And to me, you know, that's where I find that bringing in this idea of the metaphor

234
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,560
of a video game or an interactive video game, suddenly people who are hardcore atheists

235
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,240
say, well, I can see that beings from outside the simulation would look to us as if they

236
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,400
were supernatural because they have powers that we don't have and they have the ability

237
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,520
to control events and just as programmers can or super users can within video games.

238
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,240
And so I think there there may be ways to bridge this gap because it's been getting

239
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,860
wider and wider.

240
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:55,000
But that's part of my work, I think, and the reason I wrote these two books is to provide

241
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,200
a technological framework that says reality may be more complicated than what we think

242
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
it is.

243
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,200
Absolutely.

244
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,800
I had Jason Reza Georgiani on the show.

245
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,800
I don't know if you know him.

246
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:12,540
He has a new book, Closer Encounters, PhD professor, very well known, very controversial.

247
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:19,520
And his thesis is also that aliens are actually humans who at some point they discovered time

248
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,760
traveling capability and they're changing the timelines of our experience from the fifth

249
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,920
dimension.

250
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,160
And when I was going through your book, I'm like, holy shit, you basically are talking

251
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,360
about the same thing.

252
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,840
And he's getting mocked and ridiculed because of it.

253
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,040
And I'm sure you have come across a lot of people like, you just don't know what you're

254
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,040
talking about.

255
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:48,640
But more and more as we digitizing our reality, it seems like it is a completely feasible

256
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,520
at least possibility that we have to consider.

257
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,520
Yeah.

258
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:57,720
And I mean, I've heard of him, but I haven't read his book, so I didn't know about that

259
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,720
specific argument.

260
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:07,440
But yeah, I mean, I find that if I frame the discussion in terms of language and computer

261
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,600
science and information science, and you can tie that to the physics, because what's happening

262
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:20,520
in physics is over time, I think they're realizing that the physical world doesn't really exist.

263
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,480
And we might have talked about this last time, but there was John Wheeler, who was one of

264
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,200
the famous physicists of the 20th century at Princeton.

265
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,480
He worked with Einstein and with Bohr.

266
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,040
And he was the supervisor of Hugh Everett, who came up with a quantum multiverse idea,

267
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,840
which we can talk about in a minute.

268
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,000
But he came to the conclusion that physics went through three stages in his lifetime

269
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,340
in the 20th century.

270
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,200
It went from everything is a particle, right?

271
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:50,120
This is the old view of the Greeks that an atom is the smallest physical object, and

272
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:55,520
you just put them together, to everything is a field of probability, to the conclusion

273
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:01,160
that he came to, the only thing that defines a particle is a series of yes, no questions,

274
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,160
answers.

275
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,960
And those are bits of information.

276
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,320
I mean, that is exactly what a bit is.

277
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,800
It's a one or a zero.

278
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,440
And if you want to distinguish one particle from another, the only thing to distinguish

279
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,160
it are these kind of bits of information.

280
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,760
And so he came up with the phrase, it from bit.

281
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,240
So anything that seems like an it, like a physical object, like your microphone or my

282
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,520
computer or this table, right, is actually composed of bits of information.

283
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,480
And so I find that, you know, there's more agreement on that even today than there was,

284
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,180
you know, when he made that statement, which was back in the 80s, I think, when he came

285
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,840
up with that statement.

286
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,160
Today, you know, there's this area of digital physics, right?

287
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,200
In physics, we always talk about the conservation of matter or of energy.

288
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,000
Now there's an area where they're looking at the conservation of information, like how

289
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,220
much information is in the universe, which is represented by bits.

290
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:59,440
If you look at biology, the idea of a gene and DNA, it's really just a compact representation

291
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,200
of bits of information when then algorithms that you have for refining that information

292
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,280
and running it.

293
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:11,960
And so, you know, the conclusion that I came to was that the universe is a process that

294
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:17,200
is computationally irreducible, which is a term that was defined by Stephen Wolfram,

295
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,120
who created the Mathematica software and who was a physicist turned computer scientist.

296
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,100
And what that meant was you couldn't just find out what's going to happen by solving

297
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,480
a simple equation.

298
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,560
You had to run the steps.

299
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:34,880
So if you want to see what's going to happen in year 1000, you have to go run the simulation

300
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,640
up to year 999, and then you have to run 365 days of it.

301
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,720
And so, you know, millions of steps in the simulation.

302
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,040
And then you will see exactly what happens at that point in time.

303
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:52,380
And so, you know, I came to the conclusion that we may be living in this kind of a reality

304
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:59,760
where time is being run forward and then it's being rewound and can be rerun again.

305
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:05,440
Now, that makes no sense if you have a model of there's one timeline that goes from the

306
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,260
past to the future and there's one physical world.

307
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,760
So my previous book, The Simulation Hypothesis, was telling us the physical world is not what

308
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,760
we think it is.

309
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,220
It is mostly based on information.

310
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:20,020
This book is kind of about the fact that time is not what we think it is.

311
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:24,040
What we think of the future and the past are not the same.

312
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:29,000
And I talk about the delayed choice experiment, which was a thought experiment that John Wheeler,

313
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,440
who I just mentioned, came up with, you know, back in like the 60s, and it has to do with

314
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,520
the double slit experiment and with Schrodinger's cat.

315
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:41,100
And the whole idea is that the cat, we would think it's either alive or dead.

316
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:46,720
But within this thought experiment, quantum mechanics says the cat is in superposition

317
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,440
until we observe it and measure it, which means that it is both alive and dead.

318
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,440
Now that sounds ridiculous.

319
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,600
And even Schrodinger came up with the example because he said that sounds ridiculous.

320
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,160
It can't be both.

321
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:03,200
But even Schrodinger back in the 40s realized that quantum mechanics was telling us something

322
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,400
weird that there are what he called multiple simultaneous histories, right?

323
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,800
And the delayed choice experiment is a good way to think about this because if you think

324
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,040
of the cosmic version of it, we have, say, a quasar that is a billion light years away

325
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:23,040
sending us a light, and we have a gravitationally large object like a black hole or a galaxy

326
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:27,080
in the middle, and the light can go to the left or to the right, and we can have telescopes

327
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,400
here on Earth that can figure out, you know, which way did the light go because it will

328
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,320
just pick up the one that went left or the one that went right.

329
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,200
Now if that black hole is a million light years from us and the quasar is a billion

330
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,760
light years from us, when does the decision about whether to go left or right, you know,

331
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,040
when is that decision made?

332
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,640
It has to be made a million years ago because for the light to get here, it would take it

333
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,040
a million years.

334
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,460
But what the delayed choice experiment is telling us is it's not until we measure the

335
00:22:53,460 --> 00:23:00,400
light here on Earth in the present that one of those possible pasts is chosen.

336
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,920
So this gets into just a strange idea about, you know, what is the past?

337
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,200
What does it mean for something to have happened, right?

338
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,760
And again, it seems nonsensical unless you start to think about a graph of possibilities

339
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,720
that shows all the different timelines, both going backwards and forward from the current

340
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,960
point in time.

341
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,040
And in this book, that is what I call the multiverse graph.

342
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:28,480
And in the simulated model, it makes more sense because what it means that something

343
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:34,880
happened just means that we are rendering that specific pathway through the multiverse

344
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,600
graph.

345
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,480
And I talked a little bit about this last time as well.

346
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:45,560
The reason we can create these very expansive 3D virtual worlds and MMORPGs like World of

347
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:50,680
Warcraft or Fortnite, where my avatar and your avatar are hanging out and we're walking

348
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,060
around and shooting at other people.

349
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,680
Back in the 80s, you couldn't do that.

350
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,360
You couldn't create games like that.

351
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,440
And you might say, well, we didn't have enough processing power, but we also didn't know

352
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,720
how to keep track of all those pixels.

353
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,680
And so what happened between then and now is we learned optimization techniques that

354
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:10,840
said render only that which is observed by your avatar.

355
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:15,720
And so we only rendered the particular probability or possibility that needs to be shown and

356
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,080
only that which can be seen.

357
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,160
And so the golden rule within video games is render only that which is observed.

358
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,600
Turns out that's the same golden rule that quantum mechanics is telling us.

359
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,000
We only render that which is observed.

360
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,240
And if you think of that, all the possibilities as being this giant graph of timelines, and

361
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,280
that's really what the quantum multiverse is all about.

362
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,800
It's about different choices and different timelines.

363
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:44,560
Then that gives us a new and interesting way to think about it, which I call the simulated

364
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,560
multiverse.

365
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,560
Can I read you a poem?

366
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,560
Sure.

367
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,560
Absolutely.

368
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:59,400
It's called Infinite Parallel Universes, universes, parallel, infinite, all here, slightly different

369
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:07,120
like radio waves, tune in with a choice, tune out with a choice, each choice a path to live

370
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:17,960
the consequences, each path a chance, slightly different, all here, infinite, parallel universes.

371
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,960
That's great.

372
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,080
That's very much along the same ideas that I've been writing about.

373
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,760
Is that a poem that you wrote or one that you found?

374
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:33,440
Last June, I woke up in a, I don't want to promote my book, but I would love to send

375
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,080
you a copy.

376
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:42,360
I woke up for like three weeks and right when I woke up, a poem came to my head, just like

377
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,840
in an instant and I wrote it and it was gone.

378
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,320
I had no other poems, like I didn't think I was a poet or anything like that.

379
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,680
And then there were 22 of them.

380
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,720
I think there were like 19 of them actually.

381
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,920
I had two from before, I kind of revised them and made them into a book.

382
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:05,600
As I said, I would love to send you a copy, but it seems like exactly what you're talking

383
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,600
about.

384
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,600
Yeah very much.

385
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:15,480
There's a great story that I mentioned in the book from like the early 20th century

386
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:21,640
called The Garden of Forking Paths by Jorge Luis Borges, who I think was a South American

387
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,600
writer that I think is very, very related to what you wrote there.

388
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:31,440
So it may be something that you want to check out, but in The Garden of Forking Paths, it's

389
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,680
about a labyrinth in which all men will lose their way and an ancient Chinese writer who

390
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,440
wrote this book and they couldn't quite figure out what he was writing because it didn't

391
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,440
make any sense.

392
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,760
There were all these different possibilities and stuff and you have a scientist who kind

393
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:50,760
of figures that out in the present and he says that the Garden of Forking Paths is a

394
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:57,160
picture, incomplete yet not false, of the universe such as this particular Chinese ancestor

395
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:02,960
of the person talking conceived it to be different, differing from Newton and Schopenhauer.

396
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,040
Your ancestor did not think of time as absolute and uniform.

397
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:10,680
He believed in an infinite series of times in a dizzily growing, ever-spreading network

398
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,360
of diverging, converging and parallel times.

399
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:19,120
This web of time, the strands of which approach one another, bifurcate, intersect or ignore

400
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,140
each other through the centuries, embraces every possibility.

401
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,360
And so I quote that in the simulated multiverse.

402
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,800
So yeah, I'd be happy to take a look.

403
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,320
I think your poem is a great example of exactly that.

404
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:37,080
Yeah, this really is a convergence of everything that humanity has been developing and figuring

405
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:43,000
out and dreaming and imagining, which begs the question, are we digitizing the world

406
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,520
or are we just unveiling the world that is already digital at its core and at its nature?

407
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:57,560
Because it seems like, sorry to jump when you were...

408
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:05,800
We are building the metaverse now, and metaverse technically has the potential to simulate

409
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:10,040
this reality, but man-made, for lack of a better term.

410
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:16,380
Now man is enhanced by technology, but it seems like the core of reality isn't that

411
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:24,000
much of a difference from what we've been building towards, each part being a sequel

412
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:31,200
to the previous part, all building towards this ultimate discovery of the world that

413
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,200
is digital.

414
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:37,000
Yeah, I mean, I think you're on the right track there.

415
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,520
So there's a lot of talk about the metaverse these days, and Facebook changed its name

416
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:50,120
as a company to Meta to show how important the metaverse is going to be to its future.

417
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,080
And so some people say, well, that's just to get away from all the negative press, the

418
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,800
social media, but Zuckerberg has been interested in this idea of the metaverse, which comes

419
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:07,360
from a 1992 science fiction novel called Snow Crash by a cyberpunk type of novel by Neil

420
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,840
Stevenson.

421
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:14,400
And so the metaverse is very much about building virtual worlds, and there are what I call

422
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,840
the threads of the metaverse.

423
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:21,120
And one of those threads is sort of mirroring the physical world in the digital world.

424
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:26,300
And how I got interested in simulation theory is actually along these lines.

425
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:30,460
So back in 2016, I was visiting a startup that was doing virtual reality, and I put

426
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:34,480
on the headset and I started to play ping pong.

427
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:40,320
And it was so realistic in the responsiveness that for a moment I forgot that I was in virtual

428
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:45,840
reality, and I tried to put the paddle down on the table and I tried to lean against the

429
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,040
table just like I might do at the end of an actual table tennis game.

430
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,680
And of course, to paraphrase the matrix, there is no table.

431
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,400
So the controller fell to the floor and I almost fell over.

432
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,740
And that's when I started to realize that eventually our virtual reality will get so

433
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,000
good that it'll be indistinguishable.

434
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,140
And I call that point the simulation point, at the point where we can build something

435
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,160
like the matrix ourselves.

436
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:15,400
And so I laid out the 10 stages of technology that we would have to get there, and it turns

437
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,040
out these are very related to the metaverse, right?

438
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:23,160
So the metaverse is we're building it today is in kind of the stages that we're at on

439
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,880
the road to the simulation point.

440
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:31,720
So enhanced AR and VR, also, you know, we are starting to discover augmented reality

441
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:37,600
where we can place digital objects in the world around us, which eventually we will

442
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,620
be able to do this without the glasses, using light field technology.

443
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:45,120
So we're blurring the line between what is digital and what is physical.

444
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,800
I call that, you know, the holodeck scenario, right, where we would be able to walk into

445
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,840
a room and see things that aren't there.

446
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,720
But to us, it would seem like they are.

447
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,080
And similarly, our 3D printers are getting so good that they can start to print things

448
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:02,440
out like in Star Trek, the next generation, you know, when Captain Picard used to go and

449
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,440
say tea, Earl Grey hot, and the replicator would just create the cup and the tea.

450
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,560
Now we're not quite there yet, but we can create the cup.

451
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:14,040
We can actually 3D print cups now, but we can't necessarily, you know, in the same printer

452
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,280
print the liquid, but eventually we'll get there.

453
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:22,000
But then we get into this area of brain computer interfaces, right, where we can send in what

454
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,560
is digital information into the brain and fool ourselves in the brain to not realize

455
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,640
that where we are is a virtual digital world.

456
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:37,440
And so that leads eventually to this simulation point where, you know, we are having an experience

457
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,800
like the Matrix.

458
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:43,720
And so when I started to research this area of simulation theory, I discovered Nick Bostrom,

459
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:49,440
who is at Oxford, who basically said that if any civilization ever gets to that point,

460
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,840
right, then we're already likely in a simulation because they'll be able to create so many

461
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,200
different digital simulations.

462
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,140
All you have to do is crank up another server that with infinite variety that we're more

463
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,820
likely to be in one of those.

464
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:09,640
And so I think that, you know, part of why the findings of quantum mechanics are so bizarre,

465
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:14,480
right, Niels Bohr said, if you are not shocked by these findings, then you haven't understood

466
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,560
quantum mechanics, right, is because we think we're in a physical world.

467
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:24,600
And so very much if we can get there, and my conclusion is we can get there in 100,

468
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,960
200 years where we can create, you know, these perfect digital replicas of what we think

469
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,360
of as the physical world because we're starting to discover the algorithms, the procedural

470
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:40,720
generation that's used in biology to generate, you know, flora and fauna, for example.

471
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,400
There, you know, there are all kinds of algorithms, fractal, etc., that are starting to be able

472
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,400
to replicate that.

473
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:52,440
There was a game, a video game called No Man's Sky a few years ago, which had like 18 quintillion

474
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:58,080
planets and each one had its own unique set of flora and fauna and animals because they

475
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,640
can all be procedurally generated, which gets back to this idea that at its core, the universe

476
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:10,320
may be more about information and optimizing the storage and transfer of that information

477
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,800
than it is about physical objects, the way that we would think about them in common sense.

478
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:20,460
So yeah, I mean, I think the metaverse is the stages which we would need to go through

479
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:26,680
to get to that simulation point and then we would discover that not only can we totally

480
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:34,080
reproduce the world in digital form, the world already has this underlying structure of digital

481
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:40,120
information, which means we might already be in somebody else's simulation.

482
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:48,600
Some people are completely freaked out by Facebook's attempt to build a metaverse because,

483
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:55,440
and I think it's well-funded that Zuckerberg wants to play the role of God, basically.

484
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:03,160
He wants to be the creator of this world, that it can expand to physical world and every

485
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,720
aspect of our lives, basically.

486
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,920
So it seems like centralization versus decentralization is something that philosophically we always

487
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:16,780
have talked about, but now we have the technological tool to democratize that decentralization

488
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:20,400
in order to build this kind of thing, which is another reason that I'm thinking maybe

489
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:26,560
this whole thing, if there is a purpose for humanity, maybe the purpose is to figure out

490
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:32,600
this digital nature of reality and all of these steps seem like they totally make sense

491
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,720
to get there.

492
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:40,320
But beyond that, which I would love to hear your comments with respect to a form of governance

493
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,640
that we need moving forward, dealing with this kind of a possibility that everybody

494
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:49,960
will be able to basically create their own reality, you know, at first in VR, but then

495
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,680
in AR and mixed reality, right?

496
00:34:53,680 --> 00:35:00,000
But also, how can we ever get to truly recognize and understand the nature of reality, which

497
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,200
is quantum, while our experience is binary?

498
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,600
Well, so there was a lot there that you mentioned.

499
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:15,720
And so, you know, starting with the first part, and Zuckerberg and Facebook trying to

500
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:21,520
dominate the metaverse, and, you know, I think that, you know, they're still operating on

501
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:27,880
a slightly older imaginary, which is a term that's used in academia, social technical

502
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,960
imaginary for how science fiction might represent what could happen in the future.

503
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,840
And when we talk about the metaverse, you know, we're also talking about the imaginaries

504
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:42,200
that we buy into, whether it's Snow Crash, or Ready Player One, which came out a few

505
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:46,020
years ago, where everyone put on the virtual reality headsets.

506
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:50,720
And they use that to go to school, they use that to go to work for relationships to explore

507
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,280
the world, and became the most valuable company in the world.

508
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,920
And, you know, I think, you know, Zuckerberg is operating off of that imaginary, because

509
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,360
he wants to be the company that controls all of that.

510
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:07,000
But technology has a way of innovating and catching up, and sometimes surpassing the

511
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
old imaginaries.

512
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,160
You know, if we look, go back to William Gibson's, you know, Neuromancer, where he defined the

513
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,200
term cyberspace, right, it's the internet has evolved very differently from that.

514
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,860
And even Snow Crash, the metaverse has evolved differently from that.

515
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:27,080
And so today, we have a decentralization mechanism called the blockchain, right, which lets us

516
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:34,000
have digital assets that are owned by individuals that are not necessarily owned by, you know,

517
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,560
just one company, and portability of those digital assets in between different places

518
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,040
of the metaverse.

519
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,240
And so I think one of the most interesting trends in the metaverse is, in fact, this

520
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:51,560
idea that we will have portable digital identities, avatars that we can take into different virtual

521
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:58,840
environments, but also that we can own objects and reuse them in different parts.

522
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:05,480
And so I think that this emergence of blockchain and NFT and cryptocurrency is very interesting,

523
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:10,120
because it provides a counterpoint to the imaginary where one company is controlling

524
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,120
everything.

525
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:15,300
It lets individual content creators create things and then sell those things.

526
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,560
And so it creates a whole economy.

527
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:22,120
Now, what we have today, which we didn't have in the previous iterations of the metaverse,

528
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:31,440
if you go back 10, 15 years to Second Life, you know, was that we didn't, one, most people

529
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,680
in our society were not used to being avatars.

530
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:39,920
Of course, now most younger people today are used to being avatars in games, and are used

531
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,560
to playing with their friends in the same way that, you know, in my case, when I was

532
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:49,240
a kid, we'd go out to the park and play today, they'll, you know, bring their avatars in

533
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:55,040
and go into Fortnite or some other digital representation as a way to hang out with their

534
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,040
friends.

535
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,920
But the digital economy didn't really exist in this way.

536
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,640
It was just in a specific company.

537
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,920
And so you could buy, you could create things and sell them for Linden dollars in Second

538
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,920
Life.

539
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,920
You could also have a job.

540
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,680
And there were people who says, I need to be logged in at 11 p.m. because my job is

541
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,680
a bartender.

542
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,680
Yeah, countries opened up.

543
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,680
In a virtual bar.

544
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,160
Sorry, countries opened up embassies in Second Life.

545
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:23,200
I remember Nike opened up the store in Second Life.

546
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,200
That's right.

547
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,200
Yes.

548
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,640
And so the idea was this was going to be the metaverse, but it was kind of built by one

549
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:34,000
company and the digital economy, you know, what underpinnings weren't there and not enough

550
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,040
people took it up.

551
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:41,680
And even Second Life itself ended up introducing open sourced versions of it because, you know,

552
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,520
the power of the crowd is sometimes bigger than the power of a specific company.

553
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,840
But what we have today with blockchain and Bitcoin and Ether and all the other blockchains

554
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:55,720
that are out there is we have a medium of exchange that is not controlled, you know,

555
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,920
by any central authority.

556
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,200
And I think that is one of the reasons why, you know, governments have been afraid of

557
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,120
Bitcoin and have been afraid of cryptocurrency.

558
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,900
But now, you know, it's just kind of marched on to the point where it's big enough that

559
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,600
it's hard for any one country.

560
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:15,760
Like even China in 2013, you know, I started buying Bitcoin way back in the day.

561
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,400
I used to go to like the Bank of America and take out one hundred dollars and give the

562
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:24,720
cash to this other guy who would literally with his phone send me one Bitcoin outside.

563
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:29,600
But in 2013, China, you know, did one of its many bans on Bitcoin.

564
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,160
It's something that happens every few years now.

565
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,240
And it caused a huge crash in the market.

566
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,240
Now that just happened again.

567
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,440
And it didn't cause such a huge crash in the market because enough people have bought into

568
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,040
this idea of a decentralized medium of economic exchange.

569
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:53,120
And so I think that's part of why I don't think just one company will end up controlling

570
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,120
the metaverse.

571
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:58,400
Now, there will be big players, of course, and Facebook wants to be one of those players.

572
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,840
But usually, you know, when the Internet came about, Microsoft tried to crush Netscape and

573
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,840
they did.

574
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,800
They tried to crush Netscape to become the on-ramp of the Internet.

575
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,960
But what happened?

576
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,920
New companies like Google, Facebook and others came to dominate that medium.

577
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,400
That always happens with technology cycles.

578
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,480
So it may not be Facebook and Zuckerberg that we're talking about ten years from now on

579
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,960
the metaverse.

580
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,600
It may just end up being a whole new set of companies that are doing these kind of decentralized

581
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:32,640
models of virtual ownership and exploring the metaverse.

582
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,240
The second part of the question, if you remember, or you want me to repeat it, because I think

583
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,240
that's something that...

584
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,880
Yeah, why don't you repeat it?

585
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:45,480
Just how can we possibly ever go on to understand, even recognize the true nature of reality,

586
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,960
which is quantum, based on our binary experience of it?

587
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:56,760
Yeah, that's a good question, obviously a big metaphysical question, right?

588
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:07,640
And I believe that a metaphor for the universe of the video game is the best way to understand

589
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,640
it.

590
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:16,000
And if you go back in history, the models and the metaphors that are used are approximations

591
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,880
of what reality might be like.

592
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:23,120
In the religious traditions, in Buddhism, for example, the metaphor of the dream is

593
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,280
used quite a bit.

594
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,480
And in fact, the meaning of the word Buddha is to be awake, right?

595
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,800
When somebody asked him, what are you, and he said, I am Buddha, meaning I am awake.

596
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,440
Well, that implies that everybody else is asleep, right?

597
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,880
And so the metaphor is a powerful one, and it's carried through for this idea that the

598
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,280
world is Maya or illusion.

599
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:51,800
But even to aspects of Tibetan Buddhism, where they have practices of dream yoga, where you

600
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:57,640
learn to wake up within a dream, what we would call lucid dreaming today as a spiritual practice

601
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:03,920
to try to understand the nature of reality, that it is all an illusion.

602
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,240
And so that metaphor is very powerful.

603
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,460
But another metaphor that was used back in the day in the Vedas, for example, is this

604
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:14,240
idea of a stage play or a game play, right?

605
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:19,720
The lila of the gods, the world is the lila of the gods, and we're all playing roles.

606
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:25,200
And even Shakespeare 500 years ago used that metaphor when he said all the world's a stage,

607
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,400
and the men and women are merely players.

608
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:34,240
And then if you go back 100 years, Yogananda, who wrote Autobiography of a Yogi, which is

609
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,920
one of the most popular spiritual books of the 20th century, at least in the West, and

610
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:45,160
he came over after World War I from India to the US, and he used a more up-to-date,

611
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,800
more modern metaphor.

612
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,880
He used the metaphor of a film reel and projection.

613
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,360
He said, like, seeing all the suffering in World War I, he said, it's like a movie,

614
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,600
you're watching it.

615
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,240
And those are the roles that people are playing.

616
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,840
But I believe if those guys were alive today, they would use a different metaphor.

617
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:04,120
They would say, it's like an interactive stage play where we all get to make choices, and

618
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,360
we've kind of all agreed to play these roles.

619
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,840
Well, what does that sound like?

620
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,160
It sounds like an interactive video game.

621
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:15,360
And so that's why I believe this metaphor helps us, because in a video game, we have

622
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:19,600
this idea of the player and the avatar, right?

623
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:24,760
And the avatar is represented digitally inside the computer, and you might ask the same question

624
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,760
of the avatar that you're asking, which is, how can we possibly understand the true nature

625
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:34,280
of reality when everything here is based on bits and digital and binaries, right?

626
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:41,100
But if we then take this broader metaphor of where there's a player that's outside

627
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:46,900
of that game that has a consciousness that can remember not just this particular run

628
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:52,140
of the game, but also the purpose of the game and why they're playing it, and what that

629
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:53,140
consciousness is.

630
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:57,620
Now, I can't tell you if that's a physical reality or just pure consciousness.

631
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:02,720
Now we're into the really metaphysical, you know, worlds of souls and what does it mean

632
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,440
for it to be a soul.

633
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:08,480
And you know, in Buddhism versus Hinduism, there's even disagreement about this.

634
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,160
Like they both kind of agree that you have these multiple lives, you come in, you play

635
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:18,720
a role for a period of time, that life ends, you go back and you come back in.

636
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,120
But in one of them, you have an indestructible soul that's going back and forth.

637
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,240
In the other, in Buddhism, it's not quite so clear.

638
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:29,480
You have what's called a bag of karma, and what is karma anyway?

639
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,560
It's a set of information in the Eastern traditions, right?

640
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:38,640
And that information gets stored somewhere and it gets used in constructing the world

641
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,800
and the experiences that you have the next time around.

642
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,840
And you can view it as, I like to think of it as a cloud server, right, that contains

643
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,440
all of the information.

644
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,040
And as just in the same way that, you know, if you and I are interacting, data is being

645
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,540
stored up on the cloud.

646
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:57,840
And so, you know, while I can't answer that question with any certainty, I can say this

647
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:02,640
is a metaphor that can maybe help us understand how we can understand, you know, the nature

648
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:07,440
of the world, even though we're dealing in these bits of information.

649
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,440
Definitely hinted at it beautifully.

650
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:15,320
And it seems like this re-emergence of psychedelics within the mainstream culture is perfectly

651
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:19,480
timed considering the context that we're dealing with right now.

652
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,920
Yeah, you're right.

653
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,360
So there's a lot of interest in psychedelics again, particularly in therapeutic applications.

654
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,000
But you know, I don't personally don't have a lot of experience with it.

655
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:35,520
But people who have will tell me, well, they'll see like, you know, graphical lines and grids

656
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,920
and said, well, you can really see the simulation, you know, when you're taking DMT or something

657
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:45,880
else and that you can start to see that what we think of as physical reality is not quite

658
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,880
the same.

659
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:53,400
And so it does lead to this question of have we been socialized to see the world a certain

660
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,440
way, right?

661
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:59,560
Getting back to our original discussion about science and the epistemology, which means

662
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,960
how do you know something?

663
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,960
That's what that term means.

664
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,640
And say, this is the only way we know things.

665
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:12,200
But do we then, you know, crystallize this point of view over time when we're children?

666
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:16,600
You know, maybe children who see imaginary friends are not crazy, right?

667
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,880
It's not just imagination.

668
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,380
Maybe they're seeing spirits.

669
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,960
Maybe there are other worlds like Islamic traditions.

670
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:27,280
You know, we have the jinns who are other types of beings who exist outside of the physical

671
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,760
reality, but also outside of the timeline, you know, and this ties to this other thing,

672
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,180
the Mandela effect, which we can talk about in a minute.

673
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:40,140
But I think what you're hinting at, it gets back to I think part of the interest in psychedelics

674
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:46,840
now is to show that our ordinary state of consciousness is not the only state of consciousness

675
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,120
and that there may be systematic ways.

676
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:52,860
Of course, shamans have known this for, you know, hundreds of years, if not thousands

677
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:56,400
of years, and the mystical traditions have been telling this all along.

678
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,920
There are ways to perceive these other worlds.

679
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:05,120
But the interesting thing about psychedelics is that it also is a boundary object, right?

680
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:09,680
In the same way that I talk about the simulation metaphor, it's something that scientific and

681
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,760
technically minded people can understand.

682
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,480
It's something that religious and mystically oriented people can understand.

683
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,620
This is something that scientists can understand because it's a physical substance, right?

684
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:25,440
It's not completely outside of the model of reality that chemicals impact consciousness,

685
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,440
right?

686
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:29,760
And so it's something they can understand, but it's also something that, you know, within

687
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,960
say the South American shamans, it's, you know, known as the gateway to non-ordinary

688
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:36,960
reality, right?

689
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,760
And so it's also an interesting kind of boundary object.

690
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:46,600
I mean, there was a Harvard botanist, ethnobotanist named Wade Davis who, you know, explored looking

691
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,440
at different substances.

692
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:52,560
He wrote a book which was turned into a movie back in the 80s called The Serpent and the

693
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,560
Rainbow.

694
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:58,680
And, you know, he went to Haiti to explore these idea reports of zombies, right?

695
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:05,320
And he was trying to figure out what are the compounds that these shamans or voodoo practitioners

696
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:09,400
used to make somebody appear as if they're dead.

697
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:13,960
And then when they brought them back to life, that they were a zombie that they could control,

698
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:14,960
right?

699
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,600
And so, you know, he found the substance that they were using, which was a very complicated

700
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,920
substance consisted of, you know, puffer fish and other things.

701
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:28,200
But he found that the cultural sets of beliefs around zombies within Haiti in particular

702
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:34,720
were just as an important part of the physical thing, which was a part of it as well.

703
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:39,720
And so, you know, I thought that was an interesting case study of different ways of knowing and

704
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:44,440
thinking about things, you know, and even, you know, somebody who's studying just the

705
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:50,160
physical part realized that there is an element of how we construct our reality, which is

706
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,240
based on beliefs, etc.

707
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:58,160
And so, you know, I find psychedelics an interesting boundary object that can be translated either

708
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,160
way.

709
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:03,920
And like along with simulation theory, maybe one of those things, along with meditation

710
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,920
and stress and yoga, that starts to open up science to this broader reality and very powerful

711
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:09,920
tools.

712
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:18,160
And I have a lot of experience with different kinds of variety, but I tell you this, a lot

713
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:23,040
of people, I think they're going into it with an expectation and a bias.

714
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:29,320
So they're experiencing in order to proving their bias.

715
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:36,320
And I think they're missing out a lot of the experience because it's an incredibly powerful

716
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:43,720
tool but if you go with the idea that you know what enlightenment is and you just want

717
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:47,520
to experience it, then you're just going to limit yourself and you will have what they

718
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,160
call bad trips.

719
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:52,860
Because psychedelics, you know, especially in higher dosage, doesn't care what you think

720
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:57,920
and how you feel, it just shows you what is.

721
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,600
You know, I often describe it as, you know, essence is a water, form is a container.

722
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:06,480
And what psychedelic does is they puts a crack in a container.

723
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:12,560
Now certain kind of psychedelics like Bufo, which is five MEO DMT coming from this one

724
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:19,800
toad out of 7,000 plus amphibian who generates this poison that you can, you know, milk it

725
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,080
and dry it and smoke it.

726
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:26,220
That outright shatters the container.

727
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:28,360
So there is no form.

728
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:33,200
And you know, when people smoke that, they scream and they do things that they can't

729
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,240
even remember it when they're in that state and when they come back, you know, the whole

730
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,520
thing takes like an hour.

731
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,880
You smoke it, you're gone completely somewhere else and in an hour you drive to pick up your

732
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,800
kid from a school and you're perfectly fine after that.

733
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:50,960
So you know, this just reminds me of a quote by Gore Vidal that keeps coming up in these

734
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,340
recent episodes that we don't even know what our cage looks like because we've never seen

735
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,340
it from the outside.

736
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:57,340
Right.

737
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:58,340
Yeah.

738
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:03,480
No, it makes a lot of sense and like I said, I don't have a lot of personal experience

739
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:07,280
with it, but in my conversations with people, you know, they've told me about some of the

740
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:13,400
types of experiences and what they see and it seems very consistent that the ultimate

741
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:18,200
reality is very different than what we are perceiving, you know, on a day-to-day basis

742
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,620
and there's independent existence of some of these other entities, you know, that are

743
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:23,880
out there.

744
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:30,580
So I think it could be a new way, like I said, to really bridge this gap between the materialist

745
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:33,320
point of view and the mystical point of view.

746
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,960
So let's talk about mandala effect.

747
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:41,520
It's in the title of your book and it's one of those things that it forms the reality

748
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:46,800
that we're experiencing, but mostly people completely ignore it that such things exist.

749
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,680
So let's talk a little more about that.

750
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,880
Yeah, sure.

751
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:56,280
And I will say that I also, you know, kind of ignored it initially when I had first heard

752
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,960
of it and most people have probably heard of it at this point, it's a pretty popular

753
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:06,320
internet meme out there, but the idea is that there's a subset of people who remember Nelson

754
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:11,520
Mandela dying in prison in the 80s and some of those people had very specific memories

755
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:16,960
of watching his funeral, his wife Winnie giving the speech and her taking over leadership

756
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,840
of the political party.

757
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:26,120
Now the blogger who coined the term the mandala effect in 2010, a blogger named Fiona Broom,

758
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:29,620
you know, at that point, Mandela was still alive, right?

759
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:33,800
So what were they remembering that it couldn't have been his funeral, could it?

760
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:38,240
And so she noticed that there were a whole bunch of other things that people were remembering

761
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:42,120
differently, ranging from small things like GIF-y peanut butter.

762
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,120
There's no such thing.

763
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:48,480
There's only GIF to lines in movies such as, you know, in The Empire Strikes Back.

764
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,760
Many of us think Darth Vader said, Luke, I am your father.

765
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:56,600
But in fact, he said, no, I am your father, you know, going to entire episodes of Star

766
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:03,880
Trek that people swear they've seen multiple times but don't actually exist to whole movies.

767
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:08,400
And so, you know, this phenomenon has become interesting and it's sort of an internet phenomenon

768
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,480
in that before that, before the internet was so widely used and we could share things so

769
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:19,040
easily within social media or Reddit and other places, you know, it would be hard to know

770
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,320
if anybody else had the same experiences that you have.

771
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:26,120
And so the conventional explanation is, well, that's just faulty memory.

772
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:30,660
But you know, in this book, I explore the idea of what if, in fact, these people are

773
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:37,980
remembering an actual timeline as opposed to simply misremembering things because in

774
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:44,320
some cases, you have what I call higher significance or higher proximity to the specific thing

775
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,600
that we're talking about.

776
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:50,080
Now, you know, for example, there are groups of people who remember the Reverend Billy

777
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:55,880
Graham having died and getting magazine articles with this picture on it who are evangelical

778
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:56,880
Christians.

779
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:02,320
Now, I wouldn't know, you know, when the Reverend Billy Graham died or if he's even still alive

780
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,240
because I'm not an evangelical Christian.

781
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:09,200
But for those people for whom that holds the higher significance, they would know.

782
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:14,600
And there are many, many reports of them saying, well, I remember his funeral years earlier

783
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,560
than he actually died.

784
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:21,160
And I remember Bill Clinton speaking there and I remember getting these magazine articles.

785
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:25,720
And so and similarly, there was a YouTube blogger who was a journalism student who went

786
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:29,760
to South Africa to interview Nelson Mandela in the 80s.

787
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,760
And she was told he's too ill to do the interviews.

788
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,720
So she had to come all the way back from South Africa.

789
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:41,280
And then, you know, she was working a couple of months later for NPR, I think, in Chicago.

790
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,280
And he died.

791
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:46,120
Now, how likely is it that somebody who's a journalist, journalism student and becomes

792
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:51,240
a journalist and goes to see Nelson Mandela is just going to mistake that death for some

793
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:55,920
other black leader who died in prison back in the 80s?

794
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:56,920
Right.

795
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:00,560
Now, I might mistake it or somebody else might mistake it, but they may not.

796
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:04,000
And so, you know, that's where this whole thing started to get more interesting.

797
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,440
And then you get to physical objects.

798
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,440
Right.

799
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,880
So the physical object of the thinker, you know, the statue, which shows a pose kind

800
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:16,400
of like this with, you know, kind of a light, light fist underneath the chin.

801
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,000
Well, there are pictures of people standing next to it in the same pose with their clenched

802
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,080
fist on their forehead, which seems really odd when you look at these physical objects.

803
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:31,600
And there's actually a picture of G.B. Shaw, George Bernard Shaw, in London, just taken

804
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:38,440
just before the unveiling of the bronze statue, the thinker, one of the bronze statues.

805
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:41,920
And it says G.B. Shaw in the pose of the thinker.

806
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,760
And he has his hand on his forehead.

807
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,440
And clearly, the thinker doesn't have that.

808
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:49,500
And so, you know, these things might have more significance or proximity.

809
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:54,280
If you're standing next to a statue, you have a higher proximity to that than somebody who's

810
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:57,200
just heard about it or seen pictures online.

811
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:01,320
But where it really got interesting was in scriptural changes, right?

812
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:07,560
We've all heard, you know, the quote from Isaiah about the lion will lie with the lamb.

813
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,960
And you know, it turns out that's not there.

814
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,280
If you look at the King James Bible, it says the wolf would lie with the lamb.

815
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:17,080
And yet, there are many places where they have pictures of the lion and the lamb with

816
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:20,480
a quote from Isaiah, like physical objects that are left.

817
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:25,360
And so, you know, some people who track this stuff, again, getting back to significance,

818
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:29,960
there are people for whom the Bible verses have real significance that they would be

819
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:35,080
more likely to remember them than somebody who's not into the Bible.

820
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,560
And they track these online.

821
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:41,520
And my thought was, well, it's probably just a mistranslation, you know, as an old version

822
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,200
of the King James Bible, the new version.

823
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:48,320
And some of them claim to have the actual physical book from when they were kids.

824
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,920
And they memorized it, but it's changed.

825
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,000
And so now, in the religious world, you know, they think the explanation might be some sort

826
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,000
of, you know, a satanic force or someone is trying to change it.

827
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,980
So that's a different explanation.

828
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:06,880
But I found this fascinating and said, well, what if, you know, this was really happening?

829
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:11,960
Could it be explained through quantum mechanics, through computer science, and through the

830
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:16,480
metaphor of simulation theory where we run things, you know, multiple times?

831
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,160
And it turns out in the Islamic traditions where, you know, there's something called

832
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:24,240
a hafiz, who's somebody who memorizes the Quran word for word.

833
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,720
I remember thinking when I was a kid, why do they need to memorize the Quran word for

834
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:28,720
word?

835
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,840
We've got written books, you know, and then now we have computers, so you don't really

836
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,720
need to sit there and spend years memorizing this.

837
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:40,520
And so there's the Sufi imam who's on record saying, well, one of the reasons why we do

838
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:46,440
this is because supposedly there are beings outside of time, in this case, jinn, who have

839
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:51,460
the ability to go back and change variables in the past, you know, and change things,

840
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,840
but they can't change our memories, right?

841
00:57:53,840 --> 00:58:00,120
And so, you know, all of this, and you don't have to believe in the Mandel effect necessarily.

842
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:04,240
You know, in my book, I say, well, let's do a what if, let's suppose that these people

843
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:08,040
aren't crazy, they're not just misremembering, and see if we can explain it.

844
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:14,440
And a lot of this reminded me of the science fiction writer, Philip K. Dick, and he gave

845
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:20,720
a speech in Metz, France, in 1977, where he said, we are living in a computer programmed

846
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:26,940
reality and the only clue we have is when some variable is changed, some alteration

847
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,280
is made in our reality.

848
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:31,640
Now that quote has become kind of famous over the years.

849
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:37,320
And so I interviewed his wife, Tessa, for my first book, just because I thought it was

850
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,480
kind of a fun way to talk about simulation theory.

851
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:44,000
And the Wachowskis who created The Matrix were inspired by the writings of Philip K.

852
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Dick.

853
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,360
And, you know, he explored several themes in his science fiction, one of which is what

854
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:54,160
does it mean to be human, but the second one of which is what is reality, what is real

855
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,160
and what isn't.

856
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:58,600
And he explored that theme again and again in his books.

857
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:04,200
And Tessa told me that he came to believe that there were other timelines and that he

858
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,200
had memories of those timelines.

859
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:12,280
And one of those memories is what resulted in his best received book while he was alive,

860
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:17,160
The Man in the High Castle, which was about the German and the Japanese winning World

861
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,360
War II.

862
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:23,360
And he said he remembered that entire timeline moving forward.

863
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,320
But then that timeline got rewound for some reason.

864
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:30,160
And so, you know, this is quite fascinating because he said at one point all of those

865
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:33,160
memories came back to him.

866
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:39,800
And in a process that he used a Greek word called anamnesis, which, you know, means sort

867
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:44,600
of remembering, but literally it means a loss of forgetfulness.

868
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:48,920
And you're remembering all these things that you used to know but that you have forgotten.

869
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:53,240
And so what he was really talking about, I realized, was this idea that you could change

870
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,560
variables and rerun things.

871
00:59:55,560 --> 01:00:00,200
And he said we would have the sense that we were reliving the same events, we were hearing

872
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:03,000
the same words, we'd have a sense of deja vu.

873
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,080
And such an impression is valid.

874
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:09,680
And that is a clue that at some point in the past some variable was changed, some alteration

875
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,280
occurred and an alternate reality branched off.

876
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:17,520
Well, this reminded me a lot of the quantum multiverse explanation that there are multiple

877
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,840
universes with each quantum decision that's made.

878
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:24,200
And so, you know, that kind of tied together for me.

879
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:28,640
And then what Philip K. Dick said that's interesting because the Mandela effect hadn't been defined

880
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:29,640
at the time.

881
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:34,440
But he also said, well, I remember an alternate present because all we would need to do is

882
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:41,120
find a subgroup of people that have a memory of a different timeline.

883
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,880
And so, you know, that's what the Mandela effect is.

884
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,600
It's a group of people who remember different variables.

885
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,840
And it's not just one alternate timeline.

886
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,640
There are lots of Mandela effects.

887
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:54,320
And so, you know, I tried to come up with a framework and actually the framework of

888
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:59,600
quantum mechanics made sense because it, you know, provides for this thing that I call

889
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,480
the multiverse graph, which is the list of all possibilities.

890
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:09,040
Getting back to your poem as well, right, that what we think of as time is not what

891
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,320
we think it is, right?

892
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:16,760
This is about navigating through a particular set of nodes within this graph.

893
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:21,880
And when we say this didn't happen or that didn't happen, you know, this gets back to

894
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:25,720
the idea of the life review and near-death experiences as well.

895
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:30,000
So anyway, that's how, you know, I got into the Mandela effect and that's how it made

896
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,960
its way, you know, into this book, The Simulated Multiverse.

897
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:33,960
That was awesome.

898
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:37,840
If this is not convincing people to go and get this book and read it, I don't know what

899
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:38,840
else would.

900
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:42,080
This is just so beautifully said and tie everything together.

901
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:46,640
The book, once again, is called The Simulated Multiverse and MIT Computer Scientists Explore

902
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:52,040
Parallel Universes, The Simulation Hypothesis, Quantum Computing, and The Mandela Effect.

903
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:55,240
I tell you this because I grew up in Iran and I went to school there.

904
01:01:55,240 --> 01:02:00,840
One of the reasons people attempted to memorize Quran was because if you could memorize Quran,

905
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:04,480
you didn't have to go to military service, which was mandatory.

906
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:10,320
Right, so there's a practical reason, right?

907
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:12,480
Yep, absolutely.

908
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:16,680
The social benefits of a certain way of thinking about things, right?

909
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:21,440
Yeah, but you know, you kind of blew my mind because this is a unique thing about Islam

910
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:29,240
and Quran that they're saying that even if a vow is changed, it's basically a sin.

911
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:33,520
It's one of the biggest sins and the person who changed that vow needs to be killed.

912
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:41,840
So at first, it's very extreme because this is actually a perfect bridge to where I want

913
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:47,600
to go with how we kind of need to reinterpret a lot of these religious and philosophical

914
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,520
principles for this time.

915
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:56,040
It is extreme because this is the same approach of the desert people from 1400 years ago,

916
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,040
right?

917
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:00,840
It's the same thing that they're doing in Afghanistan now and Pakistan and obviously

918
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:07,640
it's not working in this world, but there are a lot of hints and clues within all of

919
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:14,280
these things that we can put together in order to reinterpret and maybe upgrade these kind

920
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,120
of perspective.

921
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:21,520
Let me read you a question that Julio Prisco, I believe you know him.

922
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:26,520
I told him that I'm going to talk to you and he asked me to ask you this question,

923
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:33,360
that what should be done to make new religions inspired by science, for example, based on

924
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:42,400
simulation cosmology, as popular and energizing as traditional religions?

925
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,400
That's an interesting question.

926
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:50,080
I kind of like to call simulation theory the first new religion of the 21st century, right?

927
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:57,960
Because we are at a critical point where enough people understand this metaphor of the video

928
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:05,080
game and that the younger generation spends much more time being avatars within video

929
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,480
games than we ever did before.

930
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:15,440
So they're very open to this idea that what we think of as reality might be in fact like

931
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,200
Minecraft, right?

932
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,040
Might be in fact like Fortnite.

933
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:23,200
And so a lot of times people who read my first book, The Simulation Hypothesis, will tell

934
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:29,240
me, oh, I got into this because my kids asked me, are we living in a simulation?

935
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:36,360
And so I think that, like I said earlier, simulation theory provides a way to think

936
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:41,920
about and reinterpret, just like you were saying, some of these older metaphors that

937
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:42,920
people used.

938
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:46,680
I mean, if you look, we've been talking about the Islamic traditions a little bit.

939
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:51,080
If you go back to the Bible and the Koran and that traditions, they talk about the Book

940
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:55,700
of Life and Judaism and Christianity and the Scroll of Deeds in Islam.

941
01:04:55,700 --> 01:05:00,660
And the Scroll of Deeds is said to be a list, a book, a scroll, something they understood

942
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:07,000
back then, of every single action that you performed in your life with two angels, the

943
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,720
Kiram and Kitabah, I think they were called, and they actually have names, these angels.

944
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:17,320
And of course, if we think of that as there are two angels for every person and there's

945
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:22,220
actually 14 billion angels, I mean, that's an outdated metaphor, right?

946
01:05:22,220 --> 01:05:28,240
And so today in computer science, we use the term daemon for a process that is running

947
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,120
on a computer by itself.

948
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:34,640
And so if we were to record everything, the metaphor of the book seems old.

949
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:37,040
We would simply record everything, right?

950
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:43,560
We would use a video recording, just like we do in Twitch, and to show off our video

951
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:44,560
gameplay.

952
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:49,200
I mean, my nephew, when he was like three years old, would say, hey, I want to watch

953
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,840
Star Wars gameplay.

954
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:55,380
I want to watch that man and that woman playing Star Wars on YouTube, right?

955
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:58,520
And so it's a recording of the actual gameplay.

956
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:03,640
And so if we reinterpret, you know, what these religions were saying, I mean, they were using

957
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:13,200
the metaphors and practices of 1400 or 2000 or 2500 or 5000 years ago into today's terms,

958
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,920
you know, we would use different metaphors.

959
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:19,060
And so I believe simulation theory is a great metaphor for that.

960
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:25,120
But also it kind of, I think, will help because if you look at in the US, for example, the

961
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:30,960
fastest growing religion is not necessarily atheism or Christianity or Islam.

962
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:36,680
It's the fastest growing designation, sorry, not necessarily religion is spiritual, but

963
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:39,880
not religious, right?

964
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:45,520
And so that means people who believe there is more, but who don't find the religious

965
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:52,200
traditions of the traditional of these religions to be palatable within the modern context.

966
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:56,800
And what we have to remember is each of these religions were very modernizing at the time.

967
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:01,920
I mean, they were considered liberal folks who were, you know, literally iconoclast means

968
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,560
the breaking of idols, right?

969
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:07,400
That's literally what the word means based on, you know, the Prophet Muhammad breaking

970
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:12,500
the idols in Mecca at the Kaaba, you know, some 1400 years ago.

971
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:18,240
But the people who created these religions, you know, and even, you know, within Buddhism,

972
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:22,320
there was a response to the caste system, within Hinduism, and so, you know, they were

973
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:27,200
kind of upending the social order somewhat when they created these religions.

974
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:32,080
And so I think, you know, social simulation theory gives us a new way to do that.

975
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:35,900
And you know, I don't know whether it's going to become an organized religion or not.

976
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:37,120
That's an interesting question.

977
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:41,080
I'm following that myself, but I think it certainly could be.

978
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:47,440
But I think it's even better to think of as a way into religion, into the spiritual but

979
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:53,080
not religious ideas, right, for the millions and millions of youngsters today who will

980
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:55,740
be, you know, the leaders of tomorrow.

981
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:59,680
So I think there is an opportunity to kind of broaden the definition.

982
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:04,200
And I think young people today, you know, there isn't such a huge, okay, this is science,

983
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,280
this is religion.

984
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,720
They haven't necessarily been indoctrinated into that in the same way.

985
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:13,200
And so simulation theory gives us, I think, a way to bridge that gap, as I've said before.

986
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,200
Yeah, beautiful.

987
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:20,000
I think the decentralized nature of it is very appealing to me because my understanding

988
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:27,960
of this concept of divine is that it's been hijacked by organized religions, and it really

989
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:32,680
is decentralized, and we are having subjective experiences, and each of our understanding

990
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,320
is a part of it.

991
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:39,880
And it's not only our understanding as humans, you know, a tree has an experience of the

992
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,040
divine in its own way.

993
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:46,640
Sea has, you know, its own experience, rock has its own experience.

994
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:51,520
And mathematically speaking, I was talking to James Lindsay more than a year ago about

995
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,520
this.

996
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:57,560
And he was like, there are certain numbers that we can write and say your name, but after

997
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:01,280
a certain amount of numbers, there is there is nothing we can do about it.

998
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:03,560
We put dot dot dot.

999
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:10,360
And he said that he called it infinite points that he would, he's an atheist, he would recognize

1000
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:16,280
the validity of an argument for God, quote unquote, God as a placeholder in that dot

1001
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:17,880
dot dot.

1002
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:26,200
So it's something like this simulation theory is a fertile ground basically for the decentralized

1003
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:31,000
subjective experience of the divinity and the divine that is everything and anything

1004
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,800
that has any kind of an experience.

1005
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:37,100
Yeah, I think you're right.

1006
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:41,800
It is much more it can be much more decentralized depending on how you view it now.

1007
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:46,240
You know, in my view, I think tends to be what I call the RPG version of simulation

1008
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,240
theory.

1009
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:51,760
Simulation theory also sometimes scares people in the religious sense because of what I like

1010
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:57,360
to call the NPC version or the non-player character version in which everyone is just

1011
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,960
code on the server.

1012
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:02,600
And people freak out if they if they think of it that way, because then it's like, well,

1013
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:03,600
your life is meaningless.

1014
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,180
You're just an AI bot.

1015
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:09,360
But I think that the RPG version, the role playing game version where we are playing

1016
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:14,400
an avatar is the more powerful metaphor and the one that opens up, you know, this ability

1017
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:17,440
because people always say, well, who's outside the simulation?

1018
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:18,440
Is it aliens?

1019
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:19,440
Right.

1020
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,440
You mentioned that earlier as well.

1021
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:21,440
Is it time travelers?

1022
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:25,240
Is it, you know, an evil entity that's controlling it?

1023
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:26,240
Is it jinn?

1024
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,240
Is it Satan's?

1025
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:28,240
Is it God?

1026
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:29,240
Is it these things?

1027
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:30,240
And say, well, what if it's us?

1028
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:31,240
Right.

1029
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:37,360
So we are outside the simulation and we have on our headsets and we are now we have chosen

1030
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,600
to play the game.

1031
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:42,880
We are taking on the challenges in the same way that in a video game you have to have

1032
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:46,000
quests and challenges in order to make the game interesting.

1033
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,480
Otherwise, the game is no fun.

1034
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:51,220
And we've agreed to these challenges in our lives.

1035
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:56,560
And so it becomes a different way to think about the challenges of life and to view the

1036
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:02,360
world, but also to open our minds to this greater perspective that might be out there.

1037
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:03,360
So yeah.

1038
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,360
I mean, I agree with that.

1039
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,840
I think simulation theory can be a doorway to the divide.

1040
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:07,840
Amazing.

1041
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:12,160
The book is called The Simulated Multiverse and MIT Computer Scientists Explores Parallel

1042
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:16,520
Universes, The Simulation Hypothesis, Quantum Computing, and the Mandela Effect.

1043
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:19,640
It's available in Kindle, paperback and audiobook.

1044
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:20,640
Is it available?

1045
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:25,040
It will be available in audiobook soon, but the audiobook has not been released yet, but

1046
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,040
yeah, it will be.

1047
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:30,760
Well, Rizwan, thank you so much again for your time and your generosity with your knowledge.

1048
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:33,120
Every time we talk, it's amazing.

1049
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,440
So I really do appreciate it.

1050
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:40,280
Let's end this program, this episode, with your message to the world as we are surfing

1051
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:46,120
this exponential curve of technological progress towards a singularity and everything that

1052
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:49,520
is happening with and because of it.

1053
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:58,680
Sure, you know, my advice to the world is, you know, let's not take everything so seriously.

1054
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:02,920
And it's very possible that all of this is a video game and the challenges that we're

1055
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:07,320
going through are challenges that we have chosen to be here.

1056
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:11,960
And that can give us a different perspective in life and the challenges are important in

1057
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:38,960
our lives, you know.
