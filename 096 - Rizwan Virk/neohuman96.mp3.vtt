00:00.000 --> 00:04.700
He believed in an infinite series of times, in a dizzily growing, ever-spreading network

00:04.700 --> 00:08.400
of diverging, converging, and parallel times.

00:08.400 --> 00:13.140
This web of time, the strands of which approach one another, bifurcate, intersect, or ignore

00:13.140 --> 00:16.640
each other through the centuries, embraces every possibility."

00:16.640 --> 00:29.920
Rizwan Virk, welcome back to Neohuman Podcast this time, the 96th episode, sir.

00:29.920 --> 00:33.920
Well, thanks so much for having me on again.

00:33.920 --> 00:37.760
I enjoyed our conversation last time, so it's always fun to be back.

00:37.760 --> 00:38.760
Amazing.

00:38.760 --> 00:43.040
And congratulations on your new book, which we're going to talk a lot about and everything

00:43.040 --> 00:49.000
about and around it, The Simulated Multiverse, an MIT computer scientist explores parallel

00:49.000 --> 00:54.360
universes, the simulation hypothesis, quantum computing, and the Mandela Effect, which I

00:54.360 --> 00:58.720
believe is a continuation of your first book that we talked about the first time you were

00:58.720 --> 01:01.440
here, The Simulation Hypothesis, right?

01:01.440 --> 01:03.480
Yeah, that's right.

01:03.480 --> 01:09.000
It's sort of a sequel in a way, even though it's not fiction, so it's not quite a sequel

01:09.000 --> 01:14.160
in the same way that The Lord of the Rings might be.

01:14.160 --> 01:21.680
But I had wrapped up my first book, and I'd given a talk at Google in Mountain View, California,

01:21.680 --> 01:26.900
where the Googleplex headquarters is, and one of my old colleagues from MIT had just

01:26.900 --> 01:30.320
started working for Google, and he was visiting Mountain View.

01:30.320 --> 01:33.480
So we sat down, and we were having coffee.

01:33.480 --> 01:36.920
And he said, you know, I've been reading your book, and what you're talking about, this

01:36.920 --> 01:40.800
idea of a simulation helps to explain this strange thing called the Mandela Effect.

01:40.800 --> 01:41.800
Have you heard of it?

01:41.800 --> 01:46.400
And I said, yeah, I've heard of it, but I dismissed it as just kind of faulty memory

01:46.400 --> 01:48.600
on the part of a bunch of people.

01:48.600 --> 01:55.360
And so that actually led me down this rabbit hole of exploring this idea of multiple timelines

01:55.360 --> 01:57.400
and doing a big what-if scenario.

01:57.400 --> 02:01.280
And so the second book is saying, well, what if, you know, these people who are reporting

02:01.280 --> 02:03.440
different memories aren't totally crazy?

02:03.440 --> 02:06.000
What does quantum physics have to say about this?

02:06.000 --> 02:08.080
What does computer science have to say about this?

02:08.080 --> 02:11.040
What does the simulation theory have to say about this?

02:11.040 --> 02:14.700
And so the new book is kind of a mix of these different themes and bringing them together

02:14.700 --> 02:15.840
into this new model.

02:15.840 --> 02:21.840
Yeah, a very interesting thing about you is that you bring, it's kind of at least an attempt,

02:21.840 --> 02:29.600
I would say, to unify science and spirituality and religion into some kind of singular comprehensive

02:29.600 --> 02:36.200
understanding of what is going on beyond this physical reality of experience that we are

02:36.200 --> 02:40.520
having based on the limitation of ourselves, not only biologically, but also ideologically.

02:40.520 --> 02:42.480
Would that be accurate to say?

02:42.480 --> 02:45.600
Yeah, I think that would be accurate to say.

02:45.600 --> 02:50.400
I mean, someone asked me once, you know, well, why did you write this book?

02:50.400 --> 02:58.160
And my main, for my first book, for the simulation hypothesis, part of my motivation was to try

02:58.160 --> 03:03.780
to bridge this ever increasing gap between science and religion.

03:03.780 --> 03:09.380
And I feel like the point of mystics is to try to understand the true nature of reality.

03:09.380 --> 03:14.160
And the point of science is to try to understand the true nature of reality.

03:14.160 --> 03:18.840
And the point of philosophy is to try to understand the nature of reality.

03:18.840 --> 03:24.680
That each is doing it with completely different tools and they don't always talk to each other.

03:24.680 --> 03:29.000
And you know, if you go back, you know, 500 years to the time of Galileo and the church,

03:29.000 --> 03:35.160
you might say that the church had what academics like to call epistemological dominance.

03:35.160 --> 03:36.840
This is the way we think about it.

03:36.840 --> 03:41.080
The only way we know how to do it is because God said it was in the Bible.

03:41.080 --> 03:43.920
Now we've shifted to the other extreme, right?

03:43.920 --> 03:50.280
We have this epistemological dominance of the scientific worldview and that dismisses

03:50.280 --> 03:54.600
other points of view, whether it's shamanism or it's, you know, mystical view from the

03:54.600 --> 03:57.440
Eastern traditions or even the Western religions.

03:57.440 --> 04:02.800
And so I believe simulation theory gives us at least a framework where we can combine

04:02.800 --> 04:08.200
these different worldviews, but also understand them both as different aspects of the search

04:08.200 --> 04:09.900
for truth.

04:09.900 --> 04:13.720
And it's one of the few frameworks I've come across where I can talk about it with people

04:13.720 --> 04:18.880
that are PhDs in science and with technologists in Silicon Valley, but also with Buddhist

04:18.880 --> 04:24.200
monks and people that are, you know, adherence to a particular religion as well.

04:24.200 --> 04:29.280
And so there are very few topics that you can kind of universally talk about and it's

04:29.280 --> 04:31.680
a framework that lets us to do that.

04:31.680 --> 04:36.760
You might say it's an interactional or translational framework in a way, because it translates

04:36.760 --> 04:41.920
language of one into language that the other can understand and actually agree with.

04:41.920 --> 04:47.880
This scientific and academic orthodoxy that we're dealing with right now, would you say

04:47.880 --> 04:54.040
that science has turned into scientism and a lot of scientists have turned into priests

04:54.040 --> 04:59.240
and basically the entire approach had turned into a religion and religious ideological

04:59.240 --> 05:06.000
kind of an approach rather than scientific curiosity that, you know, science is never

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
settled.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.560
It's not perfectly part of the nature of science to challenge ideas and to have debate and

05:13.560 --> 05:20.400
conversation about it, but we seem to be dealing with people who are more of a bureaucrats

05:20.400 --> 05:26.480
than people like Carl Sagan, for example, people who are politicians and not really

05:26.480 --> 05:31.560
interested in, as you're saying, finding or at least attempting to finding the nature

05:31.560 --> 05:33.560
of reality.

05:33.560 --> 05:42.560
Yeah, I think very much that, you know, science has turned into this, what is called scientism

05:42.560 --> 05:49.120
sometimes, and it's this idea that our way of knowing is the only way of knowing and

05:49.120 --> 05:56.360
if we haven't endorsed it, if our priests or our members of our community haven't reached

05:56.360 --> 05:57.360
a consensus.

05:57.360 --> 06:02.280
Now, it's obviously not the same as existing religions, but there is this element, you

06:02.280 --> 06:08.400
know, part of what I'm doing now is I'm actually studying the history of science and technology

06:08.400 --> 06:14.920
at ASU, working on a PhD, which I just started actually, and we're looking at the social

06:14.920 --> 06:16.240
construction of science.

06:16.240 --> 06:22.480
And so there used to be a point of view, particularly in for much of the 20th century, that scientists

06:22.480 --> 06:27.080
have access to the truth and nobody else has access to the truth.

06:27.080 --> 06:33.320
And when you kind of open the box and look in a little bit and you see, well, what does

06:33.320 --> 06:34.440
that mean?

06:34.440 --> 06:35.720
How is science constructed?

06:35.720 --> 06:40.440
You realize that it's a socially constructed thing in that there are different ways of

06:40.440 --> 06:41.440
looking at things.

06:41.440 --> 06:45.680
There are different ways of funding different types of experiments, and so which experiments

06:45.680 --> 06:49.560
get funded and which get taken seriously.

06:49.560 --> 06:53.920
And there's something called boundary work, where it's kind of pushing back on other areas

06:53.920 --> 06:59.880
of knowledge to say that's not science, therefore we're not going to take that seriously.

06:59.880 --> 07:03.760
And so you've seen a concerted effort to do this.

07:03.760 --> 07:08.360
And so as I said, it was kind of a response to the dominance of the other side in the

07:08.360 --> 07:14.740
past, but now we've gone too far, I think, in the direction of science where other ways

07:14.740 --> 07:20.540
of knowing and other realities and even anecdotal examples are pushed out.

07:20.540 --> 07:26.680
For example, people used to report seeing rocks fall from the sky back before the 1800s,

07:26.680 --> 07:30.840
but the scientists in Europe said, well, that's ridiculous, because there are no rocks in

07:30.840 --> 07:31.840
the sky.

07:31.840 --> 07:36.280
Therefore, we are going to assume that you're lying or you're crazy or misinformed, and

07:36.280 --> 07:42.400
you see that same attitude, for example, with UFO reports, which are very anecdotal.

07:42.400 --> 07:49.040
And only recently now we're starting to see people like Avi Loeb at Harvard, who was the

07:49.040 --> 07:52.720
previous head of the astronomy department, who are trying to create a real scientific

07:52.720 --> 07:54.120
effort to study.

07:54.120 --> 07:59.960
And so I think too often the priorities in science are not necessarily driven by curiosity

07:59.960 --> 08:04.680
about the world, but how to advance the specific set of knowledge, the kind of this edifice

08:04.680 --> 08:10.520
that we've built without going back and reexamining that maybe there's parts of this edifice in

08:10.520 --> 08:14.760
the foundation that aren't quite right and that there are holes in that.

08:14.760 --> 08:20.240
And that's what many of these anomalous experiences are showing us, is that our cosmological model

08:20.240 --> 08:25.040
of the world, just like before, we didn't know there were asteroids beyond Earth, therefore

08:25.040 --> 08:28.800
they couldn't fall to Earth.

08:28.800 --> 08:29.800
Same thing here.

08:29.800 --> 08:34.040
We don't acknowledge that there are any other realities beyond the physical, therefore we

08:34.040 --> 08:39.700
can't conceive that any such thing like a shaman having a non-ordinary reality experience

08:39.700 --> 08:41.680
could be a real experience, right?

08:41.680 --> 08:44.880
That's just put into the realm of psychology and imagination.

08:44.880 --> 08:51.000
So when you're saying this so-called scientism is not the same as religion, I totally agree.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.960
But like your book, it seems like scientism is a sequel to conventional religions, which

08:56.960 --> 09:03.640
hints, at least to me, to something much deeper within human nature, that we need religions,

09:03.640 --> 09:13.080
we need this superior kind of an authority in order to set some kind of a point of alignment

09:13.080 --> 09:18.720
for the collective of humanity to move towards, to strive towards, perhaps.

09:18.720 --> 09:26.680
Right, and I think that may be a human need, it may be a social need of the way in which

09:26.680 --> 09:34.600
our societies are constructed, right, because we now share communication much more freely

09:34.600 --> 09:39.560
than we did in the past, and so we've got large groups of people that are part of, say,

09:39.560 --> 09:43.320
a nation-state that are looking to the government, for example.

09:43.320 --> 09:50.880
And so I think that's true, that there is a need for people to look to authority, and

09:50.880 --> 09:58.440
you'll see these statements, well, you either trust science or you don't trust science.

09:58.440 --> 10:02.760
And the more you look at it, you realize that for people that are in the know, that's not

10:02.760 --> 10:04.080
that simple, right?

10:04.080 --> 10:08.280
Scientists, true scientists, will never make these grandiose statements, right?

10:08.280 --> 10:13.100
They will go in and make very specific statements about very specific experiments.

10:13.100 --> 10:16.980
And that's all, if you read the scientific papers, that's all they're allowed to say.

10:16.980 --> 10:23.160
But then when you translate that to the public, it becomes this broader understanding of everything

10:23.160 --> 10:28.000
else is ridiculous, homeopathy doesn't work, we know it doesn't work, therefore everyone

10:28.000 --> 10:29.640
who does it is a fraud, right?

10:29.640 --> 10:37.080
So you get into those kinds of, I think, not just statements, but also you have a general

10:37.080 --> 10:39.440
public that's looking for that authority.

10:39.440 --> 10:45.080
Because most people want to believe what's told to them either in the media or by authority,

10:45.080 --> 10:46.080
and then they repeat that.

10:46.080 --> 10:50.000
And with social media, we have that happening ad infinitum, right?

10:50.000 --> 10:54.680
So you have people repeating the same arguments that they've heard somewhere else.

10:54.680 --> 10:58.280
There are very few people who actually might know the underlying scientific data or the

10:58.280 --> 10:59.280
facts.

10:59.280 --> 11:05.120
But this issue of who gets credibility and who doesn't is an interesting one.

11:05.120 --> 11:06.760
And you can study that.

11:06.760 --> 11:11.800
And within the scientific circles, there is a lot of effort to try to keep certain people

11:11.800 --> 11:12.800
out of that.

11:12.800 --> 11:19.680
A good example is the honeybees, right, what they call colony collapse disorder.

11:19.680 --> 11:23.760
Many of the beekeepers say, well, it may have something to do with all these pesticides,

11:23.760 --> 11:27.200
and they've had intuitions about it because they're seeing different movements of the

11:27.200 --> 11:28.200
bees.

11:28.200 --> 11:32.840
But the way that science has framed the issue of a particular pesticide is they will do

11:32.840 --> 11:37.920
an experiment on a single pesticide, and if it doesn't cause a problem above a certain

11:37.920 --> 11:40.000
threshold, that's considered safe.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.680
They're not necessarily testing a whole bunch of these different things together.

11:43.680 --> 11:48.520
And as such, they're trying to exclude the expertise of the beekeepers, for example,

11:48.520 --> 11:53.800
when in fact they should be recognizing that there is some expertise here that comes from

11:53.800 --> 12:00.040
a different kind of experience that should have a credibility in the debate as well.

12:00.040 --> 12:01.680
So I definitely think that's there.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.240
Now, that's not to say that science can't continue to improve.

12:04.240 --> 12:07.680
I mentioned Avi Loeb and investigating UFOs.

12:07.680 --> 12:11.680
That was an area that was considered, you know, stigmatized.

12:11.680 --> 12:14.880
No one would do that at a respectable university for a while.

12:14.880 --> 12:16.840
And now it's starting to open up.

12:16.840 --> 12:22.360
And so you can see that even science evolves over time, mind, body, you know, connection

12:22.360 --> 12:25.520
with meditation, reducing stress, leading to health benefits.

12:25.520 --> 12:30.080
It's something that doctors 50 years ago would have said, yeah, you know, do it if you like,

12:30.080 --> 12:32.400
but it's not going to help you.

12:32.400 --> 12:36.600
And most doctors still have that attitude, but there has been enough research now to

12:36.600 --> 12:41.320
suggest that doing yoga, doing meditation, these things to improve health, even if we

12:41.320 --> 12:44.520
don't always understand the exact mechanism why.

12:44.520 --> 12:48.400
How would you assess Google's perspective and approach within this context?

12:48.400 --> 12:56.000
Because Google and YouTube, you know, their approach have been criticized and quite justly

12:56.000 --> 13:00.720
because they're ranking based on their own, you know, preference and biases.

13:00.720 --> 13:07.640
They're in many cases changing search results in order to, you know, direct people towards

13:07.640 --> 13:09.520
a certain kind of outcome.

13:09.520 --> 13:15.480
When you talk to them about this kind of thing and your book, how do they respond?

13:15.480 --> 13:16.760
What are they thinking?

13:16.760 --> 13:20.680
Because Google, I think, is even more important to talk about than a lot of governments considering

13:20.680 --> 13:26.380
the amount of technological might and power that is under their control.

13:26.380 --> 13:31.480
And they don't have checks and balances that, let's say, the American system, for example,

13:31.480 --> 13:33.600
has embedded within it.

13:33.600 --> 13:38.240
Yeah, well, you know, what I find is that, you know, people at Google, and I just gave

13:38.240 --> 13:43.440
a talk there a few weeks ago, you know, they're pretty open to this idea of the simulation

13:43.440 --> 13:48.800
hypothesis and this idea that there's computation underlying the physical universe.

13:48.800 --> 13:53.020
And that's because they're coming at it from the point of view of computer science being

13:53.020 --> 13:55.020
a software company.

13:55.020 --> 13:58.080
So I think from that perspective, they're very open minded.

13:58.080 --> 14:02.960
Yet, if you look at my talk at Google, my first one, you know, at the end, I was talking

14:02.960 --> 14:06.160
about the matrix and a spoon being bent.

14:06.160 --> 14:09.560
And I showed them some pictures from a spoon bending party that had just taken place in

14:09.560 --> 14:12.680
Santa Clara, like the week before.

14:12.680 --> 14:15.280
And they all started like, what is this guy doing?

14:15.280 --> 14:17.300
He's showing us pictures of spoon bending?

14:17.300 --> 14:18.540
We know that's false.

14:18.540 --> 14:22.540
We know that doesn't happen, right, without examining their own beliefs of, well, why

14:22.540 --> 14:23.820
do they believe it's false?

14:23.820 --> 14:25.120
Because they heard it in the media.

14:25.120 --> 14:27.320
They heard that it was discredited long ago, right?

14:27.320 --> 14:28.320
Do they have any experience?

14:28.320 --> 14:32.320
Have any of them ever gone to a spoon bending party?

14:32.320 --> 14:33.320
Absolutely not.

14:33.320 --> 14:34.400
So you definitely have a lot of that.

14:34.400 --> 14:38.340
But I think what's happened is, you know, in the same way, if we went back 50 years,

14:38.340 --> 14:44.240
there were primarily three networks with the news that was disseminated or broadcast and

14:44.240 --> 14:46.600
you had to tune in at six or 11.

14:46.600 --> 14:47.600
And that was it.

14:47.600 --> 14:48.600
That was all you got, right?

14:48.600 --> 14:49.720
And then there were certain newspapers.

14:49.720 --> 14:54.960
And if you look at the history of that, you realize there was government priorities.

14:54.960 --> 14:59.520
There were social priorities and there were priorities of the government that impacted

14:59.520 --> 15:01.240
the media.

15:01.240 --> 15:05.720
But because they became so pervasive, they were regulated in a certain way.

15:05.720 --> 15:07.560
And so only certain stories made it out.

15:07.560 --> 15:13.000
Now what's happened with Facebook and Google in particular and YouTube is they've gotten

15:13.000 --> 15:17.760
so big that now you have the intersection of politics with technology, right?

15:17.760 --> 15:23.080
It's no longer just about, you know, what does the technology say and the politics.

15:23.080 --> 15:26.920
And so science is sort of informing, you know, a lot of that.

15:26.920 --> 15:30.040
But also, so are the priorities.

15:30.040 --> 15:35.960
And so because, for example, we've been in the middle of a pandemic, right, you see all

15:35.960 --> 15:41.280
kinds of efforts within YouTube to basically ban anything that mentions any kind of, you

15:41.280 --> 15:49.240
know, paranormal phenomenon, as opposed to because of the priorities of the society in

15:49.240 --> 15:51.480
this case is, hey, we got to get out of this pandemic.

15:51.480 --> 15:52.480
How do we do that?

15:52.480 --> 15:55.120
And so not that I want to get too much into a debate on that.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.640
It's kind of far and field from my work.

15:56.640 --> 16:04.640
But I think you do get, you know, priorities that are set both by society and in terms

16:04.640 --> 16:09.520
of what people are worried about and political intervention that we may not even know about.

16:09.520 --> 16:14.600
So we may not even know about some of the discussions that have been going on to set

16:14.600 --> 16:20.440
priorities and to decide what is acceptable knowledge and what is not acceptable knowledge.

16:20.440 --> 16:25.720
And to me, you know, that's where I find that bringing in this idea of the metaphor

16:25.720 --> 16:30.560
of a video game or an interactive video game, suddenly people who are hardcore atheists

16:30.560 --> 16:36.240
say, well, I can see that beings from outside the simulation would look to us as if they

16:36.240 --> 16:40.400
were supernatural because they have powers that we don't have and they have the ability

16:40.400 --> 16:45.520
to control events and just as programmers can or super users can within video games.

16:45.520 --> 16:49.240
And so I think there there may be ways to bridge this gap because it's been getting

16:49.240 --> 16:50.860
wider and wider.

16:50.860 --> 16:55.000
But that's part of my work, I think, and the reason I wrote these two books is to provide

16:55.000 --> 17:00.200
a technological framework that says reality may be more complicated than what we think

17:00.200 --> 17:01.200
it is.

17:01.200 --> 17:02.200
Absolutely.

17:02.200 --> 17:03.800
I had Jason Reza Georgiani on the show.

17:03.800 --> 17:04.800
I don't know if you know him.

17:04.800 --> 17:12.540
He has a new book, Closer Encounters, PhD professor, very well known, very controversial.

17:12.540 --> 17:19.520
And his thesis is also that aliens are actually humans who at some point they discovered time

17:19.520 --> 17:24.760
traveling capability and they're changing the timelines of our experience from the fifth

17:24.760 --> 17:25.920
dimension.

17:25.920 --> 17:30.160
And when I was going through your book, I'm like, holy shit, you basically are talking

17:30.160 --> 17:32.360
about the same thing.

17:32.360 --> 17:35.840
And he's getting mocked and ridiculed because of it.

17:35.840 --> 17:40.040
And I'm sure you have come across a lot of people like, you just don't know what you're

17:40.040 --> 17:41.040
talking about.

17:41.040 --> 17:48.640
But more and more as we digitizing our reality, it seems like it is a completely feasible

17:48.640 --> 17:51.520
at least possibility that we have to consider.

17:51.520 --> 17:52.520
Yeah.

17:52.520 --> 17:57.720
And I mean, I've heard of him, but I haven't read his book, so I didn't know about that

17:57.720 --> 17:58.720
specific argument.

17:58.720 --> 18:07.440
But yeah, I mean, I find that if I frame the discussion in terms of language and computer

18:07.440 --> 18:12.600
science and information science, and you can tie that to the physics, because what's happening

18:12.600 --> 18:20.520
in physics is over time, I think they're realizing that the physical world doesn't really exist.

18:20.520 --> 18:24.480
And we might have talked about this last time, but there was John Wheeler, who was one of

18:24.480 --> 18:27.200
the famous physicists of the 20th century at Princeton.

18:27.200 --> 18:30.480
He worked with Einstein and with Bohr.

18:30.480 --> 18:34.040
And he was the supervisor of Hugh Everett, who came up with a quantum multiverse idea,

18:34.040 --> 18:35.840
which we can talk about in a minute.

18:35.840 --> 18:41.000
But he came to the conclusion that physics went through three stages in his lifetime

18:41.000 --> 18:42.340
in the 20th century.

18:42.340 --> 18:44.200
It went from everything is a particle, right?

18:44.200 --> 18:50.120
This is the old view of the Greeks that an atom is the smallest physical object, and

18:50.120 --> 18:55.520
you just put them together, to everything is a field of probability, to the conclusion

18:55.520 --> 19:01.160
that he came to, the only thing that defines a particle is a series of yes, no questions,

19:01.160 --> 19:02.160
answers.

19:02.160 --> 19:03.960
And those are bits of information.

19:03.960 --> 19:06.320
I mean, that is exactly what a bit is.

19:06.320 --> 19:07.800
It's a one or a zero.

19:07.800 --> 19:12.440
And if you want to distinguish one particle from another, the only thing to distinguish

19:12.440 --> 19:15.160
it are these kind of bits of information.

19:15.160 --> 19:17.760
And so he came up with the phrase, it from bit.

19:17.760 --> 19:22.240
So anything that seems like an it, like a physical object, like your microphone or my

19:22.240 --> 19:27.520
computer or this table, right, is actually composed of bits of information.

19:27.520 --> 19:31.480
And so I find that, you know, there's more agreement on that even today than there was,

19:31.480 --> 19:36.180
you know, when he made that statement, which was back in the 80s, I think, when he came

19:36.180 --> 19:37.840
up with that statement.

19:37.840 --> 19:41.160
Today, you know, there's this area of digital physics, right?

19:41.160 --> 19:45.200
In physics, we always talk about the conservation of matter or of energy.

19:45.200 --> 19:50.000
Now there's an area where they're looking at the conservation of information, like how

19:50.000 --> 19:53.220
much information is in the universe, which is represented by bits.

19:53.220 --> 19:59.440
If you look at biology, the idea of a gene and DNA, it's really just a compact representation

19:59.440 --> 20:05.200
of bits of information when then algorithms that you have for refining that information

20:05.200 --> 20:06.280
and running it.

20:06.280 --> 20:11.960
And so, you know, the conclusion that I came to was that the universe is a process that

20:11.960 --> 20:17.200
is computationally irreducible, which is a term that was defined by Stephen Wolfram,

20:17.200 --> 20:22.120
who created the Mathematica software and who was a physicist turned computer scientist.

20:22.120 --> 20:26.100
And what that meant was you couldn't just find out what's going to happen by solving

20:26.100 --> 20:27.480
a simple equation.

20:27.480 --> 20:29.560
You had to run the steps.

20:29.560 --> 20:34.880
So if you want to see what's going to happen in year 1000, you have to go run the simulation

20:34.880 --> 20:40.640
up to year 999, and then you have to run 365 days of it.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.720
And so, you know, millions of steps in the simulation.

20:43.720 --> 20:47.040
And then you will see exactly what happens at that point in time.

20:47.040 --> 20:52.380
And so, you know, I came to the conclusion that we may be living in this kind of a reality

20:52.380 --> 20:59.760
where time is being run forward and then it's being rewound and can be rerun again.

20:59.760 --> 21:05.440
Now, that makes no sense if you have a model of there's one timeline that goes from the

21:05.440 --> 21:08.260
past to the future and there's one physical world.

21:08.260 --> 21:11.760
So my previous book, The Simulation Hypothesis, was telling us the physical world is not what

21:11.760 --> 21:12.760
we think it is.

21:12.760 --> 21:15.220
It is mostly based on information.

21:15.220 --> 21:20.020
This book is kind of about the fact that time is not what we think it is.

21:20.020 --> 21:24.040
What we think of the future and the past are not the same.

21:24.040 --> 21:29.000
And I talk about the delayed choice experiment, which was a thought experiment that John Wheeler,

21:29.000 --> 21:33.440
who I just mentioned, came up with, you know, back in like the 60s, and it has to do with

21:33.440 --> 21:36.520
the double slit experiment and with Schrodinger's cat.

21:36.520 --> 21:41.100
And the whole idea is that the cat, we would think it's either alive or dead.

21:41.100 --> 21:46.720
But within this thought experiment, quantum mechanics says the cat is in superposition

21:46.720 --> 21:52.440
until we observe it and measure it, which means that it is both alive and dead.

21:52.440 --> 21:53.440
Now that sounds ridiculous.

21:53.440 --> 21:56.600
And even Schrodinger came up with the example because he said that sounds ridiculous.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.160
It can't be both.

21:58.160 --> 22:03.200
But even Schrodinger back in the 40s realized that quantum mechanics was telling us something

22:03.200 --> 22:09.400
weird that there are what he called multiple simultaneous histories, right?

22:09.400 --> 22:12.800
And the delayed choice experiment is a good way to think about this because if you think

22:12.800 --> 22:17.040
of the cosmic version of it, we have, say, a quasar that is a billion light years away

22:17.040 --> 22:23.040
sending us a light, and we have a gravitationally large object like a black hole or a galaxy

22:23.040 --> 22:27.080
in the middle, and the light can go to the left or to the right, and we can have telescopes

22:27.080 --> 22:31.400
here on Earth that can figure out, you know, which way did the light go because it will

22:31.400 --> 22:34.320
just pick up the one that went left or the one that went right.

22:34.320 --> 22:38.200
Now if that black hole is a million light years from us and the quasar is a billion

22:38.200 --> 22:42.760
light years from us, when does the decision about whether to go left or right, you know,

22:42.760 --> 22:44.040
when is that decision made?

22:44.040 --> 22:47.640
It has to be made a million years ago because for the light to get here, it would take it

22:47.640 --> 22:49.040
a million years.

22:49.040 --> 22:53.460
But what the delayed choice experiment is telling us is it's not until we measure the

22:53.460 --> 23:00.400
light here on Earth in the present that one of those possible pasts is chosen.

23:00.400 --> 23:05.920
So this gets into just a strange idea about, you know, what is the past?

23:05.920 --> 23:09.200
What does it mean for something to have happened, right?

23:09.200 --> 23:14.760
And again, it seems nonsensical unless you start to think about a graph of possibilities

23:14.760 --> 23:19.720
that shows all the different timelines, both going backwards and forward from the current

23:19.720 --> 23:20.960
point in time.

23:20.960 --> 23:24.040
And in this book, that is what I call the multiverse graph.

23:24.040 --> 23:28.480
And in the simulated model, it makes more sense because what it means that something

23:28.480 --> 23:34.880
happened just means that we are rendering that specific pathway through the multiverse

23:34.880 --> 23:36.600
graph.

23:36.600 --> 23:38.480
And I talked a little bit about this last time as well.

23:38.480 --> 23:45.560
The reason we can create these very expansive 3D virtual worlds and MMORPGs like World of

23:45.560 --> 23:50.680
Warcraft or Fortnite, where my avatar and your avatar are hanging out and we're walking

23:50.680 --> 23:53.060
around and shooting at other people.

23:53.060 --> 23:54.680
Back in the 80s, you couldn't do that.

23:54.680 --> 23:56.360
You couldn't create games like that.

23:56.360 --> 23:59.440
And you might say, well, we didn't have enough processing power, but we also didn't know

23:59.440 --> 24:01.720
how to keep track of all those pixels.

24:01.720 --> 24:05.680
And so what happened between then and now is we learned optimization techniques that

24:05.680 --> 24:10.840
said render only that which is observed by your avatar.

24:10.840 --> 24:15.720
And so we only rendered the particular probability or possibility that needs to be shown and

24:15.720 --> 24:18.080
only that which can be seen.

24:18.080 --> 24:22.160
And so the golden rule within video games is render only that which is observed.

24:22.160 --> 24:25.600
Turns out that's the same golden rule that quantum mechanics is telling us.

24:25.600 --> 24:28.000
We only render that which is observed.

24:28.000 --> 24:34.240
And if you think of that, all the possibilities as being this giant graph of timelines, and

24:34.240 --> 24:36.280
that's really what the quantum multiverse is all about.

24:36.280 --> 24:39.800
It's about different choices and different timelines.

24:39.800 --> 24:44.560
Then that gives us a new and interesting way to think about it, which I call the simulated

24:44.560 --> 24:45.560
multiverse.

24:45.560 --> 24:48.560
Can I read you a poem?

24:48.560 --> 24:49.560
Sure.

24:49.560 --> 24:50.560
Absolutely.

24:50.560 --> 24:59.400
It's called Infinite Parallel Universes, universes, parallel, infinite, all here, slightly different

24:59.400 --> 25:07.120
like radio waves, tune in with a choice, tune out with a choice, each choice a path to live

25:07.120 --> 25:17.960
the consequences, each path a chance, slightly different, all here, infinite, parallel universes.

25:17.960 --> 25:18.960
That's great.

25:18.960 --> 25:23.080
That's very much along the same ideas that I've been writing about.

25:23.080 --> 25:26.760
Is that a poem that you wrote or one that you found?

25:26.760 --> 25:33.440
Last June, I woke up in a, I don't want to promote my book, but I would love to send

25:33.440 --> 25:35.080
you a copy.

25:35.080 --> 25:42.360
I woke up for like three weeks and right when I woke up, a poem came to my head, just like

25:42.360 --> 25:44.840
in an instant and I wrote it and it was gone.

25:44.840 --> 25:49.320
I had no other poems, like I didn't think I was a poet or anything like that.

25:49.320 --> 25:50.680
And then there were 22 of them.

25:50.680 --> 25:52.720
I think there were like 19 of them actually.

25:52.720 --> 25:56.920
I had two from before, I kind of revised them and made them into a book.

25:56.920 --> 26:05.600
As I said, I would love to send you a copy, but it seems like exactly what you're talking

26:05.600 --> 26:08.600
about.

26:08.600 --> 26:09.600
Yeah very much.

26:09.600 --> 26:15.480
There's a great story that I mentioned in the book from like the early 20th century

26:15.480 --> 26:21.640
called The Garden of Forking Paths by Jorge Luis Borges, who I think was a South American

26:21.640 --> 26:25.600
writer that I think is very, very related to what you wrote there.

26:25.600 --> 26:31.440
So it may be something that you want to check out, but in The Garden of Forking Paths, it's

26:31.440 --> 26:36.680
about a labyrinth in which all men will lose their way and an ancient Chinese writer who

26:36.680 --> 26:40.440
wrote this book and they couldn't quite figure out what he was writing because it didn't

26:40.440 --> 26:41.440
make any sense.

26:41.440 --> 26:44.760
There were all these different possibilities and stuff and you have a scientist who kind

26:44.760 --> 26:50.760
of figures that out in the present and he says that the Garden of Forking Paths is a

26:50.760 --> 26:57.160
picture, incomplete yet not false, of the universe such as this particular Chinese ancestor

26:57.160 --> 27:02.960
of the person talking conceived it to be different, differing from Newton and Schopenhauer.

27:02.960 --> 27:06.040
Your ancestor did not think of time as absolute and uniform.

27:06.040 --> 27:10.680
He believed in an infinite series of times in a dizzily growing, ever-spreading network

27:10.680 --> 27:14.360
of diverging, converging and parallel times.

27:14.360 --> 27:19.120
This web of time, the strands of which approach one another, bifurcate, intersect or ignore

27:19.120 --> 27:23.140
each other through the centuries, embraces every possibility.

27:23.140 --> 27:25.360
And so I quote that in the simulated multiverse.

27:25.360 --> 27:26.800
So yeah, I'd be happy to take a look.

27:26.800 --> 27:30.320
I think your poem is a great example of exactly that.

27:30.320 --> 27:37.080
Yeah, this really is a convergence of everything that humanity has been developing and figuring

27:37.080 --> 27:43.000
out and dreaming and imagining, which begs the question, are we digitizing the world

27:43.000 --> 27:50.520
or are we just unveiling the world that is already digital at its core and at its nature?

27:50.520 --> 27:57.560
Because it seems like, sorry to jump when you were...

27:57.560 --> 28:05.800
We are building the metaverse now, and metaverse technically has the potential to simulate

28:05.800 --> 28:10.040
this reality, but man-made, for lack of a better term.

28:10.040 --> 28:16.380
Now man is enhanced by technology, but it seems like the core of reality isn't that

28:16.380 --> 28:24.000
much of a difference from what we've been building towards, each part being a sequel

28:24.000 --> 28:31.200
to the previous part, all building towards this ultimate discovery of the world that

28:31.200 --> 28:32.200
is digital.

28:32.200 --> 28:37.000
Yeah, I mean, I think you're on the right track there.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.520
So there's a lot of talk about the metaverse these days, and Facebook changed its name

28:41.520 --> 28:50.120
as a company to Meta to show how important the metaverse is going to be to its future.

28:50.120 --> 28:54.080
And so some people say, well, that's just to get away from all the negative press, the

28:54.080 --> 28:58.800
social media, but Zuckerberg has been interested in this idea of the metaverse, which comes

28:58.800 --> 29:07.360
from a 1992 science fiction novel called Snow Crash by a cyberpunk type of novel by Neil

29:07.360 --> 29:08.840
Stevenson.

29:08.840 --> 29:14.400
And so the metaverse is very much about building virtual worlds, and there are what I call

29:14.400 --> 29:15.840
the threads of the metaverse.

29:15.840 --> 29:21.120
And one of those threads is sort of mirroring the physical world in the digital world.

29:21.120 --> 29:26.300
And how I got interested in simulation theory is actually along these lines.

29:26.300 --> 29:30.460
So back in 2016, I was visiting a startup that was doing virtual reality, and I put

29:30.460 --> 29:34.480
on the headset and I started to play ping pong.

29:34.480 --> 29:40.320
And it was so realistic in the responsiveness that for a moment I forgot that I was in virtual

29:40.320 --> 29:45.840
reality, and I tried to put the paddle down on the table and I tried to lean against the

29:45.840 --> 29:50.040
table just like I might do at the end of an actual table tennis game.

29:50.040 --> 29:53.680
And of course, to paraphrase the matrix, there is no table.

29:53.680 --> 29:57.400
So the controller fell to the floor and I almost fell over.

29:57.400 --> 30:01.740
And that's when I started to realize that eventually our virtual reality will get so

30:01.740 --> 30:04.000
good that it'll be indistinguishable.

30:04.000 --> 30:09.140
And I call that point the simulation point, at the point where we can build something

30:09.140 --> 30:11.160
like the matrix ourselves.

30:11.160 --> 30:15.400
And so I laid out the 10 stages of technology that we would have to get there, and it turns

30:15.400 --> 30:18.040
out these are very related to the metaverse, right?

30:18.040 --> 30:23.160
So the metaverse is we're building it today is in kind of the stages that we're at on

30:23.160 --> 30:25.880
the road to the simulation point.

30:25.880 --> 30:31.720
So enhanced AR and VR, also, you know, we are starting to discover augmented reality

30:31.720 --> 30:37.600
where we can place digital objects in the world around us, which eventually we will

30:37.600 --> 30:41.620
be able to do this without the glasses, using light field technology.

30:41.620 --> 30:45.120
So we're blurring the line between what is digital and what is physical.

30:45.120 --> 30:48.800
I call that, you know, the holodeck scenario, right, where we would be able to walk into

30:48.800 --> 30:50.840
a room and see things that aren't there.

30:50.840 --> 30:52.720
But to us, it would seem like they are.

30:52.720 --> 30:57.080
And similarly, our 3D printers are getting so good that they can start to print things

30:57.080 --> 31:02.440
out like in Star Trek, the next generation, you know, when Captain Picard used to go and

31:02.440 --> 31:06.440
say tea, Earl Grey hot, and the replicator would just create the cup and the tea.

31:06.440 --> 31:09.560
Now we're not quite there yet, but we can create the cup.

31:09.560 --> 31:14.040
We can actually 3D print cups now, but we can't necessarily, you know, in the same printer

31:14.040 --> 31:16.280
print the liquid, but eventually we'll get there.

31:16.280 --> 31:22.000
But then we get into this area of brain computer interfaces, right, where we can send in what

31:22.000 --> 31:27.560
is digital information into the brain and fool ourselves in the brain to not realize

31:27.560 --> 31:30.640
that where we are is a virtual digital world.

31:30.640 --> 31:37.440
And so that leads eventually to this simulation point where, you know, we are having an experience

31:37.440 --> 31:38.800
like the Matrix.

31:38.800 --> 31:43.720
And so when I started to research this area of simulation theory, I discovered Nick Bostrom,

31:43.720 --> 31:49.440
who is at Oxford, who basically said that if any civilization ever gets to that point,

31:49.440 --> 31:53.840
right, then we're already likely in a simulation because they'll be able to create so many

31:53.840 --> 31:55.200
different digital simulations.

31:55.200 --> 32:00.140
All you have to do is crank up another server that with infinite variety that we're more

32:00.140 --> 32:01.820
likely to be in one of those.

32:01.820 --> 32:09.640
And so I think that, you know, part of why the findings of quantum mechanics are so bizarre,

32:09.640 --> 32:14.480
right, Niels Bohr said, if you are not shocked by these findings, then you haven't understood

32:14.480 --> 32:19.560
quantum mechanics, right, is because we think we're in a physical world.

32:19.560 --> 32:24.600
And so very much if we can get there, and my conclusion is we can get there in 100,

32:24.600 --> 32:29.960
200 years where we can create, you know, these perfect digital replicas of what we think

32:29.960 --> 32:34.360
of as the physical world because we're starting to discover the algorithms, the procedural

32:34.360 --> 32:40.720
generation that's used in biology to generate, you know, flora and fauna, for example.

32:40.720 --> 32:45.400
There, you know, there are all kinds of algorithms, fractal, etc., that are starting to be able

32:45.400 --> 32:46.400
to replicate that.

32:46.400 --> 32:52.440
There was a game, a video game called No Man's Sky a few years ago, which had like 18 quintillion

32:52.440 --> 32:58.080
planets and each one had its own unique set of flora and fauna and animals because they

32:58.080 --> 33:03.640
can all be procedurally generated, which gets back to this idea that at its core, the universe

33:03.640 --> 33:10.320
may be more about information and optimizing the storage and transfer of that information

33:10.320 --> 33:14.800
than it is about physical objects, the way that we would think about them in common sense.

33:14.800 --> 33:20.460
So yeah, I mean, I think the metaverse is the stages which we would need to go through

33:20.460 --> 33:26.680
to get to that simulation point and then we would discover that not only can we totally

33:26.680 --> 33:34.080
reproduce the world in digital form, the world already has this underlying structure of digital

33:34.080 --> 33:40.120
information, which means we might already be in somebody else's simulation.

33:40.120 --> 33:48.600
Some people are completely freaked out by Facebook's attempt to build a metaverse because,

33:48.600 --> 33:55.440
and I think it's well-funded that Zuckerberg wants to play the role of God, basically.

33:55.440 --> 34:03.160
He wants to be the creator of this world, that it can expand to physical world and every

34:03.160 --> 34:04.720
aspect of our lives, basically.

34:04.720 --> 34:10.920
So it seems like centralization versus decentralization is something that philosophically we always

34:10.920 --> 34:16.780
have talked about, but now we have the technological tool to democratize that decentralization

34:16.780 --> 34:20.400
in order to build this kind of thing, which is another reason that I'm thinking maybe

34:20.400 --> 34:26.560
this whole thing, if there is a purpose for humanity, maybe the purpose is to figure out

34:26.560 --> 34:32.600
this digital nature of reality and all of these steps seem like they totally make sense

34:32.600 --> 34:33.720
to get there.

34:33.720 --> 34:40.320
But beyond that, which I would love to hear your comments with respect to a form of governance

34:40.320 --> 34:44.640
that we need moving forward, dealing with this kind of a possibility that everybody

34:44.640 --> 34:49.960
will be able to basically create their own reality, you know, at first in VR, but then

34:49.960 --> 34:53.680
in AR and mixed reality, right?

34:53.680 --> 35:00.000
But also, how can we ever get to truly recognize and understand the nature of reality, which

35:00.000 --> 35:05.200
is quantum, while our experience is binary?

35:05.200 --> 35:10.600
Well, so there was a lot there that you mentioned.

35:10.600 --> 35:15.720
And so, you know, starting with the first part, and Zuckerberg and Facebook trying to

35:15.720 --> 35:21.520
dominate the metaverse, and, you know, I think that, you know, they're still operating on

35:21.520 --> 35:27.880
a slightly older imaginary, which is a term that's used in academia, social technical

35:27.880 --> 35:32.960
imaginary for how science fiction might represent what could happen in the future.

35:32.960 --> 35:36.840
And when we talk about the metaverse, you know, we're also talking about the imaginaries

35:36.840 --> 35:42.200
that we buy into, whether it's Snow Crash, or Ready Player One, which came out a few

35:42.200 --> 35:46.020
years ago, where everyone put on the virtual reality headsets.

35:46.020 --> 35:50.720
And they use that to go to school, they use that to go to work for relationships to explore

35:50.720 --> 35:54.280
the world, and became the most valuable company in the world.

35:54.280 --> 35:58.920
And, you know, I think, you know, Zuckerberg is operating off of that imaginary, because

35:58.920 --> 36:02.360
he wants to be the company that controls all of that.

36:02.360 --> 36:07.000
But technology has a way of innovating and catching up, and sometimes surpassing the

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
old imaginaries.

36:08.000 --> 36:14.160
You know, if we look, go back to William Gibson's, you know, Neuromancer, where he defined the

36:14.160 --> 36:18.200
term cyberspace, right, it's the internet has evolved very differently from that.

36:18.200 --> 36:21.860
And even Snow Crash, the metaverse has evolved differently from that.

36:21.860 --> 36:27.080
And so today, we have a decentralization mechanism called the blockchain, right, which lets us

36:27.080 --> 36:34.000
have digital assets that are owned by individuals that are not necessarily owned by, you know,

36:34.000 --> 36:39.560
just one company, and portability of those digital assets in between different places

36:39.560 --> 36:41.040
of the metaverse.

36:41.040 --> 36:45.240
And so I think one of the most interesting trends in the metaverse is, in fact, this

36:45.240 --> 36:51.560
idea that we will have portable digital identities, avatars that we can take into different virtual

36:51.560 --> 36:58.840
environments, but also that we can own objects and reuse them in different parts.

36:58.840 --> 37:05.480
And so I think that this emergence of blockchain and NFT and cryptocurrency is very interesting,

37:05.480 --> 37:10.120
because it provides a counterpoint to the imaginary where one company is controlling

37:10.120 --> 37:11.120
everything.

37:11.120 --> 37:15.300
It lets individual content creators create things and then sell those things.

37:15.300 --> 37:16.560
And so it creates a whole economy.

37:16.560 --> 37:22.120
Now, what we have today, which we didn't have in the previous iterations of the metaverse,

37:22.120 --> 37:31.440
if you go back 10, 15 years to Second Life, you know, was that we didn't, one, most people

37:31.440 --> 37:34.680
in our society were not used to being avatars.

37:34.680 --> 37:39.920
Of course, now most younger people today are used to being avatars in games, and are used

37:39.920 --> 37:43.560
to playing with their friends in the same way that, you know, in my case, when I was

37:43.560 --> 37:49.240
a kid, we'd go out to the park and play today, they'll, you know, bring their avatars in

37:49.240 --> 37:55.040
and go into Fortnite or some other digital representation as a way to hang out with their

37:55.040 --> 37:56.040
friends.

37:56.040 --> 37:59.920
But the digital economy didn't really exist in this way.

37:59.920 --> 38:02.640
It was just in a specific company.

38:02.640 --> 38:06.920
And so you could buy, you could create things and sell them for Linden dollars in Second

38:06.920 --> 38:07.920
Life.

38:07.920 --> 38:08.920
You could also have a job.

38:08.920 --> 38:12.680
And there were people who says, I need to be logged in at 11 p.m. because my job is

38:12.680 --> 38:13.680
a bartender.

38:13.680 --> 38:14.680
Yeah, countries opened up.

38:14.680 --> 38:15.680
In a virtual bar.

38:15.680 --> 38:18.160
Sorry, countries opened up embassies in Second Life.

38:18.160 --> 38:23.200
I remember Nike opened up the store in Second Life.

38:23.200 --> 38:24.200
That's right.

38:24.200 --> 38:25.200
Yes.

38:25.200 --> 38:28.640
And so the idea was this was going to be the metaverse, but it was kind of built by one

38:28.640 --> 38:34.000
company and the digital economy, you know, what underpinnings weren't there and not enough

38:34.000 --> 38:36.040
people took it up.

38:36.040 --> 38:41.680
And even Second Life itself ended up introducing open sourced versions of it because, you know,

38:41.680 --> 38:46.520
the power of the crowd is sometimes bigger than the power of a specific company.

38:46.520 --> 38:50.840
But what we have today with blockchain and Bitcoin and Ether and all the other blockchains

38:50.840 --> 38:55.720
that are out there is we have a medium of exchange that is not controlled, you know,

38:55.720 --> 38:57.920
by any central authority.

38:57.920 --> 39:01.200
And I think that is one of the reasons why, you know, governments have been afraid of

39:01.200 --> 39:04.120
Bitcoin and have been afraid of cryptocurrency.

39:04.120 --> 39:07.900
But now, you know, it's just kind of marched on to the point where it's big enough that

39:07.900 --> 39:10.600
it's hard for any one country.

39:10.600 --> 39:15.760
Like even China in 2013, you know, I started buying Bitcoin way back in the day.

39:15.760 --> 39:19.400
I used to go to like the Bank of America and take out one hundred dollars and give the

39:19.400 --> 39:24.720
cash to this other guy who would literally with his phone send me one Bitcoin outside.

39:24.720 --> 39:29.600
But in 2013, China, you know, did one of its many bans on Bitcoin.

39:29.600 --> 39:33.160
It's something that happens every few years now.

39:33.160 --> 39:36.240
And it caused a huge crash in the market.

39:36.240 --> 39:37.240
Now that just happened again.

39:37.240 --> 39:41.440
And it didn't cause such a huge crash in the market because enough people have bought into

39:41.440 --> 39:47.040
this idea of a decentralized medium of economic exchange.

39:47.040 --> 39:53.120
And so I think that's part of why I don't think just one company will end up controlling

39:53.120 --> 39:54.120
the metaverse.

39:54.120 --> 39:58.400
Now, there will be big players, of course, and Facebook wants to be one of those players.

39:58.400 --> 40:03.840
But usually, you know, when the Internet came about, Microsoft tried to crush Netscape and

40:03.840 --> 40:04.840
they did.

40:04.840 --> 40:07.800
They tried to crush Netscape to become the on-ramp of the Internet.

40:07.800 --> 40:08.960
But what happened?

40:08.960 --> 40:14.920
New companies like Google, Facebook and others came to dominate that medium.

40:14.920 --> 40:17.400
That always happens with technology cycles.

40:17.400 --> 40:21.480
So it may not be Facebook and Zuckerberg that we're talking about ten years from now on

40:21.480 --> 40:22.960
the metaverse.

40:22.960 --> 40:27.600
It may just end up being a whole new set of companies that are doing these kind of decentralized

40:27.600 --> 40:32.640
models of virtual ownership and exploring the metaverse.

40:32.640 --> 40:36.240
The second part of the question, if you remember, or you want me to repeat it, because I think

40:36.240 --> 40:37.240
that's something that...

40:37.240 --> 40:38.880
Yeah, why don't you repeat it?

40:38.880 --> 40:45.480
Just how can we possibly ever go on to understand, even recognize the true nature of reality,

40:45.480 --> 40:49.960
which is quantum, based on our binary experience of it?

40:49.960 --> 40:56.760
Yeah, that's a good question, obviously a big metaphysical question, right?

40:56.760 --> 41:07.640
And I believe that a metaphor for the universe of the video game is the best way to understand

41:07.640 --> 41:08.640
it.

41:08.640 --> 41:16.000
And if you go back in history, the models and the metaphors that are used are approximations

41:16.000 --> 41:17.880
of what reality might be like.

41:17.880 --> 41:23.120
In the religious traditions, in Buddhism, for example, the metaphor of the dream is

41:23.120 --> 41:25.280
used quite a bit.

41:25.280 --> 41:30.480
And in fact, the meaning of the word Buddha is to be awake, right?

41:30.480 --> 41:34.800
When somebody asked him, what are you, and he said, I am Buddha, meaning I am awake.

41:34.800 --> 41:37.440
Well, that implies that everybody else is asleep, right?

41:37.440 --> 41:42.880
And so the metaphor is a powerful one, and it's carried through for this idea that the

41:42.880 --> 41:45.280
world is Maya or illusion.

41:45.280 --> 41:51.800
But even to aspects of Tibetan Buddhism, where they have practices of dream yoga, where you

41:51.800 --> 41:57.640
learn to wake up within a dream, what we would call lucid dreaming today as a spiritual practice

41:57.640 --> 42:03.920
to try to understand the nature of reality, that it is all an illusion.

42:03.920 --> 42:06.240
And so that metaphor is very powerful.

42:06.240 --> 42:10.460
But another metaphor that was used back in the day in the Vedas, for example, is this

42:10.460 --> 42:14.240
idea of a stage play or a game play, right?

42:14.240 --> 42:19.720
The lila of the gods, the world is the lila of the gods, and we're all playing roles.

42:19.720 --> 42:25.200
And even Shakespeare 500 years ago used that metaphor when he said all the world's a stage,

42:25.200 --> 42:27.400
and the men and women are merely players.

42:27.400 --> 42:34.240
And then if you go back 100 years, Yogananda, who wrote Autobiography of a Yogi, which is

42:34.240 --> 42:37.920
one of the most popular spiritual books of the 20th century, at least in the West, and

42:37.920 --> 42:45.160
he came over after World War I from India to the US, and he used a more up-to-date,

42:45.160 --> 42:46.800
more modern metaphor.

42:46.800 --> 42:49.880
He used the metaphor of a film reel and projection.

42:49.880 --> 42:53.360
He said, like, seeing all the suffering in World War I, he said, it's like a movie,

42:53.360 --> 42:54.600
you're watching it.

42:54.600 --> 42:56.240
And those are the roles that people are playing.

42:56.240 --> 42:59.840
But I believe if those guys were alive today, they would use a different metaphor.

42:59.840 --> 43:04.120
They would say, it's like an interactive stage play where we all get to make choices, and

43:04.120 --> 43:06.360
we've kind of all agreed to play these roles.

43:06.360 --> 43:07.840
Well, what does that sound like?

43:07.840 --> 43:11.160
It sounds like an interactive video game.

43:11.160 --> 43:15.360
And so that's why I believe this metaphor helps us, because in a video game, we have

43:15.360 --> 43:19.600
this idea of the player and the avatar, right?

43:19.600 --> 43:24.760
And the avatar is represented digitally inside the computer, and you might ask the same question

43:24.760 --> 43:28.760
of the avatar that you're asking, which is, how can we possibly understand the true nature

43:28.760 --> 43:34.280
of reality when everything here is based on bits and digital and binaries, right?

43:34.280 --> 43:41.100
But if we then take this broader metaphor of where there's a player that's outside

43:41.100 --> 43:46.900
of that game that has a consciousness that can remember not just this particular run

43:46.900 --> 43:52.140
of the game, but also the purpose of the game and why they're playing it, and what that

43:52.140 --> 43:53.140
consciousness is.

43:53.140 --> 43:57.620
Now, I can't tell you if that's a physical reality or just pure consciousness.

43:57.620 --> 44:02.720
Now we're into the really metaphysical, you know, worlds of souls and what does it mean

44:02.720 --> 44:04.440
for it to be a soul.

44:04.440 --> 44:08.480
And you know, in Buddhism versus Hinduism, there's even disagreement about this.

44:08.480 --> 44:13.160
Like they both kind of agree that you have these multiple lives, you come in, you play

44:13.160 --> 44:18.720
a role for a period of time, that life ends, you go back and you come back in.

44:18.720 --> 44:22.120
But in one of them, you have an indestructible soul that's going back and forth.

44:22.120 --> 44:25.240
In the other, in Buddhism, it's not quite so clear.

44:25.240 --> 44:29.480
You have what's called a bag of karma, and what is karma anyway?

44:29.480 --> 44:33.560
It's a set of information in the Eastern traditions, right?

44:33.560 --> 44:38.640
And that information gets stored somewhere and it gets used in constructing the world

44:38.640 --> 44:41.800
and the experiences that you have the next time around.

44:41.800 --> 44:45.840
And you can view it as, I like to think of it as a cloud server, right, that contains

44:45.840 --> 44:47.440
all of the information.

44:47.440 --> 44:52.040
And as just in the same way that, you know, if you and I are interacting, data is being

44:52.040 --> 44:53.540
stored up on the cloud.

44:53.540 --> 44:57.840
And so, you know, while I can't answer that question with any certainty, I can say this

44:57.840 --> 45:02.640
is a metaphor that can maybe help us understand how we can understand, you know, the nature

45:02.640 --> 45:07.440
of the world, even though we're dealing in these bits of information.

45:07.440 --> 45:09.440
Definitely hinted at it beautifully.

45:09.440 --> 45:15.320
And it seems like this re-emergence of psychedelics within the mainstream culture is perfectly

45:15.320 --> 45:19.480
timed considering the context that we're dealing with right now.

45:19.480 --> 45:21.920
Yeah, you're right.

45:21.920 --> 45:26.360
So there's a lot of interest in psychedelics again, particularly in therapeutic applications.

45:26.360 --> 45:29.000
But you know, I don't personally don't have a lot of experience with it.

45:29.000 --> 45:35.520
But people who have will tell me, well, they'll see like, you know, graphical lines and grids

45:35.520 --> 45:39.920
and said, well, you can really see the simulation, you know, when you're taking DMT or something

45:39.920 --> 45:45.880
else and that you can start to see that what we think of as physical reality is not quite

45:45.880 --> 45:46.880
the same.

45:46.880 --> 45:53.400
And so it does lead to this question of have we been socialized to see the world a certain

45:53.400 --> 45:54.440
way, right?

45:54.440 --> 45:59.560
Getting back to our original discussion about science and the epistemology, which means

45:59.560 --> 46:00.960
how do you know something?

46:00.960 --> 46:01.960
That's what that term means.

46:01.960 --> 46:04.640
And say, this is the only way we know things.

46:04.640 --> 46:12.200
But do we then, you know, crystallize this point of view over time when we're children?

46:12.200 --> 46:16.600
You know, maybe children who see imaginary friends are not crazy, right?

46:16.600 --> 46:17.880
It's not just imagination.

46:17.880 --> 46:19.380
Maybe they're seeing spirits.

46:19.380 --> 46:21.960
Maybe there are other worlds like Islamic traditions.

46:21.960 --> 46:27.280
You know, we have the jinns who are other types of beings who exist outside of the physical

46:27.280 --> 46:31.760
reality, but also outside of the timeline, you know, and this ties to this other thing,

46:31.760 --> 46:34.180
the Mandela effect, which we can talk about in a minute.

46:34.180 --> 46:40.140
But I think what you're hinting at, it gets back to I think part of the interest in psychedelics

46:40.140 --> 46:46.840
now is to show that our ordinary state of consciousness is not the only state of consciousness

46:46.840 --> 46:49.120
and that there may be systematic ways.

46:49.120 --> 46:52.860
Of course, shamans have known this for, you know, hundreds of years, if not thousands

46:52.860 --> 46:56.400
of years, and the mystical traditions have been telling this all along.

46:56.400 --> 46:59.920
There are ways to perceive these other worlds.

46:59.920 --> 47:05.120
But the interesting thing about psychedelics is that it also is a boundary object, right?

47:05.120 --> 47:09.680
In the same way that I talk about the simulation metaphor, it's something that scientific and

47:09.680 --> 47:11.760
technically minded people can understand.

47:11.760 --> 47:15.480
It's something that religious and mystically oriented people can understand.

47:15.480 --> 47:20.620
This is something that scientists can understand because it's a physical substance, right?

47:20.620 --> 47:25.440
It's not completely outside of the model of reality that chemicals impact consciousness,

47:25.440 --> 47:26.440
right?

47:26.440 --> 47:29.760
And so it's something they can understand, but it's also something that, you know, within

47:29.760 --> 47:35.960
say the South American shamans, it's, you know, known as the gateway to non-ordinary

47:35.960 --> 47:36.960
reality, right?

47:36.960 --> 47:40.760
And so it's also an interesting kind of boundary object.

47:40.760 --> 47:46.600
I mean, there was a Harvard botanist, ethnobotanist named Wade Davis who, you know, explored looking

47:46.600 --> 47:48.440
at different substances.

47:48.440 --> 47:52.560
He wrote a book which was turned into a movie back in the 80s called The Serpent and the

47:52.560 --> 47:53.560
Rainbow.

47:53.560 --> 47:58.680
And, you know, he went to Haiti to explore these idea reports of zombies, right?

47:58.680 --> 48:05.320
And he was trying to figure out what are the compounds that these shamans or voodoo practitioners

48:05.320 --> 48:09.400
used to make somebody appear as if they're dead.

48:09.400 --> 48:13.960
And then when they brought them back to life, that they were a zombie that they could control,

48:13.960 --> 48:14.960
right?

48:14.960 --> 48:18.600
And so, you know, he found the substance that they were using, which was a very complicated

48:18.600 --> 48:21.920
substance consisted of, you know, puffer fish and other things.

48:21.920 --> 48:28.200
But he found that the cultural sets of beliefs around zombies within Haiti in particular

48:28.200 --> 48:34.720
were just as an important part of the physical thing, which was a part of it as well.

48:34.720 --> 48:39.720
And so, you know, I thought that was an interesting case study of different ways of knowing and

48:39.720 --> 48:44.440
thinking about things, you know, and even, you know, somebody who's studying just the

48:44.440 --> 48:50.160
physical part realized that there is an element of how we construct our reality, which is

48:50.160 --> 48:52.240
based on beliefs, etc.

48:52.240 --> 48:58.160
And so, you know, I find psychedelics an interesting boundary object that can be translated either

48:58.160 --> 48:59.160
way.

48:59.160 --> 49:03.920
And like along with simulation theory, maybe one of those things, along with meditation

49:03.920 --> 49:08.920
and stress and yoga, that starts to open up science to this broader reality and very powerful

49:08.920 --> 49:09.920
tools.

49:09.920 --> 49:18.160
And I have a lot of experience with different kinds of variety, but I tell you this, a lot

49:18.160 --> 49:23.040
of people, I think they're going into it with an expectation and a bias.

49:23.040 --> 49:29.320
So they're experiencing in order to proving their bias.

49:29.320 --> 49:36.320
And I think they're missing out a lot of the experience because it's an incredibly powerful

49:36.320 --> 49:43.720
tool but if you go with the idea that you know what enlightenment is and you just want

49:43.720 --> 49:47.520
to experience it, then you're just going to limit yourself and you will have what they

49:47.520 --> 49:49.160
call bad trips.

49:49.160 --> 49:52.860
Because psychedelics, you know, especially in higher dosage, doesn't care what you think

49:52.860 --> 49:57.920
and how you feel, it just shows you what is.

49:57.920 --> 50:02.600
You know, I often describe it as, you know, essence is a water, form is a container.

50:02.600 --> 50:06.480
And what psychedelic does is they puts a crack in a container.

50:06.480 --> 50:12.560
Now certain kind of psychedelics like Bufo, which is five MEO DMT coming from this one

50:12.560 --> 50:19.800
toad out of 7,000 plus amphibian who generates this poison that you can, you know, milk it

50:19.800 --> 50:22.080
and dry it and smoke it.

50:22.080 --> 50:26.220
That outright shatters the container.

50:26.220 --> 50:28.360
So there is no form.

50:28.360 --> 50:33.200
And you know, when people smoke that, they scream and they do things that they can't

50:33.200 --> 50:36.240
even remember it when they're in that state and when they come back, you know, the whole

50:36.240 --> 50:37.520
thing takes like an hour.

50:37.520 --> 50:41.880
You smoke it, you're gone completely somewhere else and in an hour you drive to pick up your

50:41.880 --> 50:44.800
kid from a school and you're perfectly fine after that.

50:44.800 --> 50:50.960
So you know, this just reminds me of a quote by Gore Vidal that keeps coming up in these

50:50.960 --> 50:55.340
recent episodes that we don't even know what our cage looks like because we've never seen

50:55.340 --> 50:56.340
it from the outside.

50:56.340 --> 50:57.340
Right.

50:57.340 --> 50:58.340
Yeah.

50:58.340 --> 51:03.480
No, it makes a lot of sense and like I said, I don't have a lot of personal experience

51:03.480 --> 51:07.280
with it, but in my conversations with people, you know, they've told me about some of the

51:07.280 --> 51:13.400
types of experiences and what they see and it seems very consistent that the ultimate

51:13.400 --> 51:18.200
reality is very different than what we are perceiving, you know, on a day-to-day basis

51:18.200 --> 51:22.620
and there's independent existence of some of these other entities, you know, that are

51:22.620 --> 51:23.880
out there.

51:23.880 --> 51:30.580
So I think it could be a new way, like I said, to really bridge this gap between the materialist

51:30.580 --> 51:33.320
point of view and the mystical point of view.

51:33.320 --> 51:35.960
So let's talk about mandala effect.

51:35.960 --> 51:41.520
It's in the title of your book and it's one of those things that it forms the reality

51:41.520 --> 51:46.800
that we're experiencing, but mostly people completely ignore it that such things exist.

51:46.800 --> 51:49.680
So let's talk a little more about that.

51:49.680 --> 51:51.880
Yeah, sure.

51:51.880 --> 51:56.280
And I will say that I also, you know, kind of ignored it initially when I had first heard

51:56.280 --> 51:59.960
of it and most people have probably heard of it at this point, it's a pretty popular

51:59.960 --> 52:06.320
internet meme out there, but the idea is that there's a subset of people who remember Nelson

52:06.320 --> 52:11.520
Mandela dying in prison in the 80s and some of those people had very specific memories

52:11.520 --> 52:16.960
of watching his funeral, his wife Winnie giving the speech and her taking over leadership

52:16.960 --> 52:18.840
of the political party.

52:18.840 --> 52:26.120
Now the blogger who coined the term the mandala effect in 2010, a blogger named Fiona Broom,

52:26.120 --> 52:29.620
you know, at that point, Mandela was still alive, right?

52:29.620 --> 52:33.800
So what were they remembering that it couldn't have been his funeral, could it?

52:33.800 --> 52:38.240
And so she noticed that there were a whole bunch of other things that people were remembering

52:38.240 --> 52:42.120
differently, ranging from small things like GIF-y peanut butter.

52:42.120 --> 52:43.120
There's no such thing.

52:43.120 --> 52:48.480
There's only GIF to lines in movies such as, you know, in The Empire Strikes Back.

52:48.480 --> 52:51.760
Many of us think Darth Vader said, Luke, I am your father.

52:51.760 --> 52:56.600
But in fact, he said, no, I am your father, you know, going to entire episodes of Star

52:56.600 --> 53:03.880
Trek that people swear they've seen multiple times but don't actually exist to whole movies.

53:03.880 --> 53:08.400
And so, you know, this phenomenon has become interesting and it's sort of an internet phenomenon

53:08.400 --> 53:13.480
in that before that, before the internet was so widely used and we could share things so

53:13.480 --> 53:19.040
easily within social media or Reddit and other places, you know, it would be hard to know

53:19.040 --> 53:22.320
if anybody else had the same experiences that you have.

53:22.320 --> 53:26.120
And so the conventional explanation is, well, that's just faulty memory.

53:26.120 --> 53:30.660
But you know, in this book, I explore the idea of what if, in fact, these people are

53:30.660 --> 53:37.980
remembering an actual timeline as opposed to simply misremembering things because in

53:37.980 --> 53:44.320
some cases, you have what I call higher significance or higher proximity to the specific thing

53:44.320 --> 53:45.600
that we're talking about.

53:45.600 --> 53:50.080
Now, you know, for example, there are groups of people who remember the Reverend Billy

53:50.080 --> 53:55.880
Graham having died and getting magazine articles with this picture on it who are evangelical

53:55.880 --> 53:56.880
Christians.

53:56.880 --> 54:02.320
Now, I wouldn't know, you know, when the Reverend Billy Graham died or if he's even still alive

54:02.320 --> 54:04.240
because I'm not an evangelical Christian.

54:04.240 --> 54:09.200
But for those people for whom that holds the higher significance, they would know.

54:09.200 --> 54:14.600
And there are many, many reports of them saying, well, I remember his funeral years earlier

54:14.600 --> 54:16.560
than he actually died.

54:16.560 --> 54:21.160
And I remember Bill Clinton speaking there and I remember getting these magazine articles.

54:21.160 --> 54:25.720
And so and similarly, there was a YouTube blogger who was a journalism student who went

54:25.720 --> 54:29.760
to South Africa to interview Nelson Mandela in the 80s.

54:29.760 --> 54:33.760
And she was told he's too ill to do the interviews.

54:33.760 --> 54:36.720
So she had to come all the way back from South Africa.

54:36.720 --> 54:41.280
And then, you know, she was working a couple of months later for NPR, I think, in Chicago.

54:41.280 --> 54:42.280
And he died.

54:42.280 --> 54:46.120
Now, how likely is it that somebody who's a journalist, journalism student and becomes

54:46.120 --> 54:51.240
a journalist and goes to see Nelson Mandela is just going to mistake that death for some

54:51.240 --> 54:55.920
other black leader who died in prison back in the 80s?

54:55.920 --> 54:56.920
Right.

54:56.920 --> 55:00.560
Now, I might mistake it or somebody else might mistake it, but they may not.

55:00.560 --> 55:04.000
And so, you know, that's where this whole thing started to get more interesting.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.440
And then you get to physical objects.

55:06.440 --> 55:07.440
Right.

55:07.440 --> 55:11.880
So the physical object of the thinker, you know, the statue, which shows a pose kind

55:11.880 --> 55:16.400
of like this with, you know, kind of a light, light fist underneath the chin.

55:16.400 --> 55:21.000
Well, there are pictures of people standing next to it in the same pose with their clenched

55:21.000 --> 55:26.080
fist on their forehead, which seems really odd when you look at these physical objects.

55:26.080 --> 55:31.600
And there's actually a picture of G.B. Shaw, George Bernard Shaw, in London, just taken

55:31.600 --> 55:38.440
just before the unveiling of the bronze statue, the thinker, one of the bronze statues.

55:38.440 --> 55:41.920
And it says G.B. Shaw in the pose of the thinker.

55:41.920 --> 55:43.760
And he has his hand on his forehead.

55:43.760 --> 55:45.440
And clearly, the thinker doesn't have that.

55:45.440 --> 55:49.500
And so, you know, these things might have more significance or proximity.

55:49.500 --> 55:54.280
If you're standing next to a statue, you have a higher proximity to that than somebody who's

55:54.280 --> 55:57.200
just heard about it or seen pictures online.

55:57.200 --> 56:01.320
But where it really got interesting was in scriptural changes, right?

56:01.320 --> 56:07.560
We've all heard, you know, the quote from Isaiah about the lion will lie with the lamb.

56:07.560 --> 56:08.960
And you know, it turns out that's not there.

56:08.960 --> 56:12.280
If you look at the King James Bible, it says the wolf would lie with the lamb.

56:12.280 --> 56:17.080
And yet, there are many places where they have pictures of the lion and the lamb with

56:17.080 --> 56:20.480
a quote from Isaiah, like physical objects that are left.

56:20.480 --> 56:25.360
And so, you know, some people who track this stuff, again, getting back to significance,

56:25.360 --> 56:29.960
there are people for whom the Bible verses have real significance that they would be

56:29.960 --> 56:35.080
more likely to remember them than somebody who's not into the Bible.

56:35.080 --> 56:36.560
And they track these online.

56:36.560 --> 56:41.520
And my thought was, well, it's probably just a mistranslation, you know, as an old version

56:41.520 --> 56:44.200
of the King James Bible, the new version.

56:44.200 --> 56:48.320
And some of them claim to have the actual physical book from when they were kids.

56:48.320 --> 56:49.920
And they memorized it, but it's changed.

56:49.920 --> 56:54.000
And so now, in the religious world, you know, they think the explanation might be some sort

56:54.000 --> 56:59.000
of, you know, a satanic force or someone is trying to change it.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.980
So that's a different explanation.

57:01.980 --> 57:06.880
But I found this fascinating and said, well, what if, you know, this was really happening?

57:06.880 --> 57:11.960
Could it be explained through quantum mechanics, through computer science, and through the

57:11.960 --> 57:16.480
metaphor of simulation theory where we run things, you know, multiple times?

57:16.480 --> 57:20.160
And it turns out in the Islamic traditions where, you know, there's something called

57:20.160 --> 57:24.240
a hafiz, who's somebody who memorizes the Quran word for word.

57:24.240 --> 57:27.720
I remember thinking when I was a kid, why do they need to memorize the Quran word for

57:27.720 --> 57:28.720
word?

57:28.720 --> 57:31.840
We've got written books, you know, and then now we have computers, so you don't really

57:31.840 --> 57:34.720
need to sit there and spend years memorizing this.

57:34.720 --> 57:40.520
And so there's the Sufi imam who's on record saying, well, one of the reasons why we do

57:40.520 --> 57:46.440
this is because supposedly there are beings outside of time, in this case, jinn, who have

57:46.440 --> 57:51.460
the ability to go back and change variables in the past, you know, and change things,

57:51.460 --> 57:53.840
but they can't change our memories, right?

57:53.840 --> 58:00.120
And so, you know, all of this, and you don't have to believe in the Mandel effect necessarily.

58:00.120 --> 58:04.240
You know, in my book, I say, well, let's do a what if, let's suppose that these people

58:04.240 --> 58:08.040
aren't crazy, they're not just misremembering, and see if we can explain it.

58:08.040 --> 58:14.440
And a lot of this reminded me of the science fiction writer, Philip K. Dick, and he gave

58:14.440 --> 58:20.720
a speech in Metz, France, in 1977, where he said, we are living in a computer programmed

58:20.720 --> 58:26.940
reality and the only clue we have is when some variable is changed, some alteration

58:26.940 --> 58:28.280
is made in our reality.

58:28.280 --> 58:31.640
Now that quote has become kind of famous over the years.

58:31.640 --> 58:37.320
And so I interviewed his wife, Tessa, for my first book, just because I thought it was

58:37.320 --> 58:39.480
kind of a fun way to talk about simulation theory.

58:39.480 --> 58:44.000
And the Wachowskis who created The Matrix were inspired by the writings of Philip K.

58:44.000 --> 58:45.000
Dick.

58:45.000 --> 58:49.360
And, you know, he explored several themes in his science fiction, one of which is what

58:49.360 --> 58:54.160
does it mean to be human, but the second one of which is what is reality, what is real

58:54.160 --> 58:55.160
and what isn't.

58:55.160 --> 58:58.600
And he explored that theme again and again in his books.

58:58.600 --> 59:04.200
And Tessa told me that he came to believe that there were other timelines and that he

59:04.200 --> 59:06.200
had memories of those timelines.

59:06.200 --> 59:12.280
And one of those memories is what resulted in his best received book while he was alive,

59:12.280 --> 59:17.160
The Man in the High Castle, which was about the German and the Japanese winning World

59:17.160 --> 59:18.360
War II.

59:18.360 --> 59:23.360
And he said he remembered that entire timeline moving forward.

59:23.360 --> 59:26.320
But then that timeline got rewound for some reason.

59:26.320 --> 59:30.160
And so, you know, this is quite fascinating because he said at one point all of those

59:30.160 --> 59:33.160
memories came back to him.

59:33.160 --> 59:39.800
And in a process that he used a Greek word called anamnesis, which, you know, means sort

59:39.800 --> 59:44.600
of remembering, but literally it means a loss of forgetfulness.

59:44.600 --> 59:48.920
And you're remembering all these things that you used to know but that you have forgotten.

59:48.920 --> 59:53.240
And so what he was really talking about, I realized, was this idea that you could change

59:53.240 --> 59:55.560
variables and rerun things.

59:55.560 --> 01:00:00.200
And he said we would have the sense that we were reliving the same events, we were hearing

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:03.000
the same words, we'd have a sense of deja vu.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.080
And such an impression is valid.

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:09.680
And that is a clue that at some point in the past some variable was changed, some alteration

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:12.280
occurred and an alternate reality branched off.

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:17.520
Well, this reminded me a lot of the quantum multiverse explanation that there are multiple

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:20.840
universes with each quantum decision that's made.

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:24.200
And so, you know, that kind of tied together for me.

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:28.640
And then what Philip K. Dick said that's interesting because the Mandela effect hadn't been defined

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:29.640
at the time.

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:34.440
But he also said, well, I remember an alternate present because all we would need to do is

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:41.120
find a subgroup of people that have a memory of a different timeline.

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.880
And so, you know, that's what the Mandela effect is.

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:46.600
It's a group of people who remember different variables.

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.840
And it's not just one alternate timeline.

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:50.640
There are lots of Mandela effects.

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:54.320
And so, you know, I tried to come up with a framework and actually the framework of

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:59.600
quantum mechanics made sense because it, you know, provides for this thing that I call

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:02.480
the multiverse graph, which is the list of all possibilities.

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:09.040
Getting back to your poem as well, right, that what we think of as time is not what

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.320
we think it is, right?

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:16.760
This is about navigating through a particular set of nodes within this graph.

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:21.880
And when we say this didn't happen or that didn't happen, you know, this gets back to

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:25.720
the idea of the life review and near-death experiences as well.

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:30.000
So anyway, that's how, you know, I got into the Mandela effect and that's how it made

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.960
its way, you know, into this book, The Simulated Multiverse.

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:33.960
That was awesome.

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:37.840
If this is not convincing people to go and get this book and read it, I don't know what

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:38.840
else would.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:42.080
This is just so beautifully said and tie everything together.

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:46.640
The book, once again, is called The Simulated Multiverse and MIT Computer Scientists Explore

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:52.040
Parallel Universes, The Simulation Hypothesis, Quantum Computing, and The Mandela Effect.

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:55.240
I tell you this because I grew up in Iran and I went to school there.

01:01:55.240 --> 01:02:00.840
One of the reasons people attempted to memorize Quran was because if you could memorize Quran,

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:04.480
you didn't have to go to military service, which was mandatory.

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:10.320
Right, so there's a practical reason, right?

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:12.480
Yep, absolutely.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:16.680
The social benefits of a certain way of thinking about things, right?

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:21.440
Yeah, but you know, you kind of blew my mind because this is a unique thing about Islam

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:29.240
and Quran that they're saying that even if a vow is changed, it's basically a sin.

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:33.520
It's one of the biggest sins and the person who changed that vow needs to be killed.

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:41.840
So at first, it's very extreme because this is actually a perfect bridge to where I want

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:47.600
to go with how we kind of need to reinterpret a lot of these religious and philosophical

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:49.520
principles for this time.

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:56.040
It is extreme because this is the same approach of the desert people from 1400 years ago,

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.040
right?

01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:00.840
It's the same thing that they're doing in Afghanistan now and Pakistan and obviously

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:07.640
it's not working in this world, but there are a lot of hints and clues within all of

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:14.280
these things that we can put together in order to reinterpret and maybe upgrade these kind

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.120
of perspective.

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:21.520
Let me read you a question that Julio Prisco, I believe you know him.

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:26.520
I told him that I'm going to talk to you and he asked me to ask you this question,

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:33.360
that what should be done to make new religions inspired by science, for example, based on

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:42.400
simulation cosmology, as popular and energizing as traditional religions?

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.400
That's an interesting question.

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:50.080
I kind of like to call simulation theory the first new religion of the 21st century, right?

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:57.960
Because we are at a critical point where enough people understand this metaphor of the video

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:05.080
game and that the younger generation spends much more time being avatars within video

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:07.480
games than we ever did before.

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:15.440
So they're very open to this idea that what we think of as reality might be in fact like

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:17.200
Minecraft, right?

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:19.040
Might be in fact like Fortnite.

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:23.200
And so a lot of times people who read my first book, The Simulation Hypothesis, will tell

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:29.240
me, oh, I got into this because my kids asked me, are we living in a simulation?

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:36.360
And so I think that, like I said earlier, simulation theory provides a way to think

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:41.920
about and reinterpret, just like you were saying, some of these older metaphors that

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:42.920
people used.

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:46.680
I mean, if you look, we've been talking about the Islamic traditions a little bit.

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:51.080
If you go back to the Bible and the Koran and that traditions, they talk about the Book

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:55.700
of Life and Judaism and Christianity and the Scroll of Deeds in Islam.

01:04:55.700 --> 01:05:00.660
And the Scroll of Deeds is said to be a list, a book, a scroll, something they understood

01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:07.000
back then, of every single action that you performed in your life with two angels, the

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.720
Kiram and Kitabah, I think they were called, and they actually have names, these angels.

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:17.320
And of course, if we think of that as there are two angels for every person and there's

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:22.220
actually 14 billion angels, I mean, that's an outdated metaphor, right?

01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:28.240
And so today in computer science, we use the term daemon for a process that is running

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.120
on a computer by itself.

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:34.640
And so if we were to record everything, the metaphor of the book seems old.

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:37.040
We would simply record everything, right?

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:43.560
We would use a video recording, just like we do in Twitch, and to show off our video

01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:44.560
gameplay.

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:49.200
I mean, my nephew, when he was like three years old, would say, hey, I want to watch

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:51.840
Star Wars gameplay.

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:55.380
I want to watch that man and that woman playing Star Wars on YouTube, right?

01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:58.520
And so it's a recording of the actual gameplay.

01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:03.640
And so if we reinterpret, you know, what these religions were saying, I mean, they were using

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:13.200
the metaphors and practices of 1400 or 2000 or 2500 or 5000 years ago into today's terms,

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.920
you know, we would use different metaphors.

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:19.060
And so I believe simulation theory is a great metaphor for that.

01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:25.120
But also it kind of, I think, will help because if you look at in the US, for example, the

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:30.960
fastest growing religion is not necessarily atheism or Christianity or Islam.

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:36.680
It's the fastest growing designation, sorry, not necessarily religion is spiritual, but

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:39.880
not religious, right?

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:45.520
And so that means people who believe there is more, but who don't find the religious

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:52.200
traditions of the traditional of these religions to be palatable within the modern context.

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:56.800
And what we have to remember is each of these religions were very modernizing at the time.

01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:01.920
I mean, they were considered liberal folks who were, you know, literally iconoclast means

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:03.560
the breaking of idols, right?

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:07.400
That's literally what the word means based on, you know, the Prophet Muhammad breaking

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:12.500
the idols in Mecca at the Kaaba, you know, some 1400 years ago.

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:18.240
But the people who created these religions, you know, and even, you know, within Buddhism,

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:22.320
there was a response to the caste system, within Hinduism, and so, you know, they were

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:27.200
kind of upending the social order somewhat when they created these religions.

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:32.080
And so I think, you know, social simulation theory gives us a new way to do that.

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:35.900
And you know, I don't know whether it's going to become an organized religion or not.

01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:37.120
That's an interesting question.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:41.080
I'm following that myself, but I think it certainly could be.

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:47.440
But I think it's even better to think of as a way into religion, into the spiritual but

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:53.080
not religious ideas, right, for the millions and millions of youngsters today who will

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:55.740
be, you know, the leaders of tomorrow.

01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:59.680
So I think there is an opportunity to kind of broaden the definition.

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:04.200
And I think young people today, you know, there isn't such a huge, okay, this is science,

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:05.280
this is religion.

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:08.720
They haven't necessarily been indoctrinated into that in the same way.

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:13.200
And so simulation theory gives us, I think, a way to bridge that gap, as I've said before.

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:14.200
Yeah, beautiful.

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:20.000
I think the decentralized nature of it is very appealing to me because my understanding

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:27.960
of this concept of divine is that it's been hijacked by organized religions, and it really

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:32.680
is decentralized, and we are having subjective experiences, and each of our understanding

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:34.320
is a part of it.

01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:39.880
And it's not only our understanding as humans, you know, a tree has an experience of the

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:42.040
divine in its own way.

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:46.640
Sea has, you know, its own experience, rock has its own experience.

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:51.520
And mathematically speaking, I was talking to James Lindsay more than a year ago about

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:52.520
this.

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:57.560
And he was like, there are certain numbers that we can write and say your name, but after

01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:01.280
a certain amount of numbers, there is there is nothing we can do about it.

01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:03.560
We put dot dot dot.

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:10.360
And he said that he called it infinite points that he would, he's an atheist, he would recognize

01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:16.280
the validity of an argument for God, quote unquote, God as a placeholder in that dot

01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:17.880
dot dot.

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:26.200
So it's something like this simulation theory is a fertile ground basically for the decentralized

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:31.000
subjective experience of the divinity and the divine that is everything and anything

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.800
that has any kind of an experience.

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:37.100
Yeah, I think you're right.

01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:41.800
It is much more it can be much more decentralized depending on how you view it now.

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:46.240
You know, in my view, I think tends to be what I call the RPG version of simulation

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:47.240
theory.

01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:51.760
Simulation theory also sometimes scares people in the religious sense because of what I like

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:57.360
to call the NPC version or the non-player character version in which everyone is just

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:58.960
code on the server.

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:02.600
And people freak out if they if they think of it that way, because then it's like, well,

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:03.600
your life is meaningless.

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.180
You're just an AI bot.

01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:09.360
But I think that the RPG version, the role playing game version where we are playing

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:14.400
an avatar is the more powerful metaphor and the one that opens up, you know, this ability

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:17.440
because people always say, well, who's outside the simulation?

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:18.440
Is it aliens?

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:19.440
Right.

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:20.440
You mentioned that earlier as well.

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:21.440
Is it time travelers?

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:25.240
Is it, you know, an evil entity that's controlling it?

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:26.240
Is it jinn?

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:27.240
Is it Satan's?

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:28.240
Is it God?

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:29.240
Is it these things?

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:30.240
And say, well, what if it's us?

01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:31.240
Right.

01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:37.360
So we are outside the simulation and we have on our headsets and we are now we have chosen

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:38.600
to play the game.

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:42.880
We are taking on the challenges in the same way that in a video game you have to have

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:46.000
quests and challenges in order to make the game interesting.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.480
Otherwise, the game is no fun.

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:51.220
And we've agreed to these challenges in our lives.

01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:56.560
And so it becomes a different way to think about the challenges of life and to view the

01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:02.360
world, but also to open our minds to this greater perspective that might be out there.

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:03.360
So yeah.

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:04.360
I mean, I agree with that.

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.840
I think simulation theory can be a doorway to the divide.

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:07.840
Amazing.

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:12.160
The book is called The Simulated Multiverse and MIT Computer Scientists Explores Parallel

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:16.520
Universes, The Simulation Hypothesis, Quantum Computing, and the Mandela Effect.

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:19.640
It's available in Kindle, paperback and audiobook.

01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:20.640
Is it available?

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:25.040
It will be available in audiobook soon, but the audiobook has not been released yet, but

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:26.040
yeah, it will be.

01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:30.760
Well, Rizwan, thank you so much again for your time and your generosity with your knowledge.

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:33.120
Every time we talk, it's amazing.

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:34.440
So I really do appreciate it.

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:40.280
Let's end this program, this episode, with your message to the world as we are surfing

01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:46.120
this exponential curve of technological progress towards a singularity and everything that

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:49.520
is happening with and because of it.

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:58.680
Sure, you know, my advice to the world is, you know, let's not take everything so seriously.

01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:02.920
And it's very possible that all of this is a video game and the challenges that we're

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:07.320
going through are challenges that we have chosen to be here.

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:11.960
And that can give us a different perspective in life and the challenges are important in

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:38.960
our lives, you know.
