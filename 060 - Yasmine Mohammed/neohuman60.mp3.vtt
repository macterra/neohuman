00:00.000 --> 00:05.440
Once you free your head, you can free your mind. It's really just

00:05.440 --> 00:09.680
the first step, just just breaking off the shackles of the

00:09.680 --> 00:15.520
hijab. And then a woman is allowed to start thinking and to

00:15.520 --> 00:21.320
start feeling and to start being and to start just feeling like a

00:21.320 --> 00:25.320
human being, you know, you can't even do that when you're still

00:25.320 --> 00:31.000
shackled to this garb that forces you to just become the

00:31.040 --> 00:35.800
image of a Muslim woman. You know, you don't have any

00:35.800 --> 00:39.400
personal autonomy. You don't have any individuality. You are

00:39.400 --> 00:45.000
just Muslim woman. That's it. That's how the world sees you.

00:45.280 --> 00:46.840
That's how you see yourself.

00:46.840 --> 00:59.040
Hello, and welcome to the 60th episode of a new human podcast.

00:59.040 --> 01:02.680
I'm a Ghabha Hari, a geologist on Twitter and Instagram. And you

01:02.680 --> 01:07.000
can follow this podcast on liveinlimbo.com, iTunes, YouTube

01:07.000 --> 01:12.320
and BitChute. And with me today, I have Yasmeen Mohammed, and

01:12.360 --> 01:14.840
welcome to Neo Human Podcast, Yasmeen.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.640
Thank you very much for having me.

01:16.680 --> 01:19.520
Absolute pleasure. You're one of those people that I've been

01:19.520 --> 01:23.880
thinking about having for a long time, had ex Muslims before,

01:24.520 --> 01:28.600
tried to get Ayaan Hirsi Ali number of times, complete failure

01:28.600 --> 01:32.200
on that front. But you know, it's happening. It's happening.

01:32.200 --> 01:35.160
So it's a pleasure to have you. Let's start with your

01:35.160 --> 01:40.120
background for those of our audience who don't know who you

01:40.120 --> 01:43.320
are, the work you've done, lives you've lived, and what are you

01:43.320 --> 01:44.880
mainly focused on now these days?

01:45.840 --> 01:50.320
Okay. So I grew up in a fundamentalist Muslim

01:50.360 --> 01:56.200
household. I was forced into a marriage with an al-Qaeda agent,

01:56.560 --> 02:01.560
got away from him. We had a daughter together. So I got my

02:01.600 --> 02:03.400
myself and my daughter away from him.

02:03.560 --> 02:04.680
Which country were you in?

02:05.080 --> 02:11.720
Canada. This was all in Canada. Okay. Yeah. And then I started

02:11.720 --> 02:16.880
going to university, took a history of religions course,

02:16.920 --> 02:19.960
where I was finally allowed to talk about Islam and question

02:19.960 --> 02:22.400
it and, you know, think critically about it. And so of

02:22.400 --> 02:29.000
course, that led to me leaving the religion. And I was quietly

02:29.000 --> 02:32.840
an ex-Muslim for a long time, because of course, you know, the

02:32.840 --> 02:40.280
punishment for leaving Islam is execution. And so I lived like

02:40.280 --> 02:45.800
that quietly for a long time until the infamous episode of

02:45.840 --> 02:50.920
Bill Maher with Sam Harris and Ben Affleck, where they, Ben

02:50.920 --> 02:55.040
Affleck called them gross and racist. And that sort of

02:55.040 --> 02:58.680
encouraged me to start speaking up. I felt like I agreed with

02:58.680 --> 03:02.120
everything that Sam and Bill had to say, but the two men were

03:02.120 --> 03:04.520
being attacked. Basically, they're being attacked for being

03:04.520 --> 03:09.320
white male Americans. So I said, you know, I'm going to say the

03:09.320 --> 03:13.880
same thing as them, but I'm going to be a brown female Arab.

03:14.680 --> 03:19.640
And so now people are going to be forced to address the actual

03:19.640 --> 03:26.240
message that as opposed to just stopping and being, you know,

03:26.240 --> 03:31.880
stuck on the identity of the messenger. And so then I decided

03:31.880 --> 03:36.040
I was going to start writing my book. And so I started writing a

03:36.040 --> 03:42.920
blog, first of all, and I was still anonymous at the time. So

03:42.920 --> 03:47.560
the blog was called Confessions of an Ex-Muslim. And I started

03:47.560 --> 03:51.640
getting messages from all over the Muslim majority world from

03:51.720 --> 03:57.000
men and women that were very happy that I was speaking out,

03:57.480 --> 04:01.000
and were asking me to basically be their voice. And then I

04:01.000 --> 04:04.440
started to feel really ashamed that these are people that are

04:04.440 --> 04:08.360
living in countries where they could be executed for speaking

04:08.360 --> 04:11.800
out. And here I am living in the free West, afraid to show my

04:11.800 --> 04:19.320
face. And so I decided to go public. And this was all about

04:19.320 --> 04:23.480
three years ago, and I finally got my book published. And it is

04:23.480 --> 04:27.720
called Unveiled, How Western Liberals Empower Radicalists

04:27.720 --> 04:34.520
Islam. And what a title. What a title. Spot on. Sam helped me

04:34.520 --> 04:38.680
with that. And then I also started an organization called

04:38.680 --> 04:42.920
Free Hearts, Free Minds, which supports people who have left

04:42.920 --> 04:46.760
Islam, but are still stuck in Muslim majority countries. So if

04:46.760 --> 04:50.360
you go to that website and click on testimonials, you can read

04:50.360 --> 04:53.480
from people who we have helped over the past year.

04:53.480 --> 05:00.280
Now, we have a lot in common. I was born in Iran. We talked

05:00.280 --> 05:05.080
about it briefly before coming live, that you would be interested

05:05.080 --> 05:08.680
to know about my background as well. I was born in Iran, born

05:08.680 --> 05:12.120
into a family that was marked as Shia Muslim, because their

05:12.120 --> 05:14.920
parents were Shia Muslim, and their parents were Shia Muslim.

05:15.320 --> 05:18.440
And therefore, I always say that I was one second old,

05:18.440 --> 05:23.800
automatically it was, you know, the labels that were have placed

05:23.800 --> 05:29.000
on me, I was a straight male Iranian Shia Muslim. And good

05:29.000 --> 05:31.400
luck getting rid of any of those, because they come with

05:31.400 --> 05:35.000
the expectations that are built within that society, not only

05:35.000 --> 05:38.120
the theocracy, but also the society and the family

05:38.120 --> 05:43.320
structure. And so when you mentioned Ben Affleck, one thing

05:43.320 --> 05:46.440
that stands out is that how he mentioned that, well, I was

05:46.440 --> 05:49.240
saying something like this, you're offending 1.7 billion

05:49.240 --> 05:54.120
Muslims. But the idea that once you're born into this religion,

05:54.120 --> 05:57.480
there is no way out of it, unless you're willing to risk

05:57.480 --> 06:01.400
your life. And this is a very sinister aspect that is very

06:01.400 --> 06:04.680
unique to Islam. Would you like to expand on that a little, that

06:04.680 --> 06:09.160
this whole cynicism about what you can't really offend 1.7

06:09.160 --> 06:14.760
billion people, but that 1.7 billion large club, it's

06:14.760 --> 06:18.600
large club, includes millions of people who are more than

06:18.600 --> 06:22.040
willing to leave, but they are not willing to risk their lives

06:22.040 --> 06:25.400
or just give up all their family lives and everything, their

06:25.400 --> 06:26.440
identity, basically.

06:27.320 --> 06:32.600
That's exactly it. And so when he was stopping the criticism

06:32.600 --> 06:36.040
of Islam, basically what he was doing is he was condemning

06:36.040 --> 06:42.360
those people to stay under this ideologies tyranny. So he

06:42.360 --> 06:47.880
should have been supporting freedom of thought. This is a

06:47.880 --> 06:52.200
man who made a movie called Dogma where he's criticizing

06:52.200 --> 06:56.280
the religion of Christianity. So he's very familiar with how

06:57.000 --> 07:01.960
Dogma can be imposed on people against their will. And if

07:01.960 --> 07:07.400
only he knew how many Muslim people across the Muslim

07:07.400 --> 07:13.000
majority world would love to have their freedom of thought

07:13.000 --> 07:16.440
and their freedom of conscience and just their freedom to live

07:16.440 --> 07:20.600
for goodness sake. I mean, in their laws, they have Sharia,

07:20.600 --> 07:26.760
which is based on Islam, which is 1400 year old ideology. So it

07:26.760 --> 07:31.640
is suppressing the progress of these countries. The people

07:31.640 --> 07:36.920
themselves are like, you know, people look at the government

07:36.920 --> 07:40.200
and they assume that that's the people. People look at the

07:40.200 --> 07:43.640
fundamentalist ideology of Islam and they assume that that's

07:43.640 --> 07:50.200
the people but that's not true. Muslim people want to be free

07:50.200 --> 07:53.080
just like Christian people want to be free and Jewish people

07:53.080 --> 07:55.320
want to be free and Hindu people want to be free and

07:55.320 --> 07:58.520
atheist people want to be free. Everybody just wants to be

07:58.520 --> 08:03.480
free. And when, you know, when Ben was doing that, basically

08:03.480 --> 08:10.280
what he was doing was literally, I'm gonna let you guys

08:13.400 --> 08:16.200
we supposed to start a little earlier today. But you know,

08:16.200 --> 08:19.320
that's the thing later in the day, we get a more energetic

08:19.320 --> 08:24.280
dogs get until they fall asleep. But I was going to say that he

08:24.280 --> 08:31.080
was literally proving the subtitle of my book, which is

08:31.080 --> 08:35.880
western how western liberals empower radical Islam. He was

08:35.880 --> 08:39.800
protecting radical Islam. He was protecting fundamentalist

08:39.800 --> 08:44.600
Islam by stopping these men from speaking about liberalism

08:44.600 --> 08:48.680
and all of the liberal Muslims and all of the reform Muslims

08:48.680 --> 08:52.200
and all of the free thinking Muslims that are stuck under

08:52.200 --> 08:56.440
that ideology that would have been very excited like I was at

08:56.440 --> 09:01.240
the time, very excited and very happy to see this conversation

09:01.240 --> 09:05.240
happening on mainstream media that these two men actually

09:05.240 --> 09:09.240
cared about our plight and what was going on in our communities.

09:09.240 --> 09:13.240
Yeah, absolutely. My biggest culture shock because I arrived

09:13.240 --> 09:18.040
in Canada in 2006 as a refugee. I was human traffic through

09:18.040 --> 09:20.840
five countries, you know, left Iran with a fabricated

09:20.840 --> 09:24.040
password and my crime was that I was a heavy metal guitar

09:24.040 --> 09:28.840
player who, you know, I got even permitted by something

09:28.840 --> 09:32.840
in Iran called Ministry of Guidance and Islamic Culture

09:32.840 --> 09:35.640
that you have to go and get permission if you want to do

09:35.640 --> 09:39.640
anything cultural related, so music, books, movies, anything.

09:39.640 --> 09:44.040
And I didn't get permission after the second time. So I

09:44.040 --> 09:46.840
just continue doing it underground and then I was deemed

09:46.840 --> 09:49.640
as corrupting the revolutionary youth. I will never forget

09:49.640 --> 09:52.840
that charge. I'm corrupting the revolutionary youth by being

09:52.840 --> 09:56.440
a heavy metal guitar player, then got a court summon, our

09:56.440 --> 10:01.640
house got raided. It was just insane. So when I made it to

10:01.640 --> 10:04.840
Canada, I always say that my biggest culture shock was how

10:04.840 --> 10:08.840
people were treating Islam because in Iran, in my

10:08.840 --> 10:12.040
environment, everybody were not only done with the theocracy,

10:12.040 --> 10:14.840
they were done with Islam. They're done with the religion.

10:14.840 --> 10:16.840
Like we don't want to have anything to do with it. Like

10:16.840 --> 10:20.440
Persians have their own thing and all of that, but the way

10:20.440 --> 10:26.040
that the Westerners, these white liberal privileged people

10:26.040 --> 10:28.040
are like, no, you don't know what you're talking about.

10:28.040 --> 10:32.040
You had the wrong experience. What is it about? Because

10:32.040 --> 10:35.640
this is not the first time that Islamists and leftists are

10:35.640 --> 10:38.440
coming together. We had the same thing before the Iranian

10:38.440 --> 10:41.640
revolution. Iraq is experiencing the similar thing.

10:41.640 --> 10:46.040
What is it about Islam and far left and leftism that they

10:46.040 --> 10:48.840
come together, they make alliances against the West,

10:48.840 --> 10:52.040
against capitalism, against America, and once they succeed,

10:52.040 --> 10:55.640
they start eating each other and usually Islamists are the

10:55.640 --> 10:59.240
more successful part of that because they're more willing

10:59.240 --> 11:01.640
to kill. You know, their permission is coming from Allah.

11:01.640 --> 11:04.840
It's not from the man.

11:04.840 --> 11:10.840
Yeah, yeah, a much stronger ideology, a much more

11:10.840 --> 11:14.840
established ideology. So yeah, and like you said, they're

11:14.840 --> 11:17.880
the ones that are willing to kill as well. Yeah, you're

11:17.880 --> 11:23.240
right. That is incredibly terrifying to know that that

11:23.240 --> 11:29.800
kind of alliance has a history of repeating itself and you

11:29.800 --> 11:34.440
can sort of see the writing on the wall here in the Western

11:34.440 --> 11:41.400
world now, but I think, you know, I hope that enough of us

11:41.400 --> 11:49.640
will make enough noise that it won't get as far over here, but

11:49.640 --> 11:52.520
it's really important for us to not be complacent and to not

11:52.520 --> 11:56.840
be apathetic and to not just trust that Western values are

11:56.840 --> 12:00.440
going to prevail. You know, if we don't support our own

12:00.440 --> 12:06.120
values, our values are fragile and new really in comparison

12:06.120 --> 12:10.600
to Islamic values and we're not willing to kill people. You

12:10.600 --> 12:16.920
know, it's not authoritarian, so it is very important, I think,

12:16.920 --> 12:22.520
that we fail our in being proud of what we have accomplished

12:22.520 --> 12:25.560
in being proud of Western values and progressive values

12:25.560 --> 12:29.720
and things like feminism and LGBT quality and all of these

12:29.720 --> 12:34.280
things that we've achieved. We have to celebrate ourselves

12:34.280 --> 12:39.960
more and appreciate these things more as opposed to

12:39.960 --> 12:44.040
constantly self-flagellating. So, you know, in the US, they're

12:44.040 --> 12:47.400
very like in the First Amendment, it talks about free

12:47.400 --> 12:51.320
speech. We know how important free speech is, but you can see

12:51.320 --> 12:55.640
it being challenged all over the United States of America.

12:55.640 --> 12:59.880
It's incredibly terrifying like people don't realize how

12:59.880 --> 13:04.520
important these values are and how important it is for us to

13:04.520 --> 13:10.040
defend them like really loudly. Instead, we're we're almost

13:10.040 --> 13:13.560
like ashamed of our values. Yeah, and it just seems like

13:13.560 --> 13:16.760
the double standard that is being practiced by a lot of

13:16.760 --> 13:20.520
people on the left who, you know, they could be well

13:20.520 --> 13:23.000
meaning, but you know what they say that the road to hell is

13:23.000 --> 13:28.920
paved by good will, good meaning because when you look at a

13:28.920 --> 13:32.440
country like Iran where people and this goes back to the title

13:32.440 --> 13:35.960
of your book, Unveiled, which I want you to expand on that.

13:35.960 --> 13:39.640
What was the experience of unveiling for you because

13:39.640 --> 13:43.480
people don't realize it that someone like Ilhan Omar, I

13:43.480 --> 13:46.840
actually commented under one of your posts on Twitter.

13:46.840 --> 13:50.120
Absolutely recommend everybody to follow you on Twitter

13:50.120 --> 13:52.920
because, you know, there's so much to learn right from the

13:52.920 --> 13:57.880
source. Ilhan Omar, her initial claim to fame is being the

13:57.880 --> 14:02.840
first congress person to wear a hijab, but there is no limit in

14:02.840 --> 14:06.760
Congress of United States to wear a hijab. At the same time,

14:06.760 --> 14:09.720
all of these feminists that goodness forbid you say

14:09.720 --> 14:12.280
something negative about Ilhan Omar attack you as an

14:12.280 --> 14:17.720
Islamophobe and a whatever, they are all silent about people

14:17.720 --> 14:22.600
in Iran, women in Iran who are risking their lives just to

14:22.600 --> 14:25.640
take their veil off and send the video to someone like

14:25.640 --> 14:28.760
Masih Ali Najat and then they're attacking someone like

14:28.760 --> 14:32.040
Masih Ali Najat. Oh, this is the instrument of Mike Pompeo

14:32.040 --> 14:36.520
Trump. What is happening with this double standard that it

14:36.520 --> 14:39.160
just so obvious, you know, ignorance is definitely not an

14:39.160 --> 14:42.840
excuse in the age of social media and information and

14:42.840 --> 14:49.400
explain to the audience if you will this weight of being veiled

14:49.400 --> 14:54.360
as the matter of involuntary necessity for a lot of women

14:54.360 --> 14:58.040
and a lot of girls who are coming from that culture. I

14:58.040 --> 15:01.560
think that if they were honest with themselves, they would

15:01.560 --> 15:06.840
immediately recognize and understand how, you know, like

15:06.840 --> 15:09.640
the way you called it, the weight of the veil, how it's

15:09.640 --> 15:13.880
literally like shackles being put on a person. I mean,

15:13.880 --> 15:17.240
they're over here talking about free the nipple. They want to

15:17.240 --> 15:20.040
have their freedom to wear whatever they want. They

15:20.040 --> 15:23.720
understand the importance of personal autonomy. This isn't

15:23.720 --> 15:27.080
like something that they don't understand, but what's

15:27.080 --> 15:31.880
disgusting is how they don't value women on the other side

15:31.880 --> 15:35.160
of the world as much as they value themselves and they think

15:35.160 --> 15:42.200
that those women somehow, you know, find empowerment in

15:42.200 --> 15:45.480
taking their personal autonomy away. You know, for them,

15:45.480 --> 15:48.680
hijab is good, but not for me. No, no, no. For me, I get to

15:48.680 --> 15:52.280
wear whatever I want, but for them, I will celebrate them

15:52.280 --> 15:54.840
when they wear hijab and I will put it on the cover of

15:54.840 --> 15:58.040
magazines and I'll be so proud of Ilhan Omar that she puts a

15:58.040 --> 16:02.040
scarf on her head as if she has done something. Like you said,

16:02.040 --> 16:05.640
you know, there are no restrictions against women in

16:05.640 --> 16:13.240
America wearing hijab. It's not some act of bravery, but if

16:13.240 --> 16:16.760
you really want to see acts of bravery, then you should look

16:16.760 --> 16:21.080
to the women in Iran who when they remove their hijab, they

16:21.080 --> 16:25.400
are thrown in prison for 10 years or more. That's where the

16:25.400 --> 16:28.280
bravery is. Those are the people that we should be

16:28.280 --> 16:32.360
supporting. If you're truly a feminist and you truly care

16:32.360 --> 16:36.760
about women, then it's very easy to see which women need

16:36.760 --> 16:39.960
your support and which women you should be standing behind,

16:39.960 --> 16:45.320
but at best, those women are ignored and at worst, people

16:45.320 --> 16:47.880
speak out against them like the way they're speaking out

16:47.880 --> 16:51.800
against Massey now and they're calling her a mouthpiece for

16:51.800 --> 16:57.000
Trump. Massey has been fighting this fight from before Trump

16:57.000 --> 17:01.640
ever even entered politics when he was still doing reality TV.

17:01.640 --> 17:05.080
It's such an insult to this woman who has devoted her

17:05.080 --> 17:09.560
entire life to this cause to now call her a mouthpiece for

17:09.560 --> 17:13.640
Trump. They don't care. It doesn't matter. They don't care

17:13.640 --> 17:16.360
about the actual individuals. They don't care what they're

17:16.360 --> 17:18.920
doing to Massey. They don't care that her brother has been

17:18.920 --> 17:22.520
imprisoned by the Islamic regime because they can't

17:22.520 --> 17:26.360
reach her. They don't care about the the more danger that

17:26.360 --> 17:29.560
they're putting her and her family in. It doesn't matter to

17:29.560 --> 17:33.320
them. They just wanna push their own agenda. So, it's the

17:33.320 --> 17:37.240
same thing with the Iranian protesters right now that are

17:37.240 --> 17:42.120
I mean, I can't even fathom the kind of bravery it takes for

17:42.120 --> 17:46.600
you to go into the streets when you know that over a thousand

17:46.600 --> 17:50.440
people have been killed on those same streets for protesting

17:50.440 --> 17:54.120
in the exact same way that you are protesting today and

17:54.120 --> 17:59.160
somehow they have this super human bravery to stand out

17:59.160 --> 18:04.840
there and protest against this regime and what when that

18:04.840 --> 18:08.680
happens the media that should be supporting them that should

18:08.680 --> 18:12.360
be standing behind them. This should be for freedom and for

18:12.360 --> 18:17.160
democracy and for liberty. They don't want to talk about it.

18:17.160 --> 18:20.280
They don't wanna support them because they're afraid that

18:20.280 --> 18:23.720
that might end up look like like it's supporting Trump. Who

18:23.720 --> 18:27.960
cares about Trump? It is irrelevant. It doesn't matter.

18:27.960 --> 18:31.640
You know, Trump only got involved in this whole thing

18:31.640 --> 18:34.120
because Americans were involved in this whole thing,

18:34.120 --> 18:37.800
right? That's the only time we saw American involvement,

18:37.800 --> 18:40.600
right? He's the president of the United States. His job is

18:40.600 --> 18:44.600
to take care of American citizens. Iranians don't, it

18:44.600 --> 18:47.320
doesn't matter. It doesn't matter to Massey and it doesn't

18:47.320 --> 18:51.640
matter to the protesters. It's just this narcissism that they

18:51.640 --> 18:55.720
only see the world through what matters to them and their own

18:55.720 --> 19:00.600
perspective and their own Trump derangement syndrome. It's so

19:00.600 --> 19:07.480
on, you know, it's so against liberal values for you to be

19:07.480 --> 19:12.440
choosing to stay quiet and to not support these people

19:12.440 --> 19:16.120
fighting for freedom because you're too afraid that that

19:16.120 --> 19:20.840
might make it look like, you know, you're wearing the wrong

19:20.840 --> 19:25.080
color of the jersey that's supporting your political team.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.160
Yeah, they're the very same people, the people who are

19:27.160 --> 19:29.640
attacking Massey and saying that you're a mouthpiece of

19:29.640 --> 19:31.880
Trump. They're the very same people who went along when

19:31.880 --> 19:36.120
Clinton said that Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian agent. Yes. And

19:36.120 --> 19:39.400
the perspective comes from, I keep bringing up the quote by

19:39.400 --> 19:42.440
AOC when she said that it's more important to be morally

19:42.440 --> 19:47.560
right than factually correct because that is such a obvious

19:47.560 --> 19:52.840
direction that hey, morality as we define it, you have to

19:52.840 --> 19:56.360
submit to it and it doesn't matter what facts is, which is

19:56.360 --> 20:00.440
very similar to religion. That's Islam. I read that and I

20:00.440 --> 20:03.800
was like, she's a fucking mullah. Well, they are

20:03.800 --> 20:07.000
starting or they have started their own version of

20:07.000 --> 20:10.120
fundamentalist religion. I had Peter Boghossian, we talked

20:10.120 --> 20:13.240
about this as well and he agrees that it's a religion.

20:13.240 --> 20:17.320
It's a secular religion. This does not make any sense if you

20:17.320 --> 20:20.920
look at it from a political philosophy perspective. Make

20:20.920 --> 20:24.520
all the sense if you look at it from the religious kind of a

20:24.520 --> 20:29.000
perspective. Before getting into analyzing that though, I

20:29.000 --> 20:32.760
want to hear your experience of being unveiled because I think

20:32.760 --> 20:35.880
I saw one photo of you younger when you were wearing hijab,

20:35.880 --> 20:38.200
but I assume that you've been you've been wearing hijab for

20:38.200 --> 20:41.160
much longer than a couple of years. Yeah. Oh, yeah. So it

20:41.160 --> 20:47.800
was put on me at nine years old and I wore hijab for about 20

20:47.800 --> 20:53.800
years and then I wore or no less than 20 years. I wore it

20:53.800 --> 20:59.320
until I was about 20 and then I wore niqab after that. So

20:59.320 --> 21:04.360
that's the covering of the whole face, even my eyes.

21:04.360 --> 21:07.240
Actually, even my eyes were covered because of the man that

21:07.240 --> 21:10.760
I was married to was

21:12.840 --> 21:16.280
even the eyes needed to be covered. Every inch of skin

21:16.280 --> 21:20.920
needed to be covered according to him. So I looked through a

21:20.920 --> 21:28.280
thin black veil. Basically, that's how I saw the world. So

21:28.280 --> 21:33.800
other than the fact that it's the physical representation

21:33.800 --> 21:40.680
of just the subjugation and the dehumanization, the gender

21:40.680 --> 21:46.760
apartheid, it is all of those things. It is just the

21:46.760 --> 21:52.680
symbol. It's the tool actually. So it's like if you see a

21:52.680 --> 21:58.520
slave and they have shackles on them, you know that the

21:58.520 --> 22:01.720
shackles are just the visual representation of the fact that

22:01.720 --> 22:07.960
this person is a slave. It's if you remove those shackles,

22:07.960 --> 22:14.360
it's the first step for that person to start to find their

22:14.360 --> 22:17.480
own personal freedom and their own personal autonomy. So

22:17.480 --> 22:21.240
really that's what the hijab is. It confines a person in the

22:21.240 --> 22:26.440
same way that shackles can find a slave. It restricts you. I

22:26.440 --> 22:30.840
mean, I talk about the niqab as a personal, it was like a

22:30.840 --> 22:36.040
sensory deprivation chamber, a portable sensory deprivation

22:36.040 --> 22:43.720
chamber where it it reduced my ability to hear, to see, to

22:43.720 --> 22:49.240
speak, to touch, to you know, every every one of my senses,

22:49.240 --> 22:54.680
every one of my everything that makes me human and my ability

22:54.680 --> 22:58.840
to interact and communicate with other humans. All of that

22:58.840 --> 23:05.640
was taken away from me. I didn't even feel like I was part

23:05.640 --> 23:10.440
of humanity. I felt like I was a ghost walking amongst people.

23:10.440 --> 23:14.920
You know, I could see them, but they couldn't see me. I wasn't

23:14.920 --> 23:20.600
part of the world and it's really difficult to explain

23:20.600 --> 23:25.880
what that does to somebody, but essentially, I was rotting

23:25.880 --> 23:31.000
under that cloth. I my my body and soul were rotting under

23:31.000 --> 23:38.280
there and the reason why I fight against the hijab so much

23:38.280 --> 23:41.320
is because not only in my experience, but in so many

23:41.320 --> 23:48.280
women's experiences, I say that you know, you once you free

23:48.280 --> 23:52.840
your head, you can free your mind. It's really just the

23:52.840 --> 23:58.040
first step. Just just breaking off the shackles of the hijab

23:58.040 --> 24:03.240
and then a woman is allowed to start thinking and to start

24:03.240 --> 24:08.600
feeling and to start being and to start just feeling like a

24:08.600 --> 24:12.280
human being. You know, you you can't even do that when you're

24:12.280 --> 24:17.960
still shackled to this garb that forces you to just become

24:17.960 --> 24:23.080
the image of a Muslim woman. You know, you don't have any

24:23.080 --> 24:26.760
personal autonomy. You don't have any individuality. You are

24:26.760 --> 24:32.520
just Muslim woman. That's it. That's how the world sees you.

24:32.520 --> 24:40.440
That's how you see yourself and you know, you just to me, it

24:40.440 --> 24:43.800
was like, you know, I'm trying to explain to my friends what

24:43.800 --> 24:47.320
it feels like and it's like, okay, imagine if you're an emo

24:47.320 --> 24:50.520
and you just want to wear black eyeliner and a black cloak,

24:50.520 --> 24:55.320
but you're forced to wear a pink tutu and have frills in

24:55.320 --> 24:59.800
your hair and stuff like it's it's everybody who looks at

24:59.800 --> 25:02.840
you is going to think, oh, look at this little ballerina and

25:02.840 --> 25:06.440
you're like, I'm not a fucking ballerina. Stop judging me, but

25:06.440 --> 25:09.640
you just you're you're giving that impression out to the

25:09.640 --> 25:16.120
whole world and it's so against who you are on the inside and

25:16.120 --> 25:24.120
it's it's just the most. It's just the most effective way of

25:24.120 --> 25:29.560
constricting and constraining both your body and your mind.

25:29.560 --> 25:32.280
Yeah, and the moment you take it off, you know, the closest

25:32.280 --> 25:36.040
people to you start calling you, I don't know, prostitute and

25:36.040 --> 25:43.000
whore and so the idea is very clear to make women into sexual

25:43.000 --> 25:45.800
objects because that's that's the worth of woman from the

25:45.800 --> 25:51.160
perspective of I would say religiously enabled societies

25:51.160 --> 25:55.000
because the kind of hijab differs from the culture to

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
culture, right? Like Afghanistan have their own

25:57.000 --> 26:00.680
thing. Indonesia have their own thing. Some Muslim women in

26:00.680 --> 26:04.200
Lebanon and Turkey, they're not even wearing anything and so

26:04.200 --> 26:07.400
because of what it represents, the argument of me and a lot of

26:07.400 --> 26:15.240
people like me is that if Mirab or Burka is allowed to be worn

26:15.240 --> 26:21.000
in public places, so should be KKK hoods and Nazi paraphernalia

26:21.000 --> 26:26.200
because you know it represents as you said, it's not just this

26:26.200 --> 26:29.000
thing that people put on their head. It's being placed on

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
their head to represent something, but we seem to be as

26:33.000 --> 26:36.040
you said very very far from really practicing and

26:36.040 --> 26:39.160
appreciating the First Amendment of the United States.

26:39.160 --> 26:41.640
The hypocrisy is just unbelievable. I mean people are

26:41.640 --> 26:46.200
lining up in Washington DC to wear US flag as the hijab not

26:46.200 --> 26:52.200
really realizing what what it symbolizes. That I'm not even

26:52.200 --> 26:57.000
American and that makes me want to throw up. Yeah, I get so

26:57.000 --> 27:03.240
upset disgusted overseeing that you you're taking a symbol of

27:03.240 --> 27:08.360
freedom of liberty. People have you know how many lives have

27:08.360 --> 27:13.000
been lost over fighting for this freedom and you're taking

27:13.000 --> 27:19.960
that symbol and you're just you're you're defacing it by

27:19.960 --> 27:25.560
forcing it into the most polar opposite of freedom. You know

27:25.560 --> 27:28.840
it's the most disgusting possible thing that they could

27:28.840 --> 27:33.080
have done with the American flag. Absolutely. Well, I mean

27:33.080 --> 27:36.120
people behind it like Linda Sarsour and all those people

27:36.120 --> 27:38.360
there. It's clear where they're coming from. It's just a lack

27:38.360 --> 27:43.000
of education whether intentionally or

27:43.000 --> 27:46.920
unintentionally of a lot of people in the left who seem to

27:46.920 --> 27:49.880
have welcomed a lot of people like Linda Sarsour to energize

27:49.880 --> 27:54.280
their base and again, you know it has precedent that you lose

27:54.280 --> 27:58.040
control and as you said, Islamists are coming from far

27:58.040 --> 28:02.200
more firm and solid ideologically speaking place

28:02.200 --> 28:05.880
than the leftists. So, it's an unwitting kind of a battle and

28:05.880 --> 28:09.880
unwitting kind of a war which begs the question. What do you

28:09.880 --> 28:12.600
think is going to happen with the future of Islam and Muslims

28:12.600 --> 28:16.440
in the western world because people are waking up in the

28:16.440 --> 28:20.360
west and they're not buying into a lot of bullshit that has

28:20.360 --> 28:24.600
been coming to them from relatively speaking limited

28:24.600 --> 28:29.160
channels of interpretation and distribution of information.

28:29.160 --> 28:33.880
That's really well said. So, those limited channels were

28:33.880 --> 28:36.280
basically like the Muslim Brotherhood, right? They had the

28:36.280 --> 28:39.720
money. They had the ability. They were able to create people

28:39.720 --> 28:45.080
like Linda Sarsour who was able to gain prominence because

28:45.080 --> 28:49.560
the Obama administration gave her some White House champions

28:49.560 --> 28:53.480
of change award. Do you know what I mean? So, they were able

28:53.480 --> 29:00.200
to control the narrative for so long and now there are voices

29:00.200 --> 29:04.920
like yours and mine that cannot be held back anymore because

29:04.920 --> 29:08.680
we're on Twitter. We're on YouTube. We're on social media.

29:08.680 --> 29:14.520
We don't have to be on MSNBC. We don't need to be you know to

29:14.520 --> 29:19.160
get a call from BBC or CNN. We can get our voices out there in

29:19.160 --> 29:25.160
different ways. So, they no longer have a monopoly on that

29:25.160 --> 29:30.440
narrative anymore. So, we can come out and we can start to

29:30.440 --> 29:33.400
give a counter narrative to what they've been hearing this

29:33.400 --> 29:36.360
whole time. So, they've been hearing things like you know,

29:36.360 --> 29:40.360
Islam is a religion of peace. That's a very hard thing to

29:40.360 --> 29:46.440
sell when you guys you know like how do you sell Islam is a

29:46.440 --> 29:49.320
religion of peace when you're going around stabbing people on

29:49.320 --> 29:53.000
every bridge in London or your trucks of peace are are running

29:53.000 --> 29:57.800
over people or you're killing each other in Iraq and in Syria

29:57.800 --> 30:02.840
like or the Yazidis being taken as sex slaves and all that with

30:02.840 --> 30:07.320
the the the truth coming out in the media, it's making people

30:07.320 --> 30:10.520
start to question this narrative that they've been fed

30:10.520 --> 30:14.760
and that they've swallowed for so long and when they start to

30:14.760 --> 30:17.160
question and they start to look for answers, that's when they

30:17.160 --> 30:20.440
find people like us and so that's why I think that what

30:20.440 --> 30:25.400
we're doing is really valuable in changing that narrative and

30:25.400 --> 30:32.840
in shifting that Islamist perspective to more of an honest

30:32.840 --> 30:36.040
perspective of what it's like in the Muslim world. So, people

30:36.040 --> 30:39.240
like Linda Sarsour are is you know, she's the kind of person

30:39.240 --> 30:43.320
who would sell the garbage of the hijab means empowerment and

30:43.320 --> 30:46.360
the hijab means feminism, right? And so, now, you're

30:46.360 --> 30:49.880
going to have we have no hijab day and we have free from hijab

30:49.880 --> 30:54.840
and you have women in Iran that are risking their lives and

30:54.840 --> 30:58.600
putting the hijab on a stick and going to prison and all of

30:58.600 --> 31:02.360
that stuff is countering the garbage that they have been

31:02.360 --> 31:07.880
feeding people for so long and so, I think that at the end of

31:07.880 --> 31:14.920
the day, just rational minded people and truth will prevail.

31:14.920 --> 31:18.760
Yeah, the big picture ideal seems to be for Islam, the

31:18.760 --> 31:21.720
doctrine of Islam to be reformed but we know that Islam

31:21.720 --> 31:26.440
is also unique in that respect that it is said that it is the

31:26.440 --> 31:32.280
final world of word of god and it cannot be reformed and it's

31:32.280 --> 31:35.480
it's very sinister and very genius in that respect that

31:35.480 --> 31:39.000
they put it that they this is it. It's not like no other

31:39.000 --> 31:41.800
religion came after Islam, you know, it's just that anybody

31:41.800 --> 31:44.680
that they could, they killed for this religion to have

31:44.680 --> 31:49.080
monopoly on this. So, the question would be because Islam

31:49.080 --> 31:52.520
cannot be reformed in a fundamental kind of a way and

31:52.520 --> 31:56.200
because there is an awakening especially within the Muslim

31:56.200 --> 32:01.800
communities, you know, it's not only Iran. I was reading that

32:01.800 --> 32:05.320
Arabic translation of the God Delusion by Richard Dawkins,

32:05.320 --> 32:09.080
what 10,000 times downloaded or a million times downloaded in

32:09.080 --> 32:13.240
Saudi Arabia or something like that. So, you know, because

32:13.240 --> 32:16.760
truth is is uncompromising, you know, when you hear it, it

32:16.760 --> 32:19.480
resonates with you. You can struggle with it. You don't have

32:19.480 --> 32:22.120
to sell it. You're not selling the truth. It's just the

32:22.120 --> 32:26.040
truth. It's easy. It's it's it's the truth. So, what's going

32:26.040 --> 32:29.880
to happen with this? I ask Salman this question to you that

32:29.880 --> 32:33.640
the dynamic between Westerners and Muslims, what is going to

32:33.640 --> 32:37.880
happen moving forward because it's not that people are going

32:37.880 --> 32:41.480
to respect, hey, are we going to call you an Islamophobe? So,

32:41.480 --> 32:43.960
you're going to shut the **** up because people have seen

32:43.960 --> 32:47.000
people like me and you being called Islamophobe and racist

32:47.000 --> 32:49.320
and then we talk about it like what the hell are you talking

32:49.320 --> 32:54.280
about Islam? What does that even mean Islamophobe? So, what

32:54.280 --> 32:58.120
do you see is going to happen between the dynamic between

32:58.120 --> 33:00.680
Islam and the Western culture because there are a lot of

33:00.680 --> 33:04.760
Muslims in the West, some believers, many not believers

33:04.760 --> 33:10.360
and Islamists are taking advantage of this imbalance

33:10.360 --> 33:13.240
between really knowing about what Islam is and between the

33:13.240 --> 33:15.400
ideals the leftists have created for the Western

33:15.400 --> 33:21.400
civilization. Well, I mean, I may be an eternal optimist but

33:21.400 --> 33:25.560
I actually see Islamists losing their foothold. It may be

33:25.560 --> 33:30.440
top down but we are greater in number and Islam may not ever

33:30.440 --> 33:35.800
be reformed. I agree with you but I think Muslims will choose

33:35.800 --> 33:39.960
to cherry pick their religion and they will choose to follow

33:39.960 --> 33:45.240
only the parts of the religion that match their values. So,

33:45.240 --> 33:50.040
they they will start to ignore all of the sexist verses and

33:50.040 --> 33:53.960
all of the racist verses or all of the just scientifically

33:53.960 --> 33:58.360
stupid verses like, you know, the the the earth is as flat as

33:58.360 --> 34:01.400
a carpet and all of those things. They're gonna ignore

34:01.400 --> 34:05.720
all that stuff. Sure, there's people in Saudi Arabia today

34:05.720 --> 34:09.800
drinking camel urine but generally, Muslims ignore those

34:09.800 --> 34:13.000
kinds of verses like we're already ignoring a lot of the

34:13.000 --> 34:17.480
stupid things in the religion. So, we're just gonna continue

34:17.480 --> 34:21.960
doing that. I think and you can see it, you know, some mosques

34:21.960 --> 34:26.040
are starting up where they're LGBT safe. Some women are

34:26.040 --> 34:29.480
saying, I wanna be an imam and I wanna read the Quran. You

34:29.480 --> 34:32.040
know what I mean? Like, they're pushing the envelope in all

34:32.040 --> 34:35.160
sorts of different ways and I fully and completely support

34:35.160 --> 34:38.920
them but you know, unfortunately, you can only see

34:38.920 --> 34:41.880
those kinds of things happening in the western world where

34:41.880 --> 34:46.120
people have the freedom to to do these things. Still, under

34:46.120 --> 34:51.240
dictatorships, under Sharia countries, you don't see those

34:51.240 --> 34:55.560
changes happening quite as much. Well, quite as publicly

34:55.560 --> 35:01.320
because there's so much more danger in doing that. So, I

35:01.320 --> 35:05.480
think what the western world needs to do is to support

35:05.480 --> 35:09.560
people that are trying to separate mosque and state. So,

35:09.560 --> 35:14.120
our biggest responsibility now in the west is to support the

35:14.120 --> 35:17.240
Iranian protest protesters who are trying to bring down the

35:17.240 --> 35:22.760
Islamic regime. That is where we should be. 100% behind them

35:22.760 --> 35:27.560
and behind people in Sudan who want democracy and behind

35:27.560 --> 35:31.000
people in Egypt who want democracy and behind people in

35:31.000 --> 35:36.280
Iraq who want democracy. In the past, unfortunately, you know,

35:36.280 --> 35:41.000
not only in Iran but in in Egypt as well, the west has

35:41.000 --> 35:43.640
always supported the fundamentalist Muslim

35:43.640 --> 35:48.920
governments to come in and we need to stop doing that. We

35:48.920 --> 35:52.520
need to start supporting democratic governments. We

35:52.520 --> 35:55.720
need to start supporting the people when they want their

35:55.720 --> 36:01.800
freedom and I think that's hopefully that's the shift. I

36:01.800 --> 36:08.200
think what's happening in Iran right now is so incredibly I

36:08.200 --> 36:14.840
mean, it's both really sad and heartbreaking and angering but

36:14.840 --> 36:20.840
at the same time, it's just awe inspiring and it really as

36:20.840 --> 36:23.080
they say, you know, sometimes things have to get worse before

36:23.080 --> 36:27.160
they can get better. I've always said, you know,

36:27.160 --> 36:31.000
especially about Iranian women that they're just superhuman

36:31.000 --> 36:35.320
like it's phenomenal. I don't even know where they're like

36:35.320 --> 36:40.920
Amazonian. I can't even I can't fathom their bravery, you

36:40.920 --> 36:50.120
know, and so I feel like they are going to be the ones to

36:50.120 --> 36:55.800
start this trend and to start, you know, if you can if you can

36:55.800 --> 37:00.600
topple the Islamic regime in Iran, anything after that is

37:00.600 --> 37:05.640
easy. So, if they can do it and people around the Islamic world

37:05.640 --> 37:09.160
see them do it, they're going to feel like our job is going to

37:09.160 --> 37:13.240
be so much easier if they did it, we can do it too and I

37:13.240 --> 37:17.000
think that's kind of what happened with me and people like

37:17.000 --> 37:20.040
Salman Rushdie and Ayaan Hirsi Ali and a lot of other ex

37:20.040 --> 37:24.280
Muslims is we saw like if Salman Rushdie can do it or if

37:24.280 --> 37:28.200
Ayaan Hirsi Ali can do it, then I can do it too. Of course, I

37:28.200 --> 37:33.640
didn't have somebody, you know, stab a death threat into

37:33.640 --> 37:37.000
another person's body, a death threat against me. You know

37:37.000 --> 37:40.360
what I mean? Like it and she still is out there and she's

37:40.360 --> 37:44.360
still writing books and she's still speaking. So, it gives

37:44.360 --> 37:49.640
you hope in human resilience and human spirit and you feel

37:49.640 --> 37:53.480
like, you know, like they say, you can't be what you cannot

37:53.480 --> 37:58.360
see. So, I think that we're all going to look to Iran as that

37:58.360 --> 38:06.680
example and I hope that it will continue to topple the Islamic

38:06.680 --> 38:09.240
governments and it will continue this trend of

38:09.240 --> 38:12.840
separation of mosque and state and then just once the people

38:12.840 --> 38:17.160
are free, I mean, the world just is just going to it's such a

38:17.160 --> 38:21.640
it's going to be such a gift, the art and music and talent

38:21.640 --> 38:27.240
and just all of the the the the intellect and the amazing minds

38:27.240 --> 38:31.160
that have been suppressed and not part of the world. It's all

38:31.160 --> 38:33.880
going to come out and it's it's going to be, you know, I hope I

38:33.880 --> 38:37.080
live to see it. Yeah, same here and it really comes down to

38:37.080 --> 38:39.960
free flow of information, right? Even here, you see

38:39.960 --> 38:43.720
someone like Kamala Harris suggests that Twitter shut down

38:43.720 --> 38:46.680
Donald Trump's account. Well, why is she saying that? She's

38:46.680 --> 38:49.480
saying that to shut down an argument that disagrees with

38:49.480 --> 38:52.360
her and if they can't remove president of the United States,

38:52.360 --> 38:55.320
they can't remove anyone else who disagrees with them and

38:55.320 --> 38:59.800
this way of thinking has been unfortunately institutionalized

38:59.800 --> 39:03.960
in Iran for the past over 40 years. Not that Shah was all,

39:03.960 --> 39:06.200
you know, bright and everything because anything that happens

39:06.200 --> 39:09.560
is a consequence of the process that's, you know, that's

39:09.560 --> 39:12.440
been going on for far longer. Yasmeen's book is called

39:12.440 --> 39:16.600
Unveiled How Western Liberals Empower Radical Islam. We talked

39:16.600 --> 39:19.320
a lot about the US but we haven't talked about Canada.

39:19.320 --> 39:22.680
You live in Canada. I lived in Canada for 11 years. I cannot

39:22.680 --> 39:28.920
stand liberals and Trudeau. I spent maybe about a year

39:28.920 --> 39:32.440
campaigning against liberals and Trudeau and try to explain

39:32.440 --> 39:36.200
in any shape or form I could that this is not about racism.

39:36.200 --> 39:40.200
This is not about the we don't like diversity and all of that.

39:40.200 --> 39:43.960
This is about these people are destroying a country for the

39:43.960 --> 39:48.040
sake of legitimacy that they do not have. So, how do you see it

39:48.040 --> 39:52.200
with respect to liberals and Trudeau? Oh, I 100% agree with

39:52.200 --> 39:55.720
you. I've also spoke. I speak out against Trudeau all the

39:55.720 --> 40:00.200
time. It's so much now that I'm actually like I'm just sick of

40:00.200 --> 40:05.080
him. Yes, I can't even hear his voice. I can't see his face. I

40:05.080 --> 40:08.040
don't even want to talk about him anymore because I'm so

40:08.040 --> 40:12.200
disheartened that he became the prime minister again. Like I

40:12.200 --> 40:17.880
used to speak out against him a lot more before but now

40:17.880 --> 40:20.200
it's almost like I'm in this state of denial. Like I don't

40:20.200 --> 40:23.560
even want to believe that that he's still our prime minister.

40:23.560 --> 40:29.160
It's it's everything that you said but it's also ironic that

40:29.160 --> 40:32.680
these same people that are afraid that we are the ones us

40:32.680 --> 40:36.440
with our brown skin from our Middle Eastern background that

40:36.440 --> 40:41.480
we are the ones that you have to fear that we might be racist

40:41.480 --> 40:45.400
and that we might be bigoted against Muslims. Meanwhile,

40:45.400 --> 40:48.840
this **** is the one that's been in blackface three times.

40:48.840 --> 40:52.600
You know what I mean? Like he's the one who you should be

40:52.600 --> 40:56.600
worried about racism from. The fact of the matter is people

40:56.600 --> 41:02.680
like Justin Trudeau do not care about human beings. They only

41:02.680 --> 41:10.200
care about votes. So, if he's gonna support secular Muslims

41:10.200 --> 41:14.440
or ex-Muslims, that's a very small group but if he's gonna

41:14.440 --> 41:17.640
support fundamentalist or conservative Muslims, that's a

41:17.640 --> 41:20.760
much larger voting block and that's all it comes down to

41:20.760 --> 41:24.200
for him. He could give less of a **** about feminism. He's

41:24.200 --> 41:28.360
pretending to be a feminist. He is how is he a feminist yet at

41:28.360 --> 41:30.840
the same time, he's selling arms to Saudi Arabia. What do

41:30.840 --> 41:36.040
you think Saudi Arabia is gonna do with those people? Yeah,

41:36.040 --> 41:39.400
look how they're killing everybody in Yemen and and then

41:39.400 --> 41:43.560
that he takes selfies with the refugees that he has created,

41:43.560 --> 41:48.200
right? It's just on the campaign trail. He is as fake and as

41:48.200 --> 41:52.680
shallow and as just like the quintessential disgusting

41:52.680 --> 41:55.720
politician. I have absolutely nothing positive to say about

41:55.720 --> 42:01.080
him. In the past, I used to think that he was just dumb but

42:01.080 --> 42:03.400
you know, it's kind of like what you said at the beginning

42:03.400 --> 42:07.320
of this this interview when you talked about the road to hell

42:07.320 --> 42:13.800
is paved with good intentions. That ignorance, the fact that

42:13.800 --> 42:19.320
he's so dumb is so dangerous when he is the leader of a

42:19.320 --> 42:22.440
country. So, I can't even just dismiss him as an idiot

42:22.440 --> 42:27.320
anymore because he is an incredibly dangerous idiot and

42:27.320 --> 42:30.360
you know, just the way he's been reacting now with the

42:30.360 --> 42:35.160
protesters in Iran that just solidifies, you know, my

42:35.160 --> 42:39.720
disgust for him. It it his response was of no surprise to

42:39.720 --> 42:44.040
me and I'm just ashamed. I'm ashamed that that he is the

42:44.040 --> 42:47.960
leader. I'm ashamed that he became the leader again and to

42:47.960 --> 42:51.000
be perfectly honest, I think it has a lot to do with the fact

42:51.000 --> 42:56.680
that our conservative government just did not offer

42:56.680 --> 43:01.400
the right counterweight to Trudeau. So, in the same way

43:01.400 --> 43:05.160
where, you know, people in the US were saying about Hillary,

43:05.160 --> 43:08.200
they're like, how horrible of a person does she have to be to

43:08.200 --> 43:12.040
lose to Trump? It's the same thing about Trudeau. Like how

43:12.040 --> 43:15.320
bad did Scheer have to be to lose to Trudeau? Nobody liked

43:15.320 --> 43:20.920
him. Yep. But you know, in Canada, we have everybody is

43:20.920 --> 43:24.360
left. We have left more left and even more left. Those are

43:24.360 --> 43:28.520
our parties, you know, and so even our conservatives are

43:28.520 --> 43:31.320
left. Our conservative party is more left than Bernie Sanders

43:31.320 --> 43:37.480
for goodness sake. So, we're already far off the scale but

43:37.480 --> 43:40.600
what happened with our conservative government is that

43:40.600 --> 43:47.160
they did not stand up strong for Western and liberal values.

43:47.160 --> 43:50.040
They didn't do that. Unfortunately, the conservative

43:50.040 --> 43:53.800
governments before them did do that. So, under Stephen Harper,

43:53.800 --> 44:00.360
he had he was very clear. He had a hotline where he created

44:00.360 --> 44:03.720
the hotline for people to speak out and to call, you know, if

44:03.720 --> 44:07.400
you're being forced into a marriage, FGM, he called it like

44:07.400 --> 44:10.840
barbaric acts, you know, things like that. You call this hotline,

44:10.840 --> 44:15.800
you ask for help, you get support for the women under

44:15.800 --> 44:19.560
these regimes, you know, not just Islamic but whether it's

44:19.560 --> 44:25.320
Sikh or Hindu or whatever else. If you feel like you're being

44:25.320 --> 44:28.680
forced into a situation that you don't wanna be in, here is

44:28.680 --> 44:31.320
an anonymous hotline that you can make this phone call and

44:31.320 --> 44:36.360
you can get some support. Trudeau came in and he removed

44:36.360 --> 44:41.960
that hotline and when whereas Harper in the past would talk

44:41.960 --> 44:45.880
about, you know, FGM wasn't allowed in candidates against

44:45.880 --> 44:49.160
the law. It's a barbaric act. You have Trudeau coming in and

44:49.160 --> 44:53.800
saying, oh, cutting a girl's genitals with a razor. We don't

44:53.800 --> 44:57.320
wanna call that barbaric. That's that's a terrible word to

44:57.320 --> 45:00.360
use. Well, if you don't call that barbaric, then what is

45:00.360 --> 45:04.440
barbaric? What could possibly be more barbaric than that? And

45:04.440 --> 45:07.400
who would call it barbaric if it's not the Prime Minister of

45:07.400 --> 45:13.800
Canada? Yes, that's right. So, it's just like we should have,

45:13.800 --> 45:17.720
we needed a stronger conservative government that

45:17.720 --> 45:21.880
looked to the Canadian people and said, we will defend your

45:21.880 --> 45:29.000
values. We will defend, you know, freedom of speech, LGBT

45:29.000 --> 45:32.360
equality. That was a big thing because our conservative

45:32.360 --> 45:35.560
leader wouldn't go to any pride parades and and he was

45:35.560 --> 45:39.720
talking about abortion and stuff like that. Like these are

45:39.720 --> 45:43.400
not conversations in Canada. They might be conversations in

45:43.400 --> 45:46.280
the US. They are not conversations in Canada.

45:46.280 --> 45:52.680
Everybody is way beyond. You know, we believe in LGBT

45:52.680 --> 45:57.640
equality across the board and to have somebody running for

45:57.640 --> 46:03.480
Prime Minister who was wishy washy on that topic. It was

46:03.480 --> 46:07.720
detrimental to him. Yeah, not only they didn't stand up for

46:07.720 --> 46:12.600
Western values, they jeopardize them because yes, Salim Mansoor

46:12.600 --> 46:16.520
I think is a very good example how this is a Muslim

46:16.520 --> 46:20.280
professor who has been talking against Islamic radicalism and

46:20.280 --> 46:24.840
all that and he wanted to run as a conservative but he got

46:24.840 --> 46:27.640
kicked out because they're like, oh, there's a threat of us

46:27.640 --> 46:30.360
being called Islamophobic because of Salim Mansoor and he

46:30.360 --> 46:33.000
joined People's Party of Canada, which I believe is a

46:33.000 --> 46:37.000
populist party. I voted for them not because of any specific

46:37.000 --> 46:39.320
kind of a person for the kind of principles that they're

46:39.320 --> 46:41.800
talking about because no one else is talking about freedom

46:41.800 --> 46:45.560
of speech and it's incredibly important when the other side

46:45.560 --> 46:48.360
of the argument is saying we have to regulate social media.

46:48.360 --> 46:50.360
I'm not saying that they're going to be successful doing

46:50.360 --> 46:56.040
that, but it's the perspective that hey, it's a monopoly on

46:56.040 --> 46:59.880
the narrative and that is being determined by the left. It

46:59.880 --> 47:03.480
just it doesn't seem to be very sustainable and to the credit

47:03.480 --> 47:06.600
of majority of Canadian people, I think it's important to say

47:06.600 --> 47:11.560
that liberals won the smallest minority in history of Canada

47:11.560 --> 47:15.320
with less than 33%, which shows what a messed up electoral

47:15.320 --> 47:18.920
system Canada has that I was watching it live. You know,

47:18.920 --> 47:21.800
they went through maybe three province, four provinces in the

47:21.800 --> 47:24.840
east and oh, okay, this is the power dynamic. This is who's

47:24.840 --> 47:27.480
in charge. So what about the west? No wonder they want to

47:27.480 --> 47:31.560
split, you know, that always. Yeah, I live in the west coast

47:31.560 --> 47:34.200
and yeah, that's that's always the way it is. You're in

47:34.200 --> 47:37.480
Vancouver, right? Yeah. Oh, that's a beautiful place. I

47:37.480 --> 47:40.760
lived in Vancouver for a year and a half. I went to Vancouver

47:40.760 --> 47:44.280
film school studied sound design. Yeah, but it's been

47:44.280 --> 47:46.920
like more than half of my school year experimenting with

47:46.920 --> 47:50.360
psychedelics. Yeah, and we have a lot of that here too. Yeah,

47:50.360 --> 47:54.600
that was very helpful for me though, because you know, I got

47:54.600 --> 47:57.000
from the place of anything that has anything to do with

47:57.000 --> 48:01.240
religion is awful to be able to look at churches and even mosque

48:01.240 --> 48:07.080
and separate the architectural and artistic values from the

48:07.080 --> 48:11.560
ideological aspect of it. This is very helpful to me and you

48:11.560 --> 48:14.120
know, I think people in the Middle East, they need acid and

48:14.120 --> 48:19.720
mushrooms more than yeah. Yeah, they need to be removed from

48:19.720 --> 48:23.880
that for a while to get that fresh perspective because it's

48:23.880 --> 48:26.840
easier for I mean, I went through the same thing you're

48:26.840 --> 48:28.920
describing. I mean, I didn't have any psychedelics to help

48:28.920 --> 48:32.840
me, but it went through the same process of just I I hated

48:32.840 --> 48:36.600
the sound of the language Arabic. I didn't want to hear

48:36.600 --> 48:39.320
it. I didn't want to see Arab people. I didn't want to eat

48:39.320 --> 48:41.640
Arab food. I wouldn't even eat Greek food because it was

48:41.640 --> 48:48.280
similar to Arabic food like I ended up lumping the whole Arab

48:48.280 --> 48:51.480
culture in with Islam and just making it one in the same and

48:51.480 --> 48:56.440
that was unfair. You know now over so much time, I've been

48:56.440 --> 49:00.440
able to gain a perspective and appreciation for Arabic music

49:00.440 --> 49:05.880
again and Arabic culture minus all of the religious stuff, but

49:05.880 --> 49:09.160
yeah, it takes a long time. It's almost like it's triggering.

49:09.160 --> 49:12.760
It's almost like PTSD. You know as soon as you see that stuff,

49:12.760 --> 49:15.240
you're like no fuck it fuck all of it like you just don't

49:15.240 --> 49:19.560
want any of it in your life, but I think that people in the

49:19.560 --> 49:23.560
Middle East are so immersed in it. So their hate is a lot

49:23.560 --> 49:28.360
more visceral right now, but if they can just be removed from

49:28.360 --> 49:34.280
it for a while, then they can start to appreciate you know

49:34.280 --> 49:37.720
the value that it can bring minus all of that garbage.

49:37.720 --> 49:42.040
You're lucky in Iran that you have that you've sustained your

49:42.040 --> 49:47.720
Persian culture right like my family is from Egypt. They call

49:47.720 --> 49:51.240
themselves Arabs like it's called the Arab Republic of

49:51.240 --> 49:54.280
Egypt. What the fuck does it have to do? It's in Africa.

49:54.280 --> 49:59.080
It has nothing to do with Arabs. They lost the language,

49:59.080 --> 50:03.080
the religion, the culture. The only thing we know about Egypt

50:03.080 --> 50:05.960
is the stuff that the British people care about with the

50:05.960 --> 50:10.440
ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and stuff like that. Egyptians

50:10.440 --> 50:13.560
themselves don't care about any of that. They don't value

50:13.560 --> 50:17.800
anything to do with their real culture. You know in Morocco,

50:17.800 --> 50:20.360
you can see a little bit of the Berber stuff that has still

50:20.360 --> 50:26.040
been upheld, but so many countries have lost their

50:26.040 --> 50:32.280
pre-Islamic culture and it's you know I'm just saying Iran

50:32.280 --> 50:36.440
like you guys are lucky that you have been able to to

50:36.440 --> 50:39.480
sustain it somewhat so you have something else that's

50:39.480 --> 50:42.280
beautiful about your country that has nothing to do with

50:42.280 --> 50:46.760
Islam. Yeah and a lot of people you know have died trying to

50:46.760 --> 50:49.960
preserve that culture and a lot of people. Iran is a very

50:49.960 --> 50:54.040
very nationalist kind of a country. I sometimes have this

50:54.040 --> 50:57.960
conversation with people here that even whatever you want to

50:57.960 --> 51:01.880
call racism or nationalism in a negative aspect of it that is

51:01.880 --> 51:06.440
very alive and well in Iran as a mainstream, but perhaps that

51:06.440 --> 51:09.240
element is something that has preserved the Iranian culture

51:09.240 --> 51:12.120
because this is funny actually when Trump was talking about

51:12.120 --> 51:16.200
having 52 targets, including cultural targets in Iran. This

51:16.200 --> 51:20.360
was brought up that one of Khomeini loyalists, Khal Khali,

51:20.360 --> 51:24.760
he wanted to bowl those down person after the success of the

51:24.760 --> 51:27.880
revolution and people lined up in front of it held hands so

51:27.880 --> 51:32.040
they couldn't do it. So definitely nationalism and a

51:32.040 --> 51:35.000
lot of these Islamists within the Islamic Republic regime

51:35.000 --> 51:40.760
like Ahmadinejad people they are trying to take this Iranian

51:40.760 --> 51:44.280
nationalism and mix it with Shiism to create something new

51:44.280 --> 51:47.080
out of it because they understand that this version of

51:47.080 --> 51:51.800
Shiism theocracy this is done like people not buying into it

51:51.800 --> 51:54.520
at all, but we'll see what's going to happen. It's a sad

51:54.520 --> 51:58.200
state of affair in Iran, but hey, as you said people need to

51:58.200 --> 52:01.080
do what they need to do the way that they need to do it. I am

52:01.080 --> 52:06.680
not in favor of any kind of a war or Western intervention

52:06.680 --> 52:10.040
yet. I'm absolutely in favor of US coming out of the nuclear

52:10.040 --> 52:12.360
deal. I mean, how are you going to deal with the Islamic

52:12.360 --> 52:16.120
regime? They're liars. You know you cannot trust them, but in

52:16.120 --> 52:19.480
unique time unique times to be alive and having our

52:19.480 --> 52:25.560
perspective really. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yasmeen's book is called

52:25.560 --> 52:29.160
Unveiled How Western Liberals Empower Radical Islam. What is

52:29.160 --> 52:35.480
next for you and where can our audience follow your work? So

52:35.480 --> 52:41.720
right now, I am going all across Canada, US, Australia,

52:41.720 --> 52:46.680
Europe, some parts of Asia even promoting my book. So I'll be

52:46.680 --> 52:50.840
if people go to my website yasmeenmuhammad.com and they

52:50.840 --> 52:54.920
subscribe to my newsletter, then they can see where I'll be and

52:54.920 --> 52:57.640
when and then hopefully they can come out and see me and

52:57.640 --> 53:01.960
support and get a signed copy of my book and the other thing

53:01.960 --> 53:05.240
that I'm working on is my organization Free Hearts Free

53:05.240 --> 53:11.080
Minds, which is all about supporting people from the

53:11.080 --> 53:15.320
living in the Muslim world who have left Islam and we're

53:15.320 --> 53:17.720
always looking for donations so people are interested in going

53:17.720 --> 53:20.280
to that website and taking a look at the testimonials and

53:20.280 --> 53:23.960
seeing how we've helped people. That would be fantastic and

53:23.960 --> 53:27.800
you can find me on Twitter where I'm usually pretty active

53:27.800 --> 53:36.040
and yeah. Your Twitter handle is at yasmeenmuhammadxx. I've

53:36.040 --> 53:41.080
put it under your name so our audience can see it. This was

53:41.080 --> 53:43.480
awesome having you. Thank you so much for your time. Let me

53:43.480 --> 53:46.680
ask you the last question that I ask all my guests that if you

53:46.680 --> 53:49.560
come across an intelligent alien from a different

53:49.560 --> 53:53.160
civilization, what would you say is the worst thing humanity

53:53.160 --> 53:55.560
has done and what would you say is humanity's greatest

53:55.560 --> 53:58.120
achievement?

53:59.720 --> 54:05.320
The worst thing we have done is up for debate. I think we've

54:05.320 --> 54:08.840
done a lot of horrible things, but I think that our best

54:08.840 --> 54:13.240
achievement is that we continue to move forward that no matter

54:13.240 --> 54:18.600
how bad things are, we generally are always moving

54:18.600 --> 54:23.800
forward. We don't consistently move forward like sometimes we

54:23.800 --> 54:29.320
take one step back, but I think in general, I have a lot of

54:29.320 --> 54:36.920
faith in humanity and our resilience and I think that's

54:36.920 --> 54:40.440
the best thing about us is that we're still willing to

54:40.440 --> 54:43.480
persevere.

55:10.440 --> 55:14.120
Thank you.
