1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
Once you free your head, you can free your mind. It's really just

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,680
the first step, just just breaking off the shackles of the

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:15,520
hijab. And then a woman is allowed to start thinking and to

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:21,320
start feeling and to start being and to start just feeling like a

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,320
human being, you know, you can't even do that when you're still

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,000
shackled to this garb that forces you to just become the

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,800
image of a Muslim woman. You know, you don't have any

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,400
personal autonomy. You don't have any individuality. You are

9
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:45,000
just Muslim woman. That's it. That's how the world sees you.

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,840
That's how you see yourself.

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:59,040
Hello, and welcome to the 60th episode of a new human podcast.

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,680
I'm a Ghabha Hari, a geologist on Twitter and Instagram. And you

13
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,000
can follow this podcast on liveinlimbo.com, iTunes, YouTube

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,320

15
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,840
welcome to Neo Human Podcast, Yasmeen.

16
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,640
Thank you very much for having me.

17
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,520
Absolute pleasure. You're one of those people that I've been

18
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,880
thinking about having for a long time, had ex Muslims before,

19
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,600
tried to get Ayaan Hirsi Ali number of times, complete failure

20
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,200
on that front. But you know, it's happening. It's happening.

21
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,160
So it's a pleasure to have you. Let's start with your

22
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,120
background for those of our audience who don't know who you

23
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,320
are, the work you've done, lives you've lived, and what are you

24
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,880
mainly focused on now these days?

25
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,320
Okay. So I grew up in a fundamentalist Muslim

26
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:56,200
household. I was forced into a marriage with an al-Qaeda agent,

27
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,560
got away from him. We had a daughter together. So I got my

28
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,400
myself and my daughter away from him.

29
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,680
Which country were you in?

30
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:11,720
Canada. This was all in Canada. Okay. Yeah. And then I started

31
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,880
going to university, took a history of religions course,

32
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,960
where I was finally allowed to talk about Islam and question

33
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,400
it and, you know, think critically about it. And so of

34
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,000
course, that led to me leaving the religion. And I was quietly

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,840
an ex-Muslim for a long time, because of course, you know, the

36
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:40,280
punishment for leaving Islam is execution. And so I lived like

37
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,800
that quietly for a long time until the infamous episode of

38
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,920
Bill Maher with Sam Harris and Ben Affleck, where they, Ben

39
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,040
Affleck called them gross and racist. And that sort of

40
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,680
encouraged me to start speaking up. I felt like I agreed with

41
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,120
everything that Sam and Bill had to say, but the two men were

42
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,520
being attacked. Basically, they're being attacked for being

43
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,320
white male Americans. So I said, you know, I'm going to say the

44
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,880
same thing as them, but I'm going to be a brown female Arab.

45
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,640
And so now people are going to be forced to address the actual

46
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:26,240
message that as opposed to just stopping and being, you know,

47
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,880
stuck on the identity of the messenger. And so then I decided

48
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,040
I was going to start writing my book. And so I started writing a

49
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:42,920
blog, first of all, and I was still anonymous at the time. So

50
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,560
the blog was called Confessions of an Ex-Muslim. And I started

51
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,640
getting messages from all over the Muslim majority world from

52
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,000
men and women that were very happy that I was speaking out,

53
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,000
and were asking me to basically be their voice. And then I

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,440
started to feel really ashamed that these are people that are

55
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,360
living in countries where they could be executed for speaking

56
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,800
out. And here I am living in the free West, afraid to show my

57
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:19,320
face. And so I decided to go public. And this was all about

58
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,480
three years ago, and I finally got my book published. And it is

59
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,720
called Unveiled, How Western Liberals Empower Radicalists

60
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:34,520
Islam. And what a title. What a title. Spot on. Sam helped me

61
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,680
with that. And then I also started an organization called

62
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,920
Free Hearts, Free Minds, which supports people who have left

63
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,760
Islam, but are still stuck in Muslim majority countries. So if

64
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,360
you go to that website and click on testimonials, you can read

65
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,480
from people who we have helped over the past year.

66
00:04:53,480 --> 00:05:00,280
Now, we have a lot in common. I was born in Iran. We talked

67
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,080
about it briefly before coming live, that you would be interested

68
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,680
to know about my background as well. I was born in Iran, born

69
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,120
into a family that was marked as Shia Muslim, because their

70
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,920
parents were Shia Muslim, and their parents were Shia Muslim.

71
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,440
And therefore, I always say that I was one second old,

72
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,800
automatically it was, you know, the labels that were have placed

73
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:29,000
on me, I was a straight male Iranian Shia Muslim. And good

74
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,400
luck getting rid of any of those, because they come with

75
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,000
the expectations that are built within that society, not only

76
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,120
the theocracy, but also the society and the family

77
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,320
structure. And so when you mentioned Ben Affleck, one thing

78
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,440
that stands out is that how he mentioned that, well, I was

79
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,240
saying something like this, you're offending 1.7 billion

80
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,120
Muslims. But the idea that once you're born into this religion,

81
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,480
there is no way out of it, unless you're willing to risk

82
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,400
your life. And this is a very sinister aspect that is very

83
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,680
unique to Islam. Would you like to expand on that a little, that

84
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,160
this whole cynicism about what you can't really offend 1.7

85
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,760
billion people, but that 1.7 billion large club, it's

86
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,600
large club, includes millions of people who are more than

87
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,040
willing to leave, but they are not willing to risk their lives

88
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,400
or just give up all their family lives and everything, their

89
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,440
identity, basically.

90
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,600
That's exactly it. And so when he was stopping the criticism

91
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,040
of Islam, basically what he was doing is he was condemning

92
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:42,360
those people to stay under this ideologies tyranny. So he

93
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,880
should have been supporting freedom of thought. This is a

94
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,200
man who made a movie called Dogma where he's criticizing

95
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,280
the religion of Christianity. So he's very familiar with how

96
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,960
Dogma can be imposed on people against their will. And if

97
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,400
only he knew how many Muslim people across the Muslim

98
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,000
majority world would love to have their freedom of thought

99
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,440
and their freedom of conscience and just their freedom to live

100
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,600
for goodness sake. I mean, in their laws, they have Sharia,

101
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:26,760
which is based on Islam, which is 1400 year old ideology. So it

102
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,640
is suppressing the progress of these countries. The people

103
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,920
themselves are like, you know, people look at the government

104
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,200
and they assume that that's the people. People look at the

105
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,640
fundamentalist ideology of Islam and they assume that that's

106
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:50,200
the people but that's not true. Muslim people want to be free

107
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,080
just like Christian people want to be free and Jewish people

108
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,320
want to be free and Hindu people want to be free and

109
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,520
atheist people want to be free. Everybody just wants to be

110
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,480
free. And when, you know, when Ben was doing that, basically

111
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:10,280
what he was doing was literally, I'm gonna let you guys

112
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,200
we supposed to start a little earlier today. But you know,

113
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,320
that's the thing later in the day, we get a more energetic

114
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,280
dogs get until they fall asleep. But I was going to say that he

115
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:31,080
was literally proving the subtitle of my book, which is

116
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,880
western how western liberals empower radical Islam. He was

117
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,800
protecting radical Islam. He was protecting fundamentalist

118
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,600
Islam by stopping these men from speaking about liberalism

119
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,680
and all of the liberal Muslims and all of the reform Muslims

120
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,200
and all of the free thinking Muslims that are stuck under

121
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,440
that ideology that would have been very excited like I was at

122
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,240
the time, very excited and very happy to see this conversation

123
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,240
happening on mainstream media that these two men actually

124
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,240
cared about our plight and what was going on in our communities.

125
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,240
Yeah, absolutely. My biggest culture shock because I arrived

126
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,040
in Canada in 2006 as a refugee. I was human traffic through

127
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,840
five countries, you know, left Iran with a fabricated

128
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,040
password and my crime was that I was a heavy metal guitar

129
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,840
player who, you know, I got even permitted by something

130
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,840
in Iran called Ministry of Guidance and Islamic Culture

131
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,640
that you have to go and get permission if you want to do

132
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,640
anything cultural related, so music, books, movies, anything.

133
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,040
And I didn't get permission after the second time. So I

134
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,840
just continue doing it underground and then I was deemed

135
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,640
as corrupting the revolutionary youth. I will never forget

136
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,840
that charge. I'm corrupting the revolutionary youth by being

137
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,440
a heavy metal guitar player, then got a court summon, our

138
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,640
house got raided. It was just insane. So when I made it to

139
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,840
Canada, I always say that my biggest culture shock was how

140
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,840
people were treating Islam because in Iran, in my

141
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,040
environment, everybody were not only done with the theocracy,

142
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,840
they were done with Islam. They're done with the religion.

143
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,840
Like we don't want to have anything to do with it. Like

144
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,440
Persians have their own thing and all of that, but the way

145
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:26,040
that the Westerners, these white liberal privileged people

146
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,040
are like, no, you don't know what you're talking about.

147
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,040
You had the wrong experience. What is it about? Because

148
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,640
this is not the first time that Islamists and leftists are

149
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,440
coming together. We had the same thing before the Iranian

150
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,640
revolution. Iraq is experiencing the similar thing.

151
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,040
What is it about Islam and far left and leftism that they

152
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,840
come together, they make alliances against the West,

153
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,040
against capitalism, against America, and once they succeed,

154
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,640
they start eating each other and usually Islamists are the

155
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,240
more successful part of that because they're more willing

156
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,640
to kill. You know, their permission is coming from Allah.

157
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,840
It's not from the man.

158
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:10,840
Yeah, yeah, a much stronger ideology, a much more

159
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,840
established ideology. So yeah, and like you said, they're

160
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,880
the ones that are willing to kill as well. Yeah, you're

161
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:23,240
right. That is incredibly terrifying to know that that

162
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:29,800
kind of alliance has a history of repeating itself and you

163
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,440
can sort of see the writing on the wall here in the Western

164
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:41,400
world now, but I think, you know, I hope that enough of us

165
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:49,640
will make enough noise that it won't get as far over here, but

166
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,520
it's really important for us to not be complacent and to not

167
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,840
be apathetic and to not just trust that Western values are

168
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,440
going to prevail. You know, if we don't support our own

169
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:06,120
values, our values are fragile and new really in comparison

170
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,600
to Islamic values and we're not willing to kill people. You

171
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:16,920
know, it's not authoritarian, so it is very important, I think,

172
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:22,520
that we fail our in being proud of what we have accomplished

173
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,560
in being proud of Western values and progressive values

174
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,720
and things like feminism and LGBT quality and all of these

175
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,280
things that we've achieved. We have to celebrate ourselves

176
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:39,960
more and appreciate these things more as opposed to

177
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:44,040
constantly self-flagellating. So, you know, in the US, they're

178
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,400
very like in the First Amendment, it talks about free

179
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,320
speech. We know how important free speech is, but you can see

180
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,640
it being challenged all over the United States of America.

181
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,880
It's incredibly terrifying like people don't realize how

182
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,520
important these values are and how important it is for us to

183
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:10,040
defend them like really loudly. Instead, we're we're almost

184
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,560
like ashamed of our values. Yeah, and it just seems like

185
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,760
the double standard that is being practiced by a lot of

186
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,520
people on the left who, you know, they could be well

187
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,000
meaning, but you know what they say that the road to hell is

188
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,920
paved by good will, good meaning because when you look at a

189
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,440
country like Iran where people and this goes back to the title

190
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,960
of your book, Unveiled, which I want you to expand on that.

191
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,640
What was the experience of unveiling for you because

192
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,480
people don't realize it that someone like Ilhan Omar, I

193
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,840
actually commented under one of your posts on Twitter.

194
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,120
Absolutely recommend everybody to follow you on Twitter

195
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,920
because, you know, there's so much to learn right from the

196
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,880
source. Ilhan Omar, her initial claim to fame is being the

197
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,840
first congress person to wear a hijab, but there is no limit in

198
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,760
Congress of United States to wear a hijab. At the same time,

199
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,720
all of these feminists that goodness forbid you say

200
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,280
something negative about Ilhan Omar attack you as an

201
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,720
Islamophobe and a whatever, they are all silent about people

202
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,600
in Iran, women in Iran who are risking their lives just to

203
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,640
take their veil off and send the video to someone like

204
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,760
Masih Ali Najat and then they're attacking someone like

205
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,040
Masih Ali Najat. Oh, this is the instrument of Mike Pompeo

206
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,520
Trump. What is happening with this double standard that it

207
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,160
just so obvious, you know, ignorance is definitely not an

208
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,840
excuse in the age of social media and information and

209
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:49,400
explain to the audience if you will this weight of being veiled

210
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:54,360
as the matter of involuntary necessity for a lot of women

211
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,040
and a lot of girls who are coming from that culture. I

212
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,560
think that if they were honest with themselves, they would

213
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,840
immediately recognize and understand how, you know, like

214
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,640
the way you called it, the weight of the veil, how it's

215
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,880
literally like shackles being put on a person. I mean,

216
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,240
they're over here talking about free the nipple. They want to

217
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,040
have their freedom to wear whatever they want. They

218
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,720
understand the importance of personal autonomy. This isn't

219
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,080
like something that they don't understand, but what's

220
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,880
disgusting is how they don't value women on the other side

221
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,160
of the world as much as they value themselves and they think

222
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:42,200
that those women somehow, you know, find empowerment in

223
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,480
taking their personal autonomy away. You know, for them,

224
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,680
hijab is good, but not for me. No, no, no. For me, I get to

225
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,280
wear whatever I want, but for them, I will celebrate them

226
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,840
when they wear hijab and I will put it on the cover of

227
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,040
magazines and I'll be so proud of Ilhan Omar that she puts a

228
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,040
scarf on her head as if she has done something. Like you said,

229
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,640
you know, there are no restrictions against women in

230
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:13,240
America wearing hijab. It's not some act of bravery, but if

231
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,760
you really want to see acts of bravery, then you should look

232
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,080
to the women in Iran who when they remove their hijab, they

233
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,400
are thrown in prison for 10 years or more. That's where the

234
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,280
bravery is. Those are the people that we should be

235
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,360
supporting. If you're truly a feminist and you truly care

236
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,760
about women, then it's very easy to see which women need

237
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,960
your support and which women you should be standing behind,

238
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:45,320
but at best, those women are ignored and at worst, people

239
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,880
speak out against them like the way they're speaking out

240
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,800
against Massey now and they're calling her a mouthpiece for

241
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:57,000
Trump. Massey has been fighting this fight from before Trump

242
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,640
ever even entered politics when he was still doing reality TV.

243
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,080
It's such an insult to this woman who has devoted her

244
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,560
entire life to this cause to now call her a mouthpiece for

245
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,640
Trump. They don't care. It doesn't matter. They don't care

246
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,360
about the actual individuals. They don't care what they're

247
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,920
doing to Massey. They don't care that her brother has been

248
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,520
imprisoned by the Islamic regime because they can't

249
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,360
reach her. They don't care about the the more danger that

250
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,560
they're putting her and her family in. It doesn't matter to

251
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,320
them. They just wanna push their own agenda. So, it's the

252
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,240
same thing with the Iranian protesters right now that are

253
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,120
I mean, I can't even fathom the kind of bravery it takes for

254
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,600
you to go into the streets when you know that over a thousand

255
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,440
people have been killed on those same streets for protesting

256
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,120
in the exact same way that you are protesting today and

257
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,160
somehow they have this super human bravery to stand out

258
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:04,840
there and protest against this regime and what when that

259
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,680
happens the media that should be supporting them that should

260
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,360
be standing behind them. This should be for freedom and for

261
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,160
democracy and for liberty. They don't want to talk about it.

262
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,280
They don't wanna support them because they're afraid that

263
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,720
that might end up look like like it's supporting Trump. Who

264
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,960
cares about Trump? It is irrelevant. It doesn't matter.

265
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,640
You know, Trump only got involved in this whole thing

266
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,120
because Americans were involved in this whole thing,

267
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,800
right? That's the only time we saw American involvement,

268
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,600
right? He's the president of the United States. His job is

269
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,600
to take care of American citizens. Iranians don't, it

270
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,320
doesn't matter. It doesn't matter to Massey and it doesn't

271
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,640
matter to the protesters. It's just this narcissism that they

272
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,720
only see the world through what matters to them and their own

273
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,600
perspective and their own Trump derangement syndrome. It's so

274
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:07,480
on, you know, it's so against liberal values for you to be

275
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,440
choosing to stay quiet and to not support these people

276
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,120
fighting for freedom because you're too afraid that that

277
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,840
might make it look like, you know, you're wearing the wrong

278
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:25,080
color of the jersey that's supporting your political team.

279
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,160
Yeah, they're the very same people, the people who are

280
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,640
attacking Massey and saying that you're a mouthpiece of

281
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,880
Trump. They're the very same people who went along when

282
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,120
Clinton said that Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian agent. Yes. And

283
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,400
the perspective comes from, I keep bringing up the quote by

284
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,440
AOC when she said that it's more important to be morally

285
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,560
right than factually correct because that is such a obvious

286
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:52,840
direction that hey, morality as we define it, you have to

287
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,360
submit to it and it doesn't matter what facts is, which is

288
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,440
very similar to religion. That's Islam. I read that and I

289
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,800
was like, she's a fucking mullah. Well, they are

290
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,000
starting or they have started their own version of

291
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,120
fundamentalist religion. I had Peter Boghossian, we talked

292
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,240
about this as well and he agrees that it's a religion.

293
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,320
It's a secular religion. This does not make any sense if you

294
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,920
look at it from a political philosophy perspective. Make

295
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,520
all the sense if you look at it from the religious kind of a

296
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,000
perspective. Before getting into analyzing that though, I

297
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,760
want to hear your experience of being unveiled because I think

298
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,880
I saw one photo of you younger when you were wearing hijab,

299
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,200
but I assume that you've been you've been wearing hijab for

300
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,160
much longer than a couple of years. Yeah. Oh, yeah. So it

301
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:47,800
was put on me at nine years old and I wore hijab for about 20

302
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:53,800
years and then I wore or no less than 20 years. I wore it

303
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:59,320
until I was about 20 and then I wore niqab after that. So

304
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,360
that's the covering of the whole face, even my eyes.

305
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,240
Actually, even my eyes were covered because of the man that

306
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,760
I was married to was

307
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,280
even the eyes needed to be covered. Every inch of skin

308
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,920
needed to be covered according to him. So I looked through a

309
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:28,280
thin black veil. Basically, that's how I saw the world. So

310
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:33,800
other than the fact that it's the physical representation

311
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:40,680
of just the subjugation and the dehumanization, the gender

312
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:46,760
apartheid, it is all of those things. It is just the

313
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:52,680
symbol. It's the tool actually. So it's like if you see a

314
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:58,520
slave and they have shackles on them, you know that the

315
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,720
shackles are just the visual representation of the fact that

316
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:07,960
this person is a slave. It's if you remove those shackles,

317
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:14,360
it's the first step for that person to start to find their

318
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,480
own personal freedom and their own personal autonomy. So

319
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,240
really that's what the hijab is. It confines a person in the

320
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,440
same way that shackles can find a slave. It restricts you. I

321
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,840
mean, I talk about the niqab as a personal, it was like a

322
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:36,040
sensory deprivation chamber, a portable sensory deprivation

323
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:43,720
chamber where it it reduced my ability to hear, to see, to

324
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:49,240
speak, to touch, to you know, every every one of my senses,

325
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:54,680
every one of my everything that makes me human and my ability

326
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,840
to interact and communicate with other humans. All of that

327
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:05,640
was taken away from me. I didn't even feel like I was part

328
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,440
of humanity. I felt like I was a ghost walking amongst people.

329
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,920
You know, I could see them, but they couldn't see me. I wasn't

330
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:20,600
part of the world and it's really difficult to explain

331
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:25,880
what that does to somebody, but essentially, I was rotting

332
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:31,000
under that cloth. I my my body and soul were rotting under

333
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,280
there and the reason why I fight against the hijab so much

334
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,320
is because not only in my experience, but in so many

335
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:48,280
women's experiences, I say that you know, you once you free

336
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,840
your head, you can free your mind. It's really just the

337
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:58,040
first step. Just just breaking off the shackles of the hijab

338
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:03,240
and then a woman is allowed to start thinking and to start

339
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,600
feeling and to start being and to start just feeling like a

340
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,280
human being. You know, you you can't even do that when you're

341
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:17,960
still shackled to this garb that forces you to just become

342
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:23,080
the image of a Muslim woman. You know, you don't have any

343
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,760
personal autonomy. You don't have any individuality. You are

344
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:32,520
just Muslim woman. That's it. That's how the world sees you.

345
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:40,440
That's how you see yourself and you know, you just to me, it

346
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,800
was like, you know, I'm trying to explain to my friends what

347
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,320
it feels like and it's like, okay, imagine if you're an emo

348
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,520
and you just want to wear black eyeliner and a black cloak,

349
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,320
but you're forced to wear a pink tutu and have frills in

350
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,800
your hair and stuff like it's it's everybody who looks at

351
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,840
you is going to think, oh, look at this little ballerina and

352
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,440
you're like, I'm not a fucking ballerina. Stop judging me, but

353
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,640
you just you're you're giving that impression out to the

354
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:16,120
whole world and it's so against who you are on the inside and

355
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:24,120
it's it's just the most. It's just the most effective way of

356
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:29,560
constricting and constraining both your body and your mind.

357
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,280
Yeah, and the moment you take it off, you know, the closest

358
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,040
people to you start calling you, I don't know, prostitute and

359
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:43,000
whore and so the idea is very clear to make women into sexual

360
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,800
objects because that's that's the worth of woman from the

361
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:51,160
perspective of I would say religiously enabled societies

362
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,000
because the kind of hijab differs from the culture to

363
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
culture, right? Like Afghanistan have their own

364
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,680
thing. Indonesia have their own thing. Some Muslim women in

365
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,200
Lebanon and Turkey, they're not even wearing anything and so

366
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,400
because of what it represents, the argument of me and a lot of

367
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:15,240
people like me is that if Mirab or Burka is allowed to be worn

368
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:21,000
in public places, so should be KKK hoods and Nazi paraphernalia

369
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,200
because you know it represents as you said, it's not just this

370
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,000
thing that people put on their head. It's being placed on

371
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
their head to represent something, but we seem to be as

372
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,040
you said very very far from really practicing and

373
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,160
appreciating the First Amendment of the United States.

374
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,640
The hypocrisy is just unbelievable. I mean people are

375
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:46,200
lining up in Washington DC to wear US flag as the hijab not

376
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:52,200
really realizing what what it symbolizes. That I'm not even

377
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,000
American and that makes me want to throw up. Yeah, I get so

378
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,240
upset disgusted overseeing that you you're taking a symbol of

379
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:08,360
freedom of liberty. People have you know how many lives have

380
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,000
been lost over fighting for this freedom and you're taking

381
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,960
that symbol and you're just you're you're defacing it by

382
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:25,560
forcing it into the most polar opposite of freedom. You know

383
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,840
it's the most disgusting possible thing that they could

384
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:33,080
have done with the American flag. Absolutely. Well, I mean

385
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,120
people behind it like Linda Sarsour and all those people

386
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,360
there. It's clear where they're coming from. It's just a lack

387
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:43,000
of education whether intentionally or

388
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,920
unintentionally of a lot of people in the left who seem to

389
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,880
have welcomed a lot of people like Linda Sarsour to energize

390
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,280
their base and again, you know it has precedent that you lose

391
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:58,040
control and as you said, Islamists are coming from far

392
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:02,200
more firm and solid ideologically speaking place

393
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,880
than the leftists. So, it's an unwitting kind of a battle and

394
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,880
unwitting kind of a war which begs the question. What do you

395
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,600
think is going to happen with the future of Islam and Muslims

396
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,440
in the western world because people are waking up in the

397
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,360
west and they're not buying into a lot of bullshit that has

398
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,600
been coming to them from relatively speaking limited

399
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,160
channels of interpretation and distribution of information.

400
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,880
That's really well said. So, those limited channels were

401
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,280
basically like the Muslim Brotherhood, right? They had the

402
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,720
money. They had the ability. They were able to create people

403
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:45,080
like Linda Sarsour who was able to gain prominence because

404
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,560
the Obama administration gave her some White House champions

405
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,480
of change award. Do you know what I mean? So, they were able

406
00:28:53,480 --> 00:29:00,200
to control the narrative for so long and now there are voices

407
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,920
like yours and mine that cannot be held back anymore because

408
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,680
we're on Twitter. We're on YouTube. We're on social media.

409
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:14,520
We don't have to be on MSNBC. We don't need to be you know to

410
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:19,160
get a call from BBC or CNN. We can get our voices out there in

411
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:25,160
different ways. So, they no longer have a monopoly on that

412
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:30,440
narrative anymore. So, we can come out and we can start to

413
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,400
give a counter narrative to what they've been hearing this

414
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,360
whole time. So, they've been hearing things like you know,

415
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,360
Islam is a religion of peace. That's a very hard thing to

416
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:46,440
sell when you guys you know like how do you sell Islam is a

417
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,320
religion of peace when you're going around stabbing people on

418
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,000
every bridge in London or your trucks of peace are are running

419
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,800
over people or you're killing each other in Iraq and in Syria

420
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:02,840
like or the Yazidis being taken as sex slaves and all that with

421
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:07,320
the the the truth coming out in the media, it's making people

422
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,520
start to question this narrative that they've been fed

423
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:14,760
and that they've swallowed for so long and when they start to

424
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,160
question and they start to look for answers, that's when they

425
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,440
find people like us and so that's why I think that what

426
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,400
we're doing is really valuable in changing that narrative and

427
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:32,840
in shifting that Islamist perspective to more of an honest

428
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,040
perspective of what it's like in the Muslim world. So, people

429
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,240
like Linda Sarsour are is you know, she's the kind of person

430
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,320
who would sell the garbage of the hijab means empowerment and

431
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,360
the hijab means feminism, right? And so, now, you're

432
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,880
going to have we have no hijab day and we have free from hijab

433
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,840
and you have women in Iran that are risking their lives and

434
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,600
putting the hijab on a stick and going to prison and all of

435
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,360
that stuff is countering the garbage that they have been

436
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:07,880
feeding people for so long and so, I think that at the end of

437
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:14,920
the day, just rational minded people and truth will prevail.

438
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,760
Yeah, the big picture ideal seems to be for Islam, the

439
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,720
doctrine of Islam to be reformed but we know that Islam

440
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:26,440
is also unique in that respect that it is said that it is the

441
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:32,280
final world of word of god and it cannot be reformed and it's

442
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,480
it's very sinister and very genius in that respect that

443
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,000
they put it that they this is it. It's not like no other

444
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,800
religion came after Islam, you know, it's just that anybody

445
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,680
that they could, they killed for this religion to have

446
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:49,080
monopoly on this. So, the question would be because Islam

447
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,520
cannot be reformed in a fundamental kind of a way and

448
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:56,200
because there is an awakening especially within the Muslim

449
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,800
communities, you know, it's not only Iran. I was reading that

450
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,320
Arabic translation of the God Delusion by Richard Dawkins,

451
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,080
what 10,000 times downloaded or a million times downloaded in

452
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:13,240
Saudi Arabia or something like that. So, you know, because

453
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,760
truth is is uncompromising, you know, when you hear it, it

454
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,480
resonates with you. You can struggle with it. You don't have

455
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,120
to sell it. You're not selling the truth. It's just the

456
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,040
truth. It's easy. It's it's it's the truth. So, what's going

457
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,880
to happen with this? I ask Salman this question to you that

458
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,640
the dynamic between Westerners and Muslims, what is going to

459
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,880
happen moving forward because it's not that people are going

460
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,480
to respect, hey, are we going to call you an Islamophobe? So,

461
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,960
you're going to shut the **** up because people have seen

462
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,000
people like me and you being called Islamophobe and racist

463
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,320
and then we talk about it like what the hell are you talking

464
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:54,280
about Islam? What does that even mean Islamophobe? So, what

465
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,120
do you see is going to happen between the dynamic between

466
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,680
Islam and the Western culture because there are a lot of

467
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:04,760
Muslims in the West, some believers, many not believers

468
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:10,360
and Islamists are taking advantage of this imbalance

469
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,240
between really knowing about what Islam is and between the

470
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,400
ideals the leftists have created for the Western

471
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:21,400
civilization. Well, I mean, I may be an eternal optimist but

472
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,560
I actually see Islamists losing their foothold. It may be

473
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:30,440
top down but we are greater in number and Islam may not ever

474
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,800
be reformed. I agree with you but I think Muslims will choose

475
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,960
to cherry pick their religion and they will choose to follow

476
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:45,240
only the parts of the religion that match their values. So,

477
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:50,040
they they will start to ignore all of the sexist verses and

478
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,960
all of the racist verses or all of the just scientifically

479
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,360
stupid verses like, you know, the the the earth is as flat as

480
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,400
a carpet and all of those things. They're gonna ignore

481
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,720
all that stuff. Sure, there's people in Saudi Arabia today

482
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,800
drinking camel urine but generally, Muslims ignore those

483
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,000
kinds of verses like we're already ignoring a lot of the

484
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,480
stupid things in the religion. So, we're just gonna continue

485
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,960
doing that. I think and you can see it, you know, some mosques

486
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,040
are starting up where they're LGBT safe. Some women are

487
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,480
saying, I wanna be an imam and I wanna read the Quran. You

488
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,040
know what I mean? Like, they're pushing the envelope in all

489
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,160
sorts of different ways and I fully and completely support

490
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,920
them but you know, unfortunately, you can only see

491
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,880
those kinds of things happening in the western world where

492
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:46,120
people have the freedom to to do these things. Still, under

493
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:51,240
dictatorships, under Sharia countries, you don't see those

494
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:55,560
changes happening quite as much. Well, quite as publicly

495
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:01,320
because there's so much more danger in doing that. So, I

496
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:05,480
think what the western world needs to do is to support

497
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,560
people that are trying to separate mosque and state. So,

498
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:14,120
our biggest responsibility now in the west is to support the

499
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,240
Iranian protest protesters who are trying to bring down the

500
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:22,760
Islamic regime. That is where we should be. 100% behind them

501
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,560
and behind people in Sudan who want democracy and behind

502
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,000
people in Egypt who want democracy and behind people in

503
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,280
Iraq who want democracy. In the past, unfortunately, you know,

504
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:41,000
not only in Iran but in in Egypt as well, the west has

505
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,640
always supported the fundamentalist Muslim

506
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:48,920
governments to come in and we need to stop doing that. We

507
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,520
need to start supporting democratic governments. We

508
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,720
need to start supporting the people when they want their

509
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:01,800
freedom and I think that's hopefully that's the shift. I

510
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:08,200
think what's happening in Iran right now is so incredibly I

511
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:14,840
mean, it's both really sad and heartbreaking and angering but

512
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:20,840
at the same time, it's just awe inspiring and it really as

513
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,080
they say, you know, sometimes things have to get worse before

514
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,160
they can get better. I've always said, you know,

515
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,000
especially about Iranian women that they're just superhuman

516
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,320
like it's phenomenal. I don't even know where they're like

517
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:40,920
Amazonian. I can't even I can't fathom their bravery, you

518
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:50,120
know, and so I feel like they are going to be the ones to

519
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:55,800
start this trend and to start, you know, if you can if you can

520
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,600
topple the Islamic regime in Iran, anything after that is

521
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:05,640
easy. So, if they can do it and people around the Islamic world

522
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,160
see them do it, they're going to feel like our job is going to

523
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:13,240
be so much easier if they did it, we can do it too and I

524
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:17,000
think that's kind of what happened with me and people like

525
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,040
Salman Rushdie and Ayaan Hirsi Ali and a lot of other ex

526
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:24,280
Muslims is we saw like if Salman Rushdie can do it or if

527
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,200
Ayaan Hirsi Ali can do it, then I can do it too. Of course, I

528
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:33,640
didn't have somebody, you know, stab a death threat into

529
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,000
another person's body, a death threat against me. You know

530
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,360
what I mean? Like it and she still is out there and she's

531
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:44,360
still writing books and she's still speaking. So, it gives

532
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:49,640
you hope in human resilience and human spirit and you feel

533
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:53,480
like, you know, like they say, you can't be what you cannot

534
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:58,360
see. So, I think that we're all going to look to Iran as that

535
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:06,680
example and I hope that it will continue to topple the Islamic

536
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,240
governments and it will continue this trend of

537
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,840
separation of mosque and state and then just once the people

538
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:17,160
are free, I mean, the world just is just going to it's such a

539
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,640
it's going to be such a gift, the art and music and talent

540
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:27,240
and just all of the the the the intellect and the amazing minds

541
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:31,160
that have been suppressed and not part of the world. It's all

542
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,880
going to come out and it's it's going to be, you know, I hope I

543
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,080
live to see it. Yeah, same here and it really comes down to

544
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,960
free flow of information, right? Even here, you see

545
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,720
someone like Kamala Harris suggests that Twitter shut down

546
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,680
Donald Trump's account. Well, why is she saying that? She's

547
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,480
saying that to shut down an argument that disagrees with

548
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,360
her and if they can't remove president of the United States,

549
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,320
they can't remove anyone else who disagrees with them and

550
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:59,800
this way of thinking has been unfortunately institutionalized

551
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,960
in Iran for the past over 40 years. Not that Shah was all,

552
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,200
you know, bright and everything because anything that happens

553
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,560
is a consequence of the process that's, you know, that's

554
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,440
been going on for far longer. Yasmeen's book is called

555
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:16,600
Unveiled How Western Liberals Empower Radical Islam. We talked

556
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,320
a lot about the US but we haven't talked about Canada.

557
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,680
You live in Canada. I lived in Canada for 11 years. I cannot

558
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:28,920
stand liberals and Trudeau. I spent maybe about a year

559
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,440
campaigning against liberals and Trudeau and try to explain

560
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,200
in any shape or form I could that this is not about racism.

561
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,200
This is not about the we don't like diversity and all of that.

562
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,960
This is about these people are destroying a country for the

563
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,040
sake of legitimacy that they do not have. So, how do you see it

564
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:52,200
with respect to liberals and Trudeau? Oh, I 100% agree with

565
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,720
you. I've also spoke. I speak out against Trudeau all the

566
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:00,200
time. It's so much now that I'm actually like I'm just sick of

567
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:05,080
him. Yes, I can't even hear his voice. I can't see his face. I

568
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,040
don't even want to talk about him anymore because I'm so

569
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:12,200
disheartened that he became the prime minister again. Like I

570
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:17,880
used to speak out against him a lot more before but now

571
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,200
it's almost like I'm in this state of denial. Like I don't

572
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,560
even want to believe that that he's still our prime minister.

573
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:29,160
It's it's everything that you said but it's also ironic that

574
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,680
these same people that are afraid that we are the ones us

575
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,440
with our brown skin from our Middle Eastern background that

576
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:41,480
we are the ones that you have to fear that we might be racist

577
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,400
and that we might be bigoted against Muslims. Meanwhile,

578
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,840
this **** is the one that's been in blackface three times.

579
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:52,600
You know what I mean? Like he's the one who you should be

580
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,600
worried about racism from. The fact of the matter is people

581
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:02,680
like Justin Trudeau do not care about human beings. They only

582
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:10,200
care about votes. So, if he's gonna support secular Muslims

583
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,440
or ex-Muslims, that's a very small group but if he's gonna

584
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,640
support fundamentalist or conservative Muslims, that's a

585
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,760
much larger voting block and that's all it comes down to

586
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,200
for him. He could give less of a **** about feminism. He's

587
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,360
pretending to be a feminist. He is how is he a feminist yet at

588
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,840
the same time, he's selling arms to Saudi Arabia. What do

589
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:36,040
you think Saudi Arabia is gonna do with those people? Yeah,

590
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,400
look how they're killing everybody in Yemen and and then

591
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:43,560
that he takes selfies with the refugees that he has created,

592
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:48,200
right? It's just on the campaign trail. He is as fake and as

593
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,680
shallow and as just like the quintessential disgusting

594
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,720
politician. I have absolutely nothing positive to say about

595
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:01,080
him. In the past, I used to think that he was just dumb but

596
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,400
you know, it's kind of like what you said at the beginning

597
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:07,320
of this this interview when you talked about the road to hell

598
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:13,800
is paved with good intentions. That ignorance, the fact that

599
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:19,320
he's so dumb is so dangerous when he is the leader of a

600
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,440
country. So, I can't even just dismiss him as an idiot

601
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:27,320
anymore because he is an incredibly dangerous idiot and

602
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,360
you know, just the way he's been reacting now with the

603
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:35,160
protesters in Iran that just solidifies, you know, my

604
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:39,720
disgust for him. It it his response was of no surprise to

605
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:44,040
me and I'm just ashamed. I'm ashamed that that he is the

606
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,960
leader. I'm ashamed that he became the leader again and to

607
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,000
be perfectly honest, I think it has a lot to do with the fact

608
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,680
that our conservative government just did not offer

609
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:01,400
the right counterweight to Trudeau. So, in the same way

610
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,160
where, you know, people in the US were saying about Hillary,

611
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,200
they're like, how horrible of a person does she have to be to

612
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:12,040
lose to Trump? It's the same thing about Trudeau. Like how

613
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:15,320
bad did Scheer have to be to lose to Trudeau? Nobody liked

614
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:20,920
him. Yep. But you know, in Canada, we have everybody is

615
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,360
left. We have left more left and even more left. Those are

616
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:28,520
our parties, you know, and so even our conservatives are

617
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,320
left. Our conservative party is more left than Bernie Sanders

618
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:37,480
for goodness sake. So, we're already far off the scale but

619
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,600
what happened with our conservative government is that

620
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:47,160
they did not stand up strong for Western and liberal values.

621
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,040
They didn't do that. Unfortunately, the conservative

622
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,800
governments before them did do that. So, under Stephen Harper,

623
00:43:53,800 --> 00:44:00,360
he had he was very clear. He had a hotline where he created

624
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,720
the hotline for people to speak out and to call, you know, if

625
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:07,400
you're being forced into a marriage, FGM, he called it like

626
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,840
barbaric acts, you know, things like that. You call this hotline,

627
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:15,800
you ask for help, you get support for the women under

628
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,560
these regimes, you know, not just Islamic but whether it's

629
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:25,320
Sikh or Hindu or whatever else. If you feel like you're being

630
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,680
forced into a situation that you don't wanna be in, here is

631
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,320
an anonymous hotline that you can make this phone call and

632
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:36,360
you can get some support. Trudeau came in and he removed

633
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:41,960
that hotline and when whereas Harper in the past would talk

634
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,880
about, you know, FGM wasn't allowed in candidates against

635
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,160
the law. It's a barbaric act. You have Trudeau coming in and

636
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:53,800
saying, oh, cutting a girl's genitals with a razor. We don't

637
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,320
wanna call that barbaric. That's that's a terrible word to

638
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,360
use. Well, if you don't call that barbaric, then what is

639
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:04,440
barbaric? What could possibly be more barbaric than that? And

640
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,400
who would call it barbaric if it's not the Prime Minister of

641
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:13,800
Canada? Yes, that's right. So, it's just like we should have,

642
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,720
we needed a stronger conservative government that

643
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,880
looked to the Canadian people and said, we will defend your

644
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:29,000
values. We will defend, you know, freedom of speech, LGBT

645
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,360
equality. That was a big thing because our conservative

646
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,560
leader wouldn't go to any pride parades and and he was

647
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:39,720
talking about abortion and stuff like that. Like these are

648
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,400
not conversations in Canada. They might be conversations in

649
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,280
the US. They are not conversations in Canada.

650
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:52,680
Everybody is way beyond. You know, we believe in LGBT

651
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:57,640
equality across the board and to have somebody running for

652
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:03,480
Prime Minister who was wishy washy on that topic. It was

653
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:07,720
detrimental to him. Yeah, not only they didn't stand up for

654
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:12,600
Western values, they jeopardize them because yes, Salim Mansoor

655
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:16,520
I think is a very good example how this is a Muslim

656
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:20,280
professor who has been talking against Islamic radicalism and

657
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:24,840
all that and he wanted to run as a conservative but he got

658
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,640
kicked out because they're like, oh, there's a threat of us

659
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,360
being called Islamophobic because of Salim Mansoor and he

660
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,000
joined People's Party of Canada, which I believe is a

661
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
populist party. I voted for them not because of any specific

662
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,320
kind of a person for the kind of principles that they're

663
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,800
talking about because no one else is talking about freedom

664
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,560
of speech and it's incredibly important when the other side

665
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,360
of the argument is saying we have to regulate social media.

666
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,360
I'm not saying that they're going to be successful doing

667
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:56,040
that, but it's the perspective that hey, it's a monopoly on

668
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,880
the narrative and that is being determined by the left. It

669
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,480
just it doesn't seem to be very sustainable and to the credit

670
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,600
of majority of Canadian people, I think it's important to say

671
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:11,560
that liberals won the smallest minority in history of Canada

672
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:15,320
with less than 33%, which shows what a messed up electoral

673
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,920
system Canada has that I was watching it live. You know,

674
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,800
they went through maybe three province, four provinces in the

675
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,840
east and oh, okay, this is the power dynamic. This is who's

676
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,480
in charge. So what about the west? No wonder they want to

677
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,560
split, you know, that always. Yeah, I live in the west coast

678
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,200
and yeah, that's that's always the way it is. You're in

679
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,480
Vancouver, right? Yeah. Oh, that's a beautiful place. I

680
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,760
lived in Vancouver for a year and a half. I went to Vancouver

681
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,280
film school studied sound design. Yeah, but it's been

682
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,920
like more than half of my school year experimenting with

683
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:50,360
psychedelics. Yeah, and we have a lot of that here too. Yeah,

684
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:54,600
that was very helpful for me though, because you know, I got

685
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,000
from the place of anything that has anything to do with

686
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,240
religion is awful to be able to look at churches and even mosque

687
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:07,080
and separate the architectural and artistic values from the

688
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:11,560
ideological aspect of it. This is very helpful to me and you

689
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,120
know, I think people in the Middle East, they need acid and

690
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:19,720
mushrooms more than yeah. Yeah, they need to be removed from

691
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:23,880
that for a while to get that fresh perspective because it's

692
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,840
easier for I mean, I went through the same thing you're

693
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,920
describing. I mean, I didn't have any psychedelics to help

694
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,840
me, but it went through the same process of just I I hated

695
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:36,600
the sound of the language Arabic. I didn't want to hear

696
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,320
it. I didn't want to see Arab people. I didn't want to eat

697
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,640
Arab food. I wouldn't even eat Greek food because it was

698
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:48,280
similar to Arabic food like I ended up lumping the whole Arab

699
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:51,480
culture in with Islam and just making it one in the same and

700
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:56,440
that was unfair. You know now over so much time, I've been

701
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:00,440
able to gain a perspective and appreciation for Arabic music

702
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:05,880
again and Arabic culture minus all of the religious stuff, but

703
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,160
yeah, it takes a long time. It's almost like it's triggering.

704
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,760
It's almost like PTSD. You know as soon as you see that stuff,

705
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,240
you're like no fuck it fuck all of it like you just don't

706
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:19,560
want any of it in your life, but I think that people in the

707
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:23,560
Middle East are so immersed in it. So their hate is a lot

708
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:28,360
more visceral right now, but if they can just be removed from

709
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:34,280
it for a while, then they can start to appreciate you know

710
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:37,720
the value that it can bring minus all of that garbage.

711
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:42,040
You're lucky in Iran that you have that you've sustained your

712
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:47,720
Persian culture right like my family is from Egypt. They call

713
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:51,240
themselves Arabs like it's called the Arab Republic of

714
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:54,280
Egypt. What the fuck does it have to do? It's in Africa.

715
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:59,080
It has nothing to do with Arabs. They lost the language,

716
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:03,080
the religion, the culture. The only thing we know about Egypt

717
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,960
is the stuff that the British people care about with the

718
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:10,440
ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and stuff like that. Egyptians

719
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,560
themselves don't care about any of that. They don't value

720
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:17,800
anything to do with their real culture. You know in Morocco,

721
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,360
you can see a little bit of the Berber stuff that has still

722
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:26,040
been upheld, but so many countries have lost their

723
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:32,280
pre-Islamic culture and it's you know I'm just saying Iran

724
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,440
like you guys are lucky that you have been able to to

725
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,480
sustain it somewhat so you have something else that's

726
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,280
beautiful about your country that has nothing to do with

727
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:46,760
Islam. Yeah and a lot of people you know have died trying to

728
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,960
preserve that culture and a lot of people. Iran is a very

729
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:54,040
very nationalist kind of a country. I sometimes have this

730
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:57,960
conversation with people here that even whatever you want to

731
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:01,880
call racism or nationalism in a negative aspect of it that is

732
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:06,440
very alive and well in Iran as a mainstream, but perhaps that

733
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,240
element is something that has preserved the Iranian culture

734
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,120
because this is funny actually when Trump was talking about

735
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:16,200
having 52 targets, including cultural targets in Iran. This

736
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:20,360
was brought up that one of Khomeini loyalists, Khal Khali,

737
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:24,760
he wanted to bowl those down person after the success of the

738
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,880
revolution and people lined up in front of it held hands so

739
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:32,040
they couldn't do it. So definitely nationalism and a

740
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,000
lot of these Islamists within the Islamic Republic regime

741
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,760
like Ahmadinejad people they are trying to take this Iranian

742
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:44,280
nationalism and mix it with Shiism to create something new

743
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,080
out of it because they understand that this version of

744
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:51,800
Shiism theocracy this is done like people not buying into it

745
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,520
at all, but we'll see what's going to happen. It's a sad

746
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:58,200
state of affair in Iran, but hey, as you said people need to

747
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,080
do what they need to do the way that they need to do it. I am

748
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:06,680
not in favor of any kind of a war or Western intervention

749
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:10,040
yet. I'm absolutely in favor of US coming out of the nuclear

750
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,360
deal. I mean, how are you going to deal with the Islamic

751
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:16,120
regime? They're liars. You know you cannot trust them, but in

752
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,480
unique time unique times to be alive and having our

753
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:25,560
perspective really. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yasmeen's book is called

754
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:29,160
Unveiled How Western Liberals Empower Radical Islam. What is

755
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:35,480
next for you and where can our audience follow your work? So

756
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:41,720
right now, I am going all across Canada, US, Australia,

757
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:46,680
Europe, some parts of Asia even promoting my book. So I'll be

758
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:50,840
if people go to my website yasmeenmuhammad.com and they

759
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:54,920
subscribe to my newsletter, then they can see where I'll be and

760
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,640
when and then hopefully they can come out and see me and

761
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:01,960
support and get a signed copy of my book and the other thing

762
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:05,240
that I'm working on is my organization Free Hearts Free

763
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:11,080
Minds, which is all about supporting people from the

764
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:15,320
living in the Muslim world who have left Islam and we're

765
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,720
always looking for donations so people are interested in going

766
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,280
to that website and taking a look at the testimonials and

767
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,960
seeing how we've helped people. That would be fantastic and

768
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:27,800
you can find me on Twitter where I'm usually pretty active

769
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:36,040
and yeah. Your Twitter handle is at yasmeenmuhammadxx. I've

770
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:41,080
put it under your name so our audience can see it. This was

771
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,480
awesome having you. Thank you so much for your time. Let me

772
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,680
ask you the last question that I ask all my guests that if you

773
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,560
come across an intelligent alien from a different

774
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:53,160
civilization, what would you say is the worst thing humanity

775
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,560
has done and what would you say is humanity's greatest

776
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:58,120
achievement?

777
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:05,320
The worst thing we have done is up for debate. I think we've

778
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:08,840
done a lot of horrible things, but I think that our best

779
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:13,240
achievement is that we continue to move forward that no matter

780
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:18,600
how bad things are, we generally are always moving

781
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:23,800
forward. We don't consistently move forward like sometimes we

782
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:29,320
take one step back, but I think in general, I have a lot of

783
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:36,920
faith in humanity and our resilience and I think that's

784
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:40,440
the best thing about us is that we're still willing to

785
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,480
persevere.

786
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:14,120
Thank you.
