00:00.000 --> 00:01.600
Why aren't they talking about AI?

00:01.600 --> 00:05.480
It just doesn't matter enough to the constituents, right?

00:05.480 --> 00:08.840
Why are they talking about, name your topic, sir.

00:08.840 --> 00:09.920
Name your topic.

00:09.920 --> 00:11.760
I mean, the most arbitrary things

00:11.760 --> 00:13.840
become giant friction points

00:13.840 --> 00:16.080
and then they get in all the speeches.

00:16.080 --> 00:18.080
Is it because of their inherent meaning

00:18.080 --> 00:20.040
and some platonic reality?

00:20.040 --> 00:21.240
No, no, no.

00:21.240 --> 00:23.480
It's simply because they resonate with the constituency.

00:23.480 --> 00:25.880
So we can expect AI to land

00:25.960 --> 00:30.720
on the sort of political speech table

00:30.720 --> 00:33.840
when it matters to the people who are being spoken to.

00:41.720 --> 00:45.160
Hello and welcome to the 80th episode of New Human Podcast.

00:45.160 --> 00:50.120
I'm a Gabbahari etiologist on Instagram and Twitter

00:50.120 --> 00:52.120
and you can follow the show on liveinlumbo.com,

00:52.120 --> 00:55.440
iTunes, YouTube, BitChute, and at some point on Spotify.

00:55.440 --> 00:58.120
And today with me, I have Daniel Affigiello.

00:58.120 --> 01:00.320
Welcome to New Human Podcast, Daniel.

01:00.320 --> 01:01.600
Hey, glad to be here, brother.

01:01.600 --> 01:03.920
Yeah, let's start with your background,

01:03.920 --> 01:05.600
the work you've done, the lives you've lived

01:05.600 --> 01:08.160
and what are you mainly focused on now these days?

01:08.160 --> 01:13.160
Yeah, so I began sort of not in the computer science space.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.960
So right now I'm the founder and head of research

01:15.960 --> 01:18.440
at a company called Emerge Artificial Intelligence Research

01:18.440 --> 01:20.280
that I founded some three years ago

01:20.280 --> 01:22.240
when I sold my last business.

01:22.240 --> 01:24.200
So at Emerge, our work is really

01:24.240 --> 01:27.760
mapping the return on investment of AI in the private sector.

01:27.760 --> 01:30.240
So we look at banking and financial services,

01:30.240 --> 01:31.920
we look at pharmaceutical,

01:31.920 --> 01:33.920
we look at the range of AI use cases

01:33.920 --> 01:36.160
and which of them are actually delivering value

01:36.160 --> 01:39.280
and we provide research products and data and advisory,

01:39.280 --> 01:41.120
kind of like a Forrester or a Gardner,

01:41.120 --> 01:44.120
to big companies who want to actually see a return

01:44.120 --> 01:45.200
from artificial intelligence.

01:45.200 --> 01:47.720
We do a good deal of work in the public sector as well,

01:47.720 --> 01:49.760
mostly in defense and security,

01:49.760 --> 01:52.160
financial crime, surveillance, things along those lines,

01:52.160 --> 01:54.080
but primarily in the private sector,

01:54.960 --> 01:56.720
it's going to be financial services, life sciences.

01:56.720 --> 01:59.000
So market research is the name of the game,

01:59.000 --> 02:00.840
but you want me to get into the old school stuff.

02:00.840 --> 02:03.240
Yeah, it's interesting to have context

02:03.240 --> 02:06.680
where the perspective of each individual comes from.

02:06.680 --> 02:09.240
I mean, I want to talk about Emerge,

02:09.240 --> 02:10.560
I want to talk about AI,

02:10.560 --> 02:13.560
but it's also interesting to know who is representing

02:13.560 --> 02:16.480
and expressing these ideas about AI.

02:16.480 --> 02:18.040
For sure.

02:18.040 --> 02:19.920
Well, I'll give you, I guess, a little bit of backdrop.

02:19.920 --> 02:23.160
So I'm not exactly from a tech background at all,

02:23.320 --> 02:25.560
I'm from a 4,000 person town in Rhode Island

02:25.560 --> 02:26.880
called Wakefield, Rhode Island.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.040
You've never heard of it before,

02:28.040 --> 02:29.760
and you will from this point until you're deaf,

02:29.760 --> 02:31.280
never hear of it again.

02:31.280 --> 02:33.400
It's a very small place.

02:33.400 --> 02:34.920
It's a quaint place, a beautiful place,

02:34.920 --> 02:36.720
but it's not a place I could stay,

02:36.720 --> 02:38.600
given my objectives in life.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.440
So that's where I'm from,

02:40.440 --> 02:42.680
and the way that I paid for college,

02:42.680 --> 02:44.600
and ultimately for Ivy League graduate school

02:44.600 --> 02:45.960
at the University of Pennsylvania,

02:45.960 --> 02:47.720
where I studied cognitive science,

02:47.720 --> 02:49.920
and my focus was on skill development

02:49.920 --> 02:51.120
and skill acquisition.

02:51.160 --> 02:53.920
So the cognitive science of acquiring skills quickly.

02:53.920 --> 02:55.040
The reason I went in for that

02:55.040 --> 02:56.560
is because I was in combat sports.

02:56.560 --> 02:57.680
So the way I was paying the bills

02:57.680 --> 02:58.880
was running a martial arts gym.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.360
So I was training fighters.

03:00.360 --> 03:02.120
We had some fitness classes,

03:02.120 --> 03:04.800
but it was mostly mixed martial arts and Brazilian jiu-jitsu.

03:04.800 --> 03:06.480
So I have a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu.

03:06.480 --> 03:08.400
I've trained extensively, given seminars

03:08.400 --> 03:11.040
around the United States and even in Brazil,

03:11.040 --> 03:12.920
and won a national tournament,

03:12.920 --> 03:14.880
and did a lot of competing in my day.

03:14.880 --> 03:16.640
And so that's how I was kind of paying the bills.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.960
And so I was really interested in what does it look like

03:18.960 --> 03:21.880
to improve faster from an athlete perspective,

03:21.880 --> 03:24.120
training my own fighters, training myself.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.880
And so that's what I went to graduate school for.

03:25.880 --> 03:28.720
And when I was there, this is back in 2011,

03:28.720 --> 03:30.200
I was getting capped on the shoulder that,

03:30.200 --> 03:32.640
hey, Dan, all this human learning stuff,

03:32.640 --> 03:34.200
all this neural stuff,

03:34.200 --> 03:36.080
they're kind of doing that with computers.

03:36.080 --> 03:38.080
And this is the really early days of ImageNet,

03:38.080 --> 03:40.240
when ImageNet started becoming exciting.

03:40.240 --> 03:41.680
This is also the very early days

03:41.680 --> 03:43.960
of when they were applying natural language processing

03:43.960 --> 03:44.800
to Twitter data.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.480
There was something called Google Zeitgeist

03:46.480 --> 03:48.960
that UPenn was involved with at the time,

03:48.960 --> 03:52.360
deriving sentiment from different factors

03:52.360 --> 03:54.160
in the social media ether,

03:54.160 --> 03:56.640
and kind of determining how that correlated

03:56.640 --> 03:57.640
to different cities,

03:57.640 --> 03:59.200
and how weather affected different cities,

03:59.200 --> 04:01.160
and the moods of people, and the sicknesses of people,

04:01.160 --> 04:02.160
and things along those lines.

04:02.160 --> 04:06.160
So when I got out of grad school with the psych degree,

04:06.160 --> 04:08.480
I kind of became convinced this AI stuff,

04:08.480 --> 04:09.480
looking at the near term,

04:09.480 --> 04:11.400
and then also reading people like Nick Bostrom

04:11.400 --> 04:14.080
and Ben Goertzel, and learning about the long term.

04:14.080 --> 04:16.080
I was lucky enough to interview Ben Goertzel

04:16.320 --> 04:18.160
and Bostrom pretty much right out of grad school.

04:18.160 --> 04:21.200
I talked to all the major players in the AGI space.

04:21.200 --> 04:22.200
I became very convinced

04:22.200 --> 04:23.560
that in both the near and the long term,

04:23.560 --> 04:25.920
this was an exceedingly important technology,

04:25.920 --> 04:28.200
and that my understanding from a conceptual level

04:28.200 --> 04:29.680
in the cognitive sciences,

04:29.680 --> 04:31.520
I should just be able to transfer that over.

04:31.520 --> 04:34.360
So I got right into really studying this stuff,

04:34.360 --> 04:36.240
and then talking to the leading figures there,

04:36.240 --> 04:38.440
and eventually started a company.

04:38.440 --> 04:39.280
Very cool.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.520
I mean, you must have started with interest in the mind,

04:41.520 --> 04:43.120
getting into martial art,

04:43.120 --> 04:45.520
the kind of martial art that you got into.

04:45.520 --> 04:48.320
It's not that, hey, let's just go out and kick some ass.

04:48.320 --> 04:50.680
It's more about finding yourself, right?

04:50.680 --> 04:53.600
Through that art of battle.

04:54.520 --> 04:56.200
Yeah, there's something to be said of that.

04:56.200 --> 04:58.840
I don't personally overly spiritualize martial arts.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.480
I think some people will play it up.

05:00.480 --> 05:02.040
They'll be like, oh yes, I'm a martial artist,

05:02.040 --> 05:04.080
and so you should presume that I am wise.

05:04.080 --> 05:05.040
I actually don't do that.

05:05.040 --> 05:06.040
I think if I am wise,

05:06.040 --> 05:07.960
it's because I've read Montaigne and Plutarch,

05:07.960 --> 05:10.800
more than because I've choked men unconscious.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.640
But I've done both,

05:12.640 --> 05:16.000
and I can say that certainly part of the fascination

05:16.000 --> 05:19.440
of the mind is from beginning with martial arts,

05:19.440 --> 05:21.360
and being able to see how different people learn,

05:21.360 --> 05:22.920
and also see how I learned, right?

05:22.920 --> 05:25.120
To go from, you know, in Rhode Island,

05:25.120 --> 05:26.480
there's not that many good training partners,

05:26.480 --> 05:29.720
so to win national tournaments is actually pretty difficult.

05:29.720 --> 05:32.920
And I had to figure out how to go about drilling,

05:32.920 --> 05:34.680
figure out what kind of training regimens

05:34.680 --> 05:35.520
to build for myself.

05:35.520 --> 05:37.400
And it wasn't just what kind of weights to lift.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.880
In fact, I wasn't doing much of that.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.960
It was what kind of skills do I want to acquire?

05:40.960 --> 05:43.200
And so that forced me to think about,

05:43.200 --> 05:45.160
well, how does this thing upstairs actually work?

05:45.160 --> 05:47.160
And how can I learn as quickly as possible

05:47.160 --> 05:49.960
to really perform and also have my competitors

05:49.960 --> 05:52.320
do very well in tournaments too?

05:52.320 --> 05:54.040
So yeah, it was less spiritual,

05:54.040 --> 05:56.400
but it certainly was psychological in martial arts,

05:56.400 --> 05:59.520
and that's what got me to UPenn and ultimately into AI.

05:59.520 --> 06:01.000
Yeah, in addition to spirituality,

06:01.000 --> 06:04.160
it's also that you had choked people unconscious,

06:04.160 --> 06:06.880
but I assume that you were also choked unconscious yourself.

06:06.880 --> 06:10.240
You were placed on the other side of the equation.

06:10.240 --> 06:11.680
Sure, sure did.

06:11.680 --> 06:13.160
I mean, everybody weighs more than me.

06:13.160 --> 06:14.200
I'm a pretty small fella,

06:14.200 --> 06:15.800
so I did a lot of competitions

06:15.800 --> 06:17.280
against very, very big opponents.

06:17.280 --> 06:18.440
In fact, if you go on Google,

06:18.440 --> 06:21.000
you type in Dan Fijella versus the Giant,

06:21.000 --> 06:23.320
you'll see me in a jujitsu match

06:23.320 --> 06:26.600
against a guy that weighs 80 pounds, 100 pounds more than me

06:26.600 --> 06:27.920
who's actually a UFC fighter.

06:27.920 --> 06:28.760
His name is Pat Walsh.

06:28.760 --> 06:31.640
So this guy fought in the cage with other 220 pound men.

06:31.640 --> 06:33.800
I walk around at about a buck 25.

06:33.800 --> 06:38.280
So definitely, I didn't beat all those guys.

06:38.280 --> 06:39.120
That was a good match.

06:39.120 --> 06:40.120
I'll fortunately beat that guy.

06:40.960 --> 06:44.920
But yeah, I certainly had my ears boxed pretty good.

06:44.920 --> 06:48.080
You can see my cauliflower ear is pretty rough.

06:48.080 --> 06:50.480
And I've certainly, you know,

06:50.480 --> 06:52.400
I'm gonna have knee problems when I'm older.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.240
That's just a fact.

06:53.240 --> 06:54.680
I'm gonna have shoulder problems when I'm older.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.040
That's just a fact.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.160
But right now, it doesn't keep me from doing market research

06:58.160 --> 06:59.520
and what I love, so, you know.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.640
Yeah, it just seems that that experience of humility

07:02.640 --> 07:04.560
and empathy that you create

07:04.560 --> 07:07.000
when you're on the other side of something like that

07:07.000 --> 07:09.280
is also helpful when you're working on,

07:09.320 --> 07:11.160
let's say, artificial intelligence,

07:11.160 --> 07:14.880
which is a big difference from what is being written down

07:14.880 --> 07:16.640
on paper and in academia

07:16.640 --> 07:19.600
than what it's being implemented within the society,

07:19.600 --> 07:22.040
especially the society right now today

07:22.040 --> 07:23.760
that a lot of people are freaked out

07:23.760 --> 07:26.360
by just the name artificial intelligence

07:26.360 --> 07:29.440
and in a lot of aspect for right reasons, right?

07:29.440 --> 07:31.960
So I'm trying to get into,

07:31.960 --> 07:34.240
and we've talked about this a lot in this podcast,

07:34.240 --> 07:36.240
that what you put on the paper,

07:36.240 --> 07:39.200
it might seem awesome and sounds great,

07:40.120 --> 07:42.840
but there's a big difference between what sounds good

07:42.840 --> 07:44.400
and sounds sensible on the paper

07:44.400 --> 07:47.200
than when it's being implemented within the society

07:47.200 --> 07:49.640
when a lot of people have a problem

07:49.640 --> 07:52.080
even accepting the existence of such a thing

07:52.080 --> 07:54.240
that is going to compete with human intelligence

07:54.240 --> 07:56.800
and human, basically the concept of humanity.

07:58.080 --> 08:00.360
Yeah, I think, you know, in the near term,

08:00.360 --> 08:02.480
there's the job and economic considerations

08:02.480 --> 08:04.760
that are real.

08:04.760 --> 08:06.960
I don't think we're gonna see the wave of automation

08:07.000 --> 08:09.280
across the country in the very, very near term,

08:09.280 --> 08:11.480
but I do foresee in the next 10 years,

08:11.480 --> 08:15.680
we did a very substantial poll in 2015 of AI researchers

08:15.680 --> 08:17.960
and by a wide margin,

08:17.960 --> 08:21.480
the most significant and consistent AI risk

08:21.480 --> 08:24.280
in the next 20 years, this is five years ago,

08:24.280 --> 08:26.120
was the economic and job impact.

08:26.120 --> 08:29.000
So I think that seems like a reasonable fear,

08:29.000 --> 08:30.840
but I think to your point,

08:30.840 --> 08:32.800
there is the actual species dominant stuff

08:32.800 --> 08:34.640
if we look 50 years out, 100 years out

08:34.640 --> 08:36.840
that I think is considerable as well.

08:37.680 --> 08:38.520
So yeah, you're right.

08:38.520 --> 08:40.400
I mean, AI in theory and AI in practice,

08:40.400 --> 08:42.680
it's a lot less predictable when it's off the paper.

08:42.680 --> 08:46.360
Social adoption is a big part of any kind of technology

08:46.360 --> 08:47.880
that would progress, right?

08:47.880 --> 08:52.880
So you can recommend certain things to a business

08:53.200 --> 08:57.000
and it might seem all good, a certain kind of a technology,

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
but when the society is rejecting that kind of technology,

09:00.000 --> 09:02.880
I bring up Google Glass, for example, as an example,

09:02.880 --> 09:04.440
that it was a very practical thing,

09:04.440 --> 09:08.640
well-designed and great, but people didn't like it.

09:08.640 --> 09:09.960
Some because they couldn't get it,

09:09.960 --> 09:12.040
some because they thought, oh, you're taking this,

09:12.040 --> 09:14.000
it jeopardizes my privacy

09:14.000 --> 09:15.120
and you think you're better than me

09:15.120 --> 09:16.720
and all those things, you know?

09:17.920 --> 09:20.520
Yeah, we did a very early interview in 2012

09:20.520 --> 09:23.680
with the head of Engadget at the time.

09:23.680 --> 09:26.120
Engadget is a big consumer tech blog

09:26.120 --> 09:27.680
who talked about his experience

09:27.680 --> 09:29.440
of wearing Google Glass in the subway

09:29.440 --> 09:31.200
and walking his dog and things like that

09:31.200 --> 09:34.040
and just how it wasn't really gonna fit

09:34.040 --> 09:36.480
into the normal mesh of society and the public.

09:36.480 --> 09:38.400
There was in San Francisco?

09:38.400 --> 09:41.320
I forget where Tim is based, Tim Stevens.

09:41.320 --> 09:43.080
This is a great many years ago,

09:43.080 --> 09:44.800
but I suspect it was the Bay Area.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.840
Yeah, because people were getting attacked.

09:46.840 --> 09:49.560
You know, there were videos taken by those,

09:49.560 --> 09:50.720
you know, people who were wearing it

09:50.720 --> 09:52.200
in bars and restaurants

09:52.200 --> 09:53.360
and people were getting attacked

09:53.360 --> 09:54.680
just because of wearing the glass.

09:54.680 --> 09:57.400
Part of it was the argument for privacy,

09:57.400 --> 09:58.840
but the other part was that, hey,

09:58.840 --> 10:01.200
this is not even something we can't buy from the store.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.320
This has to be given to you.

10:03.320 --> 10:06.000
Yeah, so it was like lording over people,

10:06.000 --> 10:07.720
kind of like, ah, I've been granted

10:07.720 --> 10:11.080
this recording intelligence layer

10:11.080 --> 10:11.920
and you don't have it.

10:11.920 --> 10:14.240
There's a certain kind of elitism

10:14.240 --> 10:16.760
that it seems like we can't get away with that.

10:16.760 --> 10:21.080
You know, genetic engineering is another field

10:21.080 --> 10:22.840
that will create this kind of elitism

10:22.840 --> 10:25.160
that, hey, if you can't afford it,

10:25.160 --> 10:28.320
not only financially, but also,

10:28.320 --> 10:30.120
you know, there's a big difference between China,

10:30.120 --> 10:31.360
let's say, and the United States,

10:31.360 --> 10:32.840
and I wanna talk to you about that too,

10:32.840 --> 10:35.080
because you mentioned you're talking to

10:35.080 --> 10:37.520
and you're advising private companies,

10:37.520 --> 10:39.760
but I also see on your website that you've spoken to,

10:39.760 --> 10:42.960
for example, United Nations, Harvard University.

10:42.960 --> 10:46.320
What was, oh, you talked to United Nations,

10:46.320 --> 10:49.000
as I see, about deepfakes, is that right?

10:49.000 --> 10:52.400
Yeah, so we actually, United Nations,

10:52.400 --> 10:54.640
World Bank, Interpol, the OECD,

10:54.640 --> 10:55.680
I mean, we work with-

10:55.680 --> 10:57.680
So beyond the private sector also.

10:57.680 --> 10:59.200
Yeah, these are the most substantial

10:59.200 --> 11:00.960
intergovernmental organizations in the world

11:01.160 --> 11:02.840
who are, luckily, at this point,

11:02.840 --> 11:05.800
at least allocating a certain amount of attention

11:05.800 --> 11:07.320
to artificial intelligence,

11:07.320 --> 11:08.520
and there are certainly initiatives

11:08.520 --> 11:09.960
that I really believe in there.

11:09.960 --> 11:13.040
And not all of those organizations

11:13.040 --> 11:14.880
are our clients, formally, some are.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.480
We've done substantial projects with the World Bank,

11:18.480 --> 11:20.640
for example, but some are just speaking engagements,

11:20.640 --> 11:22.800
because I happen to think it's a very valuable topic

11:22.800 --> 11:24.600
that should be at UN headquarters,

11:24.600 --> 11:26.080
and we were called upon to talk about it.

11:26.080 --> 11:28.840
So deepfakes is a good example of that,

11:28.840 --> 11:30.920
where I'm pretty close with the folks

11:31.920 --> 11:33.720
that run the artificial intelligence and robotics wing

11:33.720 --> 11:35.080
of what is called Unicrit,

11:35.080 --> 11:37.960
which is the crime and justice wing of the United Nations.

11:37.960 --> 11:40.200
I really respect those guys, I think they do a great job,

11:40.200 --> 11:42.840
and they have a thorough understanding of the space.

11:42.840 --> 11:45.800
Not everybody in the intergovernmental domain does.

11:45.800 --> 11:48.880
And they had called us in to essentially create a deepfake

11:48.880 --> 11:51.480
of the head of Unicrit, so a woman by the name of Bettina,

11:51.480 --> 11:54.600
who was the director of that wing of the United Nations.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.080
So we took a video of her,

11:56.080 --> 11:58.480
and then we made her say a bunch of things she never said,

11:58.480 --> 12:01.680
and then also extrapolated that into

12:01.680 --> 12:04.120
how almost anything can be programmatically generated,

12:04.120 --> 12:05.440
and how much better and better

12:05.440 --> 12:07.640
that programmatic generation is becoming,

12:07.640 --> 12:09.560
and what some of the considerations might be.

12:09.560 --> 12:11.880
My personal focus is on the long-term of that.

12:11.880 --> 12:14.200
Yes, political influence, I think, is something.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.520
Media and truth is something.

12:15.520 --> 12:18.800
I think the actual leap in the human experience,

12:18.800 --> 12:19.880
when we can push a button

12:19.880 --> 12:22.680
and have what we wish before our eyes,

12:22.680 --> 12:24.640
the conjuring of what we wish before our eyes,

12:24.640 --> 12:26.880
I think is a much grander transition

12:26.920 --> 12:29.880
than is spoken about in the purely political space.

12:29.880 --> 12:33.560
So I tried to create that stretch for UN leadership there.

12:33.560 --> 12:36.920
So democratization of information is the big picture,

12:36.920 --> 12:37.760
is what you're talking about,

12:37.760 --> 12:39.320
because it's not only deepfakes,

12:39.320 --> 12:41.600
but also, let's say, 3D printing,

12:41.600 --> 12:43.840
that now we have to deal with the very reality

12:43.840 --> 12:45.760
that within a couple of years,

12:45.760 --> 12:49.280
some parts of a gun can be very viably printed

12:49.280 --> 12:51.480
inside of someone's bedroom,

12:51.480 --> 12:54.120
and there's nothing anybody can do about it.

12:54.120 --> 12:56.400
Yeah, my personal expertise

12:56.400 --> 12:57.880
is not in 3D printing.

12:57.880 --> 12:59.760
We've done a couple bits of coverage

12:59.760 --> 13:02.560
on the intersection of what is called

13:02.560 --> 13:03.960
additive manufacturing,

13:03.960 --> 13:06.840
sort of the broad umbrella of 3D printing, and AI,

13:06.840 --> 13:08.520
so where those two mesh.

13:08.520 --> 13:11.360
But making projections around that tech,

13:11.360 --> 13:12.920
I have much less confidence than I do

13:12.920 --> 13:14.920
in, let's say, artificial intelligence

13:14.920 --> 13:16.600
in almost any industry.

13:16.600 --> 13:18.120
But yeah, to your point,

13:18.120 --> 13:19.520
that's part of the transition.

13:19.520 --> 13:22.440
I think what I'm articulating explicitly here

13:22.480 --> 13:26.960
is a broader dynamic of a kind of going in,

13:26.960 --> 13:30.840
so the majority, the bulk of our experience

13:30.840 --> 13:32.600
transitions into virtual spaces.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.880
So you and I are kind of doing that right now.

13:35.920 --> 13:37.800
I do that on my phone a good deal.

13:37.800 --> 13:40.120
We're all on a screen a really good percentage of the time,

13:40.120 --> 13:42.320
and if you look at human life

13:42.320 --> 13:45.360
and human life on screen time as a graph here,

13:45.360 --> 13:49.400
I mean, you don't have to be a rocket scientist.

13:49.440 --> 13:52.440
And I think that when we can call forth

13:52.440 --> 13:54.120
the kinds of experiences we want,

13:54.120 --> 13:56.520
whether it's a relaxing background to do our work,

13:56.520 --> 14:00.760
whether it's a movie that's created just for us, right?

14:00.760 --> 14:02.280
I wanna learn about the French Revolution,

14:02.280 --> 14:05.080
but I wanna learn about it through the eyes of St. Just,

14:05.080 --> 14:06.720
and I don't really care that much

14:06.720 --> 14:08.840
about the post-revolutionary Bonaparte stuff.

14:08.840 --> 14:11.680
I just wanna go right up until St. Just death, that's it,

14:11.680 --> 14:12.760
and I wanna look through his eyes.

14:12.760 --> 14:14.680
When a movie can be played

14:14.680 --> 14:16.440
per my preferences in creation

14:16.440 --> 14:17.800
and based on my past learning

14:18.080 --> 14:19.760
based on my current responsiveness, right?

14:19.760 --> 14:21.560
Am I attentive or is it boring me

14:21.560 --> 14:24.240
being able to have that generated in real time?

14:24.240 --> 14:26.040
I think that might be 15 years off,

14:26.040 --> 14:27.920
but I think that we get to a point

14:27.920 --> 14:31.280
where the compellingness of virtual ecosystems

14:31.280 --> 14:35.120
will be so amazing in terms of fulfilling drives

14:35.120 --> 14:37.880
for curiosity, creativity, for love,

14:37.880 --> 14:40.640
eventually with haptics that might involve sex.

14:40.640 --> 14:42.240
Lord knows how that's gonna evolve.

14:42.240 --> 14:43.680
That's not exactly my focus area,

14:43.680 --> 14:45.920
but I do think there's gonna be transitions there too,

14:45.920 --> 14:48.480
and I think that as the body becomes a husk

14:48.480 --> 14:51.880
and as most of what we wish in its highest form,

14:51.880 --> 14:53.720
right now, if you ask me, Dan,

14:53.720 --> 14:55.400
what is the most refreshing, rewarding,

14:55.400 --> 14:56.640
lovely thing that you could do,

14:56.640 --> 14:59.360
I would tell you it is walking in nature,

14:59.360 --> 15:02.720
reading actual papyrus in a really, really good book,

15:04.720 --> 15:06.080
like not Kindle, I mean like paper,

15:06.080 --> 15:08.760
I don't have ancient texts in my house,

15:08.760 --> 15:12.880
but I'm not, even if I was-

15:12.920 --> 15:14.960
I was gonna ask, you can't read papyrus?

15:15.840 --> 15:20.080
Even if I was exorbitantly wealthy,

15:20.080 --> 15:23.760
I would not become such a profligate

15:23.760 --> 15:25.880
in my collecting of texts like that,

15:25.880 --> 15:27.840
but I like me a good old book,

15:27.840 --> 15:31.520
and I like to breathe in the pine,

15:31.520 --> 15:35.200
and I like to see the sunset and those sorts of things,

15:35.200 --> 15:39.560
but I am not above the idea that within 15 years,

15:39.560 --> 15:42.240
a programmatically generated permutation of that,

15:42.240 --> 15:43.760
even the wind through my hair

15:43.760 --> 15:45.600
in a programmatically generated sense

15:45.600 --> 15:48.960
might be astronomically more refreshing,

15:48.960 --> 15:50.520
because it would be hyper-calibrated

15:50.520 --> 15:53.000
to all the very best experiences of that in the past,

15:53.000 --> 15:55.840
and that is in fact the transition I'm talking about.

15:55.840 --> 16:00.200
I wrote an article called Lotus Eaters and World Eaters,

16:00.200 --> 16:01.960
so Lotus Eaters and World Eaters.

16:01.960 --> 16:04.480
If Googled, that article would come up,

16:04.480 --> 16:06.080
and this is about the bigger transition.

16:06.080 --> 16:08.920
So for me, I think democratization of information

16:08.920 --> 16:10.400
is a very big part of it.

16:10.400 --> 16:13.040
I think that going in is the dynamic

16:13.040 --> 16:15.160
that I consider to be astronomically disruptive,

16:15.160 --> 16:16.920
and I think essentially a borderline

16:16.920 --> 16:18.360
no one is talking about.

16:18.360 --> 16:19.200
That's very interesting,

16:19.200 --> 16:21.760
because recently we've been talking about

16:21.760 --> 16:24.800
when people are talking about AI, artificial intelligence,

16:24.800 --> 16:27.120
and I like personally to think of that A

16:27.120 --> 16:28.960
as augmented intelligence as well,

16:28.960 --> 16:33.840
that you don't really have to reverse engineer

16:33.840 --> 16:36.520
and rebuild the entire brain or an intelligence.

16:36.520 --> 16:38.600
You can use it as a mesh net, basically,

16:38.600 --> 16:40.600
or exoskeleton, right?

16:40.600 --> 16:43.640
But the argument that I'm hearing is that AI

16:43.640 --> 16:47.520
is focused on the thinking mind, on the analytical mind,

16:47.520 --> 16:49.880
on the left brain, basically.

16:49.880 --> 16:53.200
The right brain and instincts

16:53.200 --> 16:56.480
and things we cannot really describe by words,

16:56.480 --> 16:58.360
that is something that we can't even begin

16:58.360 --> 17:01.480
to understand ourselves, let alone trying to replicate

17:01.480 --> 17:04.680
that with any kind of a machine intelligence.

17:04.680 --> 17:07.880
But that is a huge part of what you're talking about,

17:07.880 --> 17:12.280
to merging, basically, within blurring this line

17:12.280 --> 17:14.000
of what is real and what is not real

17:14.000 --> 17:16.600
further and further in the coming years.

17:16.600 --> 17:21.600
Yeah, and I would say, so I may not describe it similarly.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.400
I think it's an interesting distinction,

17:24.400 --> 17:25.400
the left and right brain.

17:25.400 --> 17:29.840
I would say that certainly at an emotive level,

17:29.840 --> 17:31.760
I don't think we're able to replicate,

17:31.760 --> 17:32.720
to the best of our knowledge,

17:32.720 --> 17:34.920
we're not able to replicate sentience in AI,

17:34.920 --> 17:37.200
although we did do a pretty extensive poll

17:37.200 --> 17:38.920
of artificial intelligence researchers

17:38.920 --> 17:40.680
around when sentience might be possible,

17:40.680 --> 17:42.040
something like 2060.

17:42.040 --> 17:43.160
Who knows if they're right, right?

17:43.160 --> 17:44.840
Nobody knows if anybody's right.

17:44.840 --> 17:46.440
But I'm curious about the topic.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.640
Consciousness, I think, is a morally worthy thing.

17:48.640 --> 17:50.240
It might be the morally worthy thing,

17:50.240 --> 17:52.880
but that's its own conversational threat.

17:52.880 --> 17:54.600
But right and left brain, I think,

17:54.600 --> 17:56.640
it's tough to say where AI actually sits,

17:56.640 --> 17:59.640
because, for example, if we look at

17:59.640 --> 18:01.320
the programmatically generated stuff,

18:01.320 --> 18:03.680
in the future, let's say 10 years from now,

18:03.680 --> 18:07.440
if you are a designer of logos, like company logos,

18:07.440 --> 18:10.160
you will not just take 15 hours

18:10.160 --> 18:11.880
to craft one really good logo

18:11.880 --> 18:13.200
and then take another 15 hours

18:13.200 --> 18:14.920
to craft another really good logo.

18:14.920 --> 18:19.920
You may begin with simply a verbalized

18:20.800 --> 18:24.880
or set of checkboxes, set of configurable features,

18:24.880 --> 18:27.600
like what are the values we want to convey,

18:27.600 --> 18:29.520
what are the values we stand for as a company,

18:29.520 --> 18:30.960
what kind of color palettes are we thinking

18:30.960 --> 18:32.080
might be good, whatever,

18:32.080 --> 18:36.160
and have a programmatically generated plethora of logos

18:36.160 --> 18:37.840
that are already stacked and ranked

18:37.840 --> 18:39.600
based on what we would presume

18:39.600 --> 18:41.720
humans would respond to most favorably

18:41.720 --> 18:43.520
based on the values that we had set before.

18:43.520 --> 18:45.400
Now, we would need a really big data set

18:45.400 --> 18:47.360
of people looking at different logos

18:47.360 --> 18:48.560
and correlating them with values,

18:48.560 --> 18:49.720
and we're not there yet.

18:49.720 --> 18:52.960
But if nothing else, we could start with a plethora,

18:52.960 --> 18:55.240
and we could take individual permutations,

18:55.240 --> 18:57.240
determine some tweaks, determine some adjustments,

18:57.240 --> 19:00.000
and create another plethora off of that one permutation,

19:00.040 --> 19:02.720
and in so doing, generate just generally

19:02.720 --> 19:05.560
better and more ideas, better and more ideas.

19:05.560 --> 19:07.800
Same with architecture, same with fashion,

19:07.800 --> 19:10.320
same with textiles, same with name your damn

19:10.320 --> 19:12.320
creative domain, creating beats.

19:12.320 --> 19:14.120
You want to create music for the elevator,

19:14.120 --> 19:15.560
you want to create rap music.

19:15.560 --> 19:17.200
I mean, being able to just have

19:17.200 --> 19:18.600
programmatically generated beats

19:18.600 --> 19:19.760
that we know are going to hit,

19:19.760 --> 19:20.960
that we know are going to respond,

19:20.960 --> 19:22.240
that people are going to respond well to.

19:22.240 --> 19:24.000
We might train it off of Spotify data

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
in terms of what's most popular right now.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.760
We might train it off of whatever we want to do.

19:28.760 --> 19:31.400
This sort of extension of what you might refer to

19:31.400 --> 19:34.120
as the left brain will eventually become the norm

19:34.120 --> 19:35.480
in a great many creative fields.

19:35.480 --> 19:36.920
Now, is that going to be 10 years?

19:36.920 --> 19:37.840
Is that going to be 15 years?

19:37.840 --> 19:40.080
I can't exactly tell you, but I will say

19:40.080 --> 19:41.960
there was a time where as a graphic designer,

19:41.960 --> 19:43.600
you didn't need to know how to use a computer.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.680
And let me tell you, my good man, times have changed.

19:46.680 --> 19:48.080
And let me tell you, my good man,

19:48.080 --> 19:50.480
in 15 years, times will change again.

19:50.480 --> 19:53.560
And this kind of technology will be part of that change.

19:54.920 --> 19:57.360
I think a good point of distinction,

19:57.360 --> 20:00.000
you mentioned with music, for example.

20:00.920 --> 20:03.440
What constitutes better

20:03.440 --> 20:06.520
is the context that already exists, right?

20:06.520 --> 20:09.760
That is determined based on us, humans,

20:09.760 --> 20:12.880
who are, we are very limited in our experience.

20:12.880 --> 20:14.320
It's linear.

20:14.320 --> 20:17.840
And the argument can be made that for AI

20:17.840 --> 20:20.600
to reaches its true potential,

20:20.600 --> 20:23.680
it should not rely on humanity whatsoever.

20:23.680 --> 20:28.280
So after that point, the argument would become,

20:28.280 --> 20:31.080
would the AI, artificial intelligence,

20:31.080 --> 20:35.480
be able to create a beat or a piece of music

20:35.480 --> 20:38.840
that has absolutely no root within the context

20:38.840 --> 20:41.160
that is created by human civilization

20:41.160 --> 20:42.920
and is something that is introducing

20:42.920 --> 20:45.280
a new context altogether?

20:45.280 --> 20:46.440
Does it make sense?

20:46.440 --> 20:48.000
Yes, it does.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.760
And I don't know if you wanted to go

20:49.760 --> 20:51.040
this far down the rabbit hole,

20:51.040 --> 20:53.720
but there isn't a depth that you could go

20:53.720 --> 20:54.720
that I will not follow you.

20:54.720 --> 20:55.960
Oh, amazing.

20:55.960 --> 20:57.800
I'm mostly interested in rabbit holes

20:57.800 --> 21:00.080
because academic sides, I'm like,

21:00.080 --> 21:02.000
everything is written on Google.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.560
There are so many people who can nail those things better,

21:04.560 --> 21:07.280
but I think it's very important to be imaginative

21:07.280 --> 21:09.280
and consider many different options

21:09.280 --> 21:11.720
that we have to deal with in the coming years.

21:11.720 --> 21:13.960
I think these are interesting topics.

21:13.960 --> 21:15.800
Again, they aren't things that I'd be called upon

21:15.800 --> 21:18.160
to speak about at Interpol or at Citibank,

21:18.920 --> 21:21.200
but they are the long ball consequences

21:21.200 --> 21:23.320
that I think, as you pointed out,

21:23.320 --> 21:25.200
it's important to kind of splay those open

21:25.200 --> 21:26.320
and see what does this mean?

21:26.320 --> 21:27.320
Where does this go?

21:27.320 --> 21:28.800
To your point about music,

21:28.800 --> 21:30.600
I think the question here would be

21:30.600 --> 21:32.440
what would be the purpose of music?

21:32.440 --> 21:34.400
If the purpose is enjoyment

21:34.400 --> 21:36.440
and we are the only sentient things that enjoys,

21:36.440 --> 21:40.040
then I suspect you're right.

21:40.040 --> 21:42.240
We may be able to start from scratch

21:42.240 --> 21:45.280
and create beats and permutations of sound

21:45.280 --> 21:49.320
that really don't resemble any known musical genre

21:49.320 --> 21:52.400
that might be extremely appealing to some people.

21:52.400 --> 21:54.720
Very rare that music would be appealing to everybody,

21:54.720 --> 21:57.080
but that might be doable.

21:57.080 --> 22:00.640
Now, if AI itself could become sentient in some sense,

22:00.640 --> 22:02.200
maybe it would create,

22:02.200 --> 22:04.360
if artificial general intelligence

22:04.360 --> 22:06.520
were to create art for itself, two things.

22:06.520 --> 22:09.520
A, it's extremely unlikely we would be able to understand it,

22:09.520 --> 22:11.920
and B, it's extremely unlikely it would have a form

22:11.920 --> 22:12.880
that we now recognize.

22:12.880 --> 22:14.600
It's not gonna be carving marble.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.560
It's not gonna be fricking oil paints.

22:16.560 --> 22:19.200
It's gonna be something astronomically more complicated,

22:19.200 --> 22:20.080
and from the viewpoint

22:20.080 --> 22:22.560
of something astronomically more intelligent,

22:22.560 --> 22:24.560
it'll be astronomically more beautiful.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.160
The language of such an entity,

22:26.160 --> 22:27.160
we might think about it,

22:27.160 --> 22:29.000
like you and I have an alphabet.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
We're speaking English right now.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
You may speak other languages, I don't.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.960
I pretend to have a fistful of French words,

22:34.960 --> 22:37.120
but I go no farther.

22:37.120 --> 22:39.160
I'm an uncultured American.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.320
History, I'm pretty strong, but languages.

22:43.160 --> 22:46.240
Let's presume we're talking about the English alphabet.

22:46.240 --> 22:48.920
We've got a couple dozen letters to work with here,

22:50.040 --> 22:53.400
and we can only talk at this current bandwidth.

22:53.400 --> 22:56.840
An AGI might have a number of symbols

22:56.840 --> 22:58.040
that it might communicate with,

22:58.040 --> 22:59.960
either itself or other AGI's.

22:59.960 --> 23:04.200
We might imagine a cube of a million pixels this way,

23:04.200 --> 23:05.360
and a million pixels this way,

23:05.360 --> 23:07.640
and a million pixels this way,

23:07.640 --> 23:09.240
and each of those pixels can have

23:09.240 --> 23:11.560
one of two trillion different permutations

23:11.560 --> 23:13.480
of what we want to call it,

23:13.480 --> 23:15.520
like color number, what have you,

23:15.520 --> 23:18.640
and that any combination of all of that

23:18.640 --> 23:20.320
pushed through is like a letter.

23:21.400 --> 23:25.280
And so we couldn't possibly imagine

23:25.280 --> 23:27.680
the full extent of what expression would be

23:27.680 --> 23:29.120
for something beyond us,

23:29.120 --> 23:32.520
no better than a caterpillar could imagine our expression,

23:32.520 --> 23:34.680
could imagine Shakespeare's sonnets,

23:34.680 --> 23:38.440
could imagine great architecture,

23:38.440 --> 23:40.400
Corinthian columns.

23:40.400 --> 23:42.160
Caterpillars ain't gonna cut that mustard,

23:42.160 --> 23:43.400
and we ain't gonna cut the mustard

23:43.400 --> 23:45.240
of what's beyond us either.

23:45.240 --> 23:48.600
Yeah, we are creating a new and different kind of a species

23:48.600 --> 23:51.200
than humanity, and I think this is very important

23:51.200 --> 23:54.000
for people to understand that this is not a phase

23:54.000 --> 23:56.960
or a trend that's just gonna go away,

23:56.960 --> 23:58.960
and in 10 years, people will be in charge

23:58.960 --> 24:00.240
of everything again.

24:00.240 --> 24:02.760
Like, it's just not gonna happen.

24:02.760 --> 24:04.200
Yeah, I think a lot of people do operate

24:04.200 --> 24:06.200
under that assumption, though.

24:06.200 --> 24:09.600
I think it is really seen as a very short-term transition.

24:09.640 --> 24:11.840
Is it also shared within governments and UN

24:11.840 --> 24:13.880
and those places that you talk at?

24:13.880 --> 24:16.120
Yeah, I mean, in the broad sweep,

24:16.120 --> 24:19.640
so my unabashed long-term objective here

24:19.640 --> 24:21.680
is to bring what I refer to as

24:21.680 --> 24:24.480
the trajectory of intelligence conversation

24:24.480 --> 24:28.680
into these organizations which I have a relationship with.

24:28.680 --> 24:30.680
However, I'm not here to impose that

24:30.680 --> 24:33.080
when it's not a time that they're interested about it, right?

24:33.080 --> 24:34.520
I have certain people within these orgs

24:34.520 --> 24:36.880
that I can talk about all manner of topics,

24:37.680 --> 24:40.160
but for many, the reason I'm called on

24:40.160 --> 24:43.480
is because we study what's possible and what's working,

24:43.480 --> 24:45.120
so they're gonna have an academic,

24:45.120 --> 24:47.760
they might have an expert in computer vision,

24:47.760 --> 24:49.960
but they need somebody who's gonna say,

24:49.960 --> 24:51.640
well, here's where it's impacting this industry,

24:51.640 --> 24:53.240
here's where it's impacting the industry,

24:53.240 --> 24:54.560
here's what makes it hard to adopt,

24:54.560 --> 24:56.840
here's what makes it easy to adopt in defense,

24:56.840 --> 24:58.880
here's what, they need a reality check

24:58.880 --> 25:00.320
on where it's impacting the world,

25:00.320 --> 25:02.960
and that's why I step into the World Bank

25:02.960 --> 25:04.880
to enter poll, et cetera.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.720
So I'm not gonna force feed them that stuff,

25:06.720 --> 25:08.120
but it is my unabashed goal

25:08.120 --> 25:10.000
to eventually be able to introduce these themes,

25:10.000 --> 25:11.160
and we have a new series,

25:11.160 --> 25:13.480
we have a podcast called the AI in Business podcast,

25:13.480 --> 25:15.920
and we have a Saturday series called AI Futures,

25:15.920 --> 25:17.240
where we're kind of stretching this,

25:17.240 --> 25:19.560
we're taking people from reputable organizations,

25:19.560 --> 25:20.600
like let's say Berkeley,

25:20.600 --> 25:23.440
Stuart Russell was our first guest on this podcast,

25:23.440 --> 25:27.840
the OECD, folks from the Future of Humanity Institute

25:27.840 --> 25:30.480
at Oxford, and we're having them kind of stretch

25:30.480 --> 25:31.600
the credible viewpoints

25:31.600 --> 25:33.760
into where is this ultimately taking us?

25:33.760 --> 25:35.920
Because for me, I think we do need to consider those things,

25:36.240 --> 25:39.040
to your point, right now in government and in business,

25:39.040 --> 25:41.800
it is absolutely not on the radar.

25:41.800 --> 25:43.640
It's not even fiction,

25:43.640 --> 25:46.720
it's literally not on the table in any way.

25:46.720 --> 25:48.880
It's not even digestible, it's almost invisible,

25:48.880 --> 25:50.280
even if it were to be articulated,

25:50.280 --> 25:53.760
it would not even land on the table, it doesn't exist.

25:53.760 --> 25:55.280
And it's shared in politics.

25:55.280 --> 25:57.000
I mean, you see how important AI is,

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
and nobody's really talking about it.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Nobody's talking about the long-term, no.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.800
Even short-term, you see like neither Trump or Biden

26:04.840 --> 26:06.160
are really talking about AI,

26:06.160 --> 26:08.480
but AI is going to have huge impacts

26:08.480 --> 26:11.240
on every single human being's lives on this planet.

26:11.240 --> 26:14.080
And I think, so what is it to be a politician?

26:15.120 --> 26:17.400
Just winning a popularity contest.

26:19.240 --> 26:21.120
In Emerson's words,

26:21.120 --> 26:23.360
to eat dust before the men

26:23.360 --> 26:25.080
who actually stand behind the throne,

26:25.080 --> 26:26.680
something akin to this.

26:26.680 --> 26:29.680
Now, I don't know, I'm not disparaging politicians,

26:29.680 --> 26:30.960
not even in the slightest.

26:30.960 --> 26:33.080
In fact, I do respect the profession

26:33.080 --> 26:36.680
despite the gritty realities they're in.

26:39.200 --> 26:40.800
But to be a politician, like you said,

26:40.800 --> 26:42.000
yes, popularity contest.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.040
So why aren't they talking about AI?

26:44.040 --> 26:47.960
It just doesn't matter enough to the constituents, right?

26:47.960 --> 26:51.320
Why are they talking about name your topic, sir?

26:51.320 --> 26:52.400
Name your topic.

26:52.400 --> 26:54.240
I mean, the most arbitrary things

26:54.240 --> 26:56.320
become giant friction points,

26:56.320 --> 26:58.560
and then they get in all the speeches.

26:58.560 --> 27:00.560
Is it because of their inherent meaning

27:00.560 --> 27:02.520
and some platonic reality?

27:02.520 --> 27:03.720
No, no, no.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.920
It's simply because they resonate with the constituency.

27:05.920 --> 27:08.320
So we can expect AI to land

27:08.320 --> 27:13.080
on the sort of political speech table

27:13.080 --> 27:16.440
when it matters to the people who are being spoken to.

27:16.440 --> 27:18.720
Yeah, the disruption of AI and technology

27:18.720 --> 27:22.080
basically are not in any shape or form

27:22.080 --> 27:23.960
determined by the political will

27:23.960 --> 27:25.800
or social will to accept them though.

27:25.800 --> 27:28.280
That's the thing, like you're talking about deep fakes.

27:28.280 --> 27:32.280
Deep fakes will come and disrupt future political campaigns

27:32.720 --> 27:35.520
from the perspective of constituents and the politicians

27:35.520 --> 27:37.200
and all of them altogether

27:37.200 --> 27:40.200
without anybody agreeing or disagreeing with them.

27:40.200 --> 27:44.520
It does not require agreement of people

27:44.520 --> 27:46.840
to go in that certain kind of a speed

27:46.840 --> 27:48.600
that technology is evolving, right?

27:48.600 --> 27:52.200
So it's important to at least acknowledge

27:52.200 --> 27:57.200
the huge disruption that we haven't seen anything of it yet.

27:57.280 --> 27:58.840
Because what we are experiencing right now,

27:58.880 --> 28:03.360
is this seemingly division that exists globally, really.

28:03.360 --> 28:05.640
A lot of people can say that this is because people

28:05.640 --> 28:08.320
finally have channels of expressions

28:08.320 --> 28:11.240
in the form of social media that now they can be heard.

28:12.200 --> 28:13.280
When you say division, by the way,

28:13.280 --> 28:15.960
I just want to follow you, what do you mean?

28:15.960 --> 28:17.480
So division, for example,

28:17.480 --> 28:19.480
what is being portrayed by the media

28:19.480 --> 28:22.080
and what is being portrayed by certain news media?

28:22.080 --> 28:25.560
Division right and left, division upper and lower class.

28:25.560 --> 28:27.080
I mean, what is the core division?

28:27.120 --> 28:28.800
Political, political division.

28:28.800 --> 28:30.120
Yeah, because the class division,

28:30.120 --> 28:31.760
nobody really wants to talk about.

28:33.280 --> 28:35.240
I don't know enough about the class division

28:35.240 --> 28:37.280
to have a firm opinion on that, but okay.

28:37.280 --> 28:40.080
So you're talking about the more or less

28:40.080 --> 28:41.360
the left and right to some degree.

28:41.360 --> 28:42.680
Right, right.

28:43.600 --> 28:47.960
Like this recent example of the video

28:47.960 --> 28:51.960
of George Floyd getting killed by the police,

28:51.960 --> 28:56.120
which is horrible, and it started a lot of consequences

28:56.120 --> 28:57.360
as a result of it.

28:57.360 --> 29:00.360
But in a couple of years, a fake video can come up

29:00.360 --> 29:03.200
of a very same kind of a thing

29:03.200 --> 29:06.520
that half of the audience and half of the viewers

29:06.520 --> 29:08.600
will believe it right off the bat.

29:08.600 --> 29:11.000
Well, this is going to have very real consequences

29:11.000 --> 29:12.440
socially and politically.

29:12.440 --> 29:17.040
Yeah, you know, this really is on my mind a lot.

29:17.040 --> 29:20.120
So, I mean, again, UN, I've been on,

29:20.120 --> 29:22.960
I was in television in Singapore on this same topic.

29:22.960 --> 29:24.360
What does this mean for the future?

29:24.360 --> 29:26.680
And also with reference to this political division,

29:26.680 --> 29:27.920
I've thought a lot about it.

29:27.920 --> 29:32.920
And on some level, I didn't see it coming as fast as it was.

29:33.600 --> 29:36.760
So I was at Facebook headquarters in 2016.

29:36.760 --> 29:38.520
You're talking about Deepfakes.

29:38.520 --> 29:39.480
No, I wasn't talking about Deepfakes,

29:39.480 --> 29:42.040
but I was at Facebook headquarters in 2016

29:42.040 --> 29:44.200
talking to the head of core machine learning at the time,

29:44.200 --> 29:46.120
fellow by the name of Hussein Mahena,

29:46.120 --> 29:48.600
very sharp fellow, I think he's with Google now.

29:48.600 --> 29:51.240
They always swap around over there.

29:51.240 --> 29:55.040
There's only so many places to go in SF,

29:55.040 --> 29:56.360
but a really sharp fellow.

29:56.360 --> 29:59.960
And I recall only very lightly talking about

29:59.960 --> 30:01.880
what was beginning to rattle.

30:01.880 --> 30:03.200
This is before Trump was elected.

30:03.200 --> 30:07.520
What was beginning to rattle is this idea of echo chambers

30:07.520 --> 30:09.000
for political perspectives.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.480
And I thought to myself, you know,

30:10.480 --> 30:12.920
I'm not seeing that much of it just yet right now

30:12.920 --> 30:14.400
in my own experience.

30:14.400 --> 30:17.240
I don't really see that as like the real workhorse

30:17.240 --> 30:19.440
of, you know, friction in society.

30:19.440 --> 30:21.280
But by golly, four years later,

30:22.560 --> 30:25.080
you know, I can tell you that the echo chamber thing,

30:25.080 --> 30:27.200
it's not just, well, more people have a voice

30:27.200 --> 30:28.840
and that's why they're fighting each other.

30:28.840 --> 30:32.280
I would actually push back on that idea very firmly.

30:32.280 --> 30:33.800
I would push back on that idea.

30:33.800 --> 30:38.480
I suspect that there are mounted incentives

30:38.480 --> 30:41.320
and money to be made and influence to be wielded

30:42.400 --> 30:47.400
that sort of make incessant division just work, right?

30:47.920 --> 30:49.560
I mean, who has a Twitter following

30:49.560 --> 30:52.520
more than 100,000 people who isn't primarily

30:52.520 --> 30:55.120
basing it on a for or against or an affinity, right?

30:55.120 --> 30:57.720
Oh, you know, I run a puppy kennel or something,

30:57.720 --> 31:00.440
or I like take pictures on the beach

31:00.440 --> 31:01.320
and I'm an attractive woman.

31:01.320 --> 31:02.920
Like, sort them out.

31:02.920 --> 31:06.240
Intellectuals, you're gonna pop off

31:06.240 --> 31:07.720
if you can have a strong enemy, right?

31:07.720 --> 31:09.420
Because you've already got a huge resonance.

31:09.420 --> 31:11.120
If you're kind of middle of the road,

31:11.120 --> 31:13.340
it's like you're the enemy of both, man.

31:14.320 --> 31:16.720
And I think that what I like about Boston

31:16.720 --> 31:18.560
is it's actually okay to be middle of the road.

31:18.560 --> 31:20.720
I am, I'm tied to neither political party.

31:20.720 --> 31:23.000
You can do that and not be a bad guy.

31:23.000 --> 31:27.760
In San Francisco, I mean, you're essentially a Bible thumper.

31:27.760 --> 31:30.080
Now, I've never read the Bible, but oddly enough,

31:30.080 --> 31:32.760
I'm close to being one in the Bay Area.

31:32.760 --> 31:36.280
And you with that American flag, I would not recommend.

31:36.280 --> 31:38.600
So you doing that within 20 miles of San Francisco,

31:38.600 --> 31:40.280
I would not recommend it.

31:40.280 --> 31:42.880
And you know, I was a refugee in Canada

31:42.880 --> 31:45.640
and I'm an ex-Muslim immigrant in the US.

31:45.960 --> 31:46.800
And I'm glad we have you.

31:46.800 --> 31:48.080
I'm glad it's helping out.

31:48.080 --> 31:52.040
All it takes is one, quote unquote,

31:52.040 --> 31:54.720
wrong interpretation of the US flag, for example,

31:54.720 --> 31:56.680
which I had in my room in Tehran.

31:56.680 --> 32:00.080
You know, United States is a beacon of light still.

32:00.080 --> 32:01.480
For people all around the world,

32:01.480 --> 32:03.480
you see protesters in Hong Kong

32:03.480 --> 32:05.240
under that kind of a situation,

32:05.240 --> 32:06.720
they're waving the American flags.

32:06.720 --> 32:11.440
It has a meaning beyond politics and geography.

32:11.440 --> 32:13.880
Yeah, I hope it retains that meaning, that's my hope.

32:13.880 --> 32:14.720
I agree.

32:14.760 --> 32:17.000
I'm not here calling America good ubiquitously, right?

32:17.000 --> 32:18.520
I'm obviously not doing that.

32:18.520 --> 32:21.160
But I am saying that it's a shame

32:21.160 --> 32:23.000
when it's ubiquitously seen as evil,

32:23.000 --> 32:25.560
because I think we actually have a lot more in common

32:25.560 --> 32:27.600
that hopefully we can get along with,

32:27.600 --> 32:29.720
but technology is certainly veering us away

32:29.720 --> 32:32.160
from having concord here.

32:32.160 --> 32:36.200
Yeah, it also shows deeper parts of human nature, right?

32:36.200 --> 32:39.240
Like what you were saying that people depend on division

32:39.240 --> 32:41.240
in order to capitalize on it.

32:41.240 --> 32:44.360
This is something that is very deeply woven

32:44.360 --> 32:45.920
within who we are.

32:45.920 --> 32:49.680
Oh yes, oh yes, the tribe, sir, the tribe.

32:49.680 --> 32:50.640
Yeah.

32:50.640 --> 32:53.400
I mean, you know, we are a tribal species

32:53.400 --> 32:56.920
and us versus them is the automatic frame.

32:56.920 --> 33:01.920
It takes vigilant volitional effort

33:02.440 --> 33:06.280
to do anything other than think us versus them

33:06.280 --> 33:08.240
in almost all circumstances.

33:08.240 --> 33:10.400
I mean, maybe that's a bit of a stretch,

33:10.400 --> 33:13.360
but to be frank, it's quite clearly the norm.

33:13.360 --> 33:16.120
You know, anyone who considers themselves

33:16.120 --> 33:18.160
free entirely of that dynamic,

33:18.160 --> 33:20.840
I think is generally fooling themselves to a spooky degree.

33:20.840 --> 33:23.880
I think we should be aware of just how consistent

33:23.880 --> 33:24.800
and vigilant we have to be

33:24.800 --> 33:28.240
and that we're never gonna be perfect in that category.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.720
But I hope we can work at it.

33:29.720 --> 33:31.240
I don't think we're doing a great job right now

33:31.240 --> 33:32.640
as a country.

33:32.640 --> 33:35.720
As a country, yeah, especially with China

33:35.720 --> 33:37.480
on the other side of the equation.

33:38.440 --> 33:39.360
Yeah, all right, you want to?

33:39.360 --> 33:42.360
Yeah, let's get in there.

33:43.360 --> 33:44.200
Yeah.

33:46.480 --> 33:48.360
I remember talking to someone in Toronto

33:48.360 --> 33:52.720
a couple of years ago at a Toronto transhumanist meetup

33:52.720 --> 33:54.920
and we talked for like three hours.

33:54.920 --> 33:55.760
It's awesome.

33:55.760 --> 33:57.480
And at the end, it was like, you know,

33:57.480 --> 33:59.960
the really only three things matter in this world,

33:59.960 --> 34:02.040
China, United States and what they do

34:02.040 --> 34:04.600
with artificial intelligence.

34:04.600 --> 34:06.200
And this was a couple of years ago

34:06.200 --> 34:09.640
and it seems to be the case.

34:09.640 --> 34:12.400
My friends in Paris would be angry if I agreed with you.

34:12.400 --> 34:14.480
So I'm gonna pretend to disagree with you.

34:16.480 --> 34:17.880
Please expand on that.

34:17.880 --> 34:18.800
Yeah, yeah.

34:22.800 --> 34:24.080
I would take a lot of flack.

34:24.080 --> 34:26.840
No, I mean, what for you is interesting

34:26.840 --> 34:28.560
about the US China AI race?

34:28.560 --> 34:30.680
I mean, I think about this incessantly

34:30.680 --> 34:33.240
and I think about this from a defense perspective.

34:33.240 --> 34:34.800
I think about this from a media perspective.

34:34.800 --> 34:36.760
I spoke in Shanghai for the United Nations.

34:36.760 --> 34:39.160
I've interviewed a tremendous number of companies

34:39.160 --> 34:42.160
with co-founders in China that are in the AI space

34:42.160 --> 34:46.480
as well as investors in the Asian AI ecosystem.

34:46.480 --> 34:48.840
And so I have vantage points

34:50.040 --> 34:53.960
that have fleshed this out pretty reasonably thoroughly.

34:53.960 --> 34:56.080
I mean, I'm not an expert in its entirety,

34:56.080 --> 34:59.680
but what makes it interesting for you?

34:59.680 --> 35:01.120
What's important about that dynamic?

35:01.120 --> 35:03.600
What's interesting to me is within the context

35:03.600 --> 35:06.640
of human nature, the tribalism that we talked about

35:06.640 --> 35:09.400
and how we have always used technology as a tool

35:09.400 --> 35:12.160
in order to pursue our human intentions.

35:12.160 --> 35:14.920
And the biggest tribes right now I see in the world

35:14.920 --> 35:19.920
is the Chinese Communist Party and the United States

35:19.960 --> 35:23.120
government that they're clearly in conflict with each other,

35:23.120 --> 35:25.800
which creates, competition is always good

35:25.800 --> 35:27.840
to develop new things.

35:27.840 --> 35:32.240
It creates like space race and a lot of our technology

35:32.240 --> 35:36.280
is contribution of the wars that we have fought, right?

35:36.280 --> 35:38.480
But at the end of the day, it's very important

35:38.480 --> 35:42.800
to understand that AI is perhaps the ultimate tool

35:42.800 --> 35:46.000
and ultimate depending on the intention

35:46.000 --> 35:48.280
can be used as a weapon, can be used as like,

35:48.280 --> 35:49.600
it's like any other tool, you know,

35:49.600 --> 35:51.280
with fire you can warm yourself up

35:51.280 --> 35:53.000
or burn down your entire building.

35:53.880 --> 35:56.880
And it's very interesting to me because I know China

35:56.880 --> 36:00.640
has access to more data than United States

36:00.640 --> 36:03.720
and US is kind of, now please correct me if I'm wrong,

36:03.720 --> 36:06.960
but it seems like US is lagging behind China

36:06.960 --> 36:10.000
specifically because of the decentralized system

36:10.000 --> 36:13.720
that the US has versus a centrally driven group

36:13.720 --> 36:15.800
of engineers in China that were like,

36:15.800 --> 36:19.040
this is our objective, we're gonna get it no matter how.

36:19.040 --> 36:21.160
And in the United States, you have to, you know,

36:21.160 --> 36:24.360
argue about the definition of the word, for example,

36:24.360 --> 36:29.080
is for many months, costing millions and millions of dollars.

36:29.080 --> 36:31.880
Yeah, and I mean, the communist system,

36:31.880 --> 36:35.520
never having worked within it or understanding it

36:35.520 --> 36:38.640
to a great extent, I'm sure has its own hiccups

36:38.640 --> 36:42.040
and what we might refer to as inefficiencies

36:42.040 --> 36:46.160
with corruption and, you know, however that operates.

36:46.160 --> 36:50.440
But to your point, so I wrote a rather in-depth article

36:50.440 --> 36:52.760
called The Seven Weaknesses of the West.

36:52.760 --> 36:55.120
So someone typed eMERGE, E-M-E-R-J,

36:55.120 --> 36:57.720
Seven Weaknesses of the West, they'd find it on Google.

36:57.720 --> 36:59.960
And this really summarizes a lot of what I consider

36:59.960 --> 37:02.040
to be where we're behind the eight ball with China.

37:02.040 --> 37:04.680
Now the United States, I did another very lengthy piece

37:04.680 --> 37:07.240
on the AI and China ecosystem, how it's developing,

37:07.240 --> 37:09.280
how it's evolving, the kinds of startups, et cetera.

37:09.280 --> 37:12.720
That's its own bit of research I believe is free as well.

37:12.720 --> 37:17.360
But we have more academic muscle.

37:17.360 --> 37:21.240
We have more actual scientists

37:21.240 --> 37:23.920
and actual scientists who have experience deploying it,

37:23.920 --> 37:26.280
which is a really, really good distinction

37:26.280 --> 37:29.200
because coming out of Carnegie Mellon is kinda neat,

37:29.200 --> 37:30.400
you know, like you're not dumb.

37:30.400 --> 37:31.960
That's awesome, that's great.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.560
But actually having experience,

37:34.560 --> 37:36.520
turning that into a user experience

37:36.520 --> 37:39.760
or reducing money laundering in a bank

37:39.760 --> 37:43.480
or improving retention for a subscription service,

37:43.480 --> 37:48.480
that's a much more robust, practical, applicable experience.

37:48.960 --> 37:50.280
And that's frankly not something

37:50.280 --> 37:51.440
you can get in purely academia.

37:51.440 --> 37:53.640
So we have certainly some edges here.

37:54.920 --> 37:56.640
And I think some people are optimistic

37:56.640 --> 37:58.120
that the free market system

37:58.120 --> 38:00.720
will also just be more creative writ large.

38:00.720 --> 38:04.640
That said, there are a lot of disadvantages.

38:04.640 --> 38:06.840
And a lot of them I think have to do with,

38:06.840 --> 38:08.160
you mentioned centralization.

38:08.160 --> 38:10.160
I think a lot of this ties to the ability

38:10.160 --> 38:12.760
for the Chinese Communist Party

38:12.760 --> 38:15.720
to marshal a united front of effort.

38:15.720 --> 38:17.600
And that involves many factors here.

38:17.600 --> 38:19.720
That involves the private sector and academia

38:19.720 --> 38:23.960
essentially just being wings of the great and ruling power.

38:23.960 --> 38:27.960
So being nothing more but wings, nothing more.

38:28.280 --> 38:31.080
That's a very powerful and lovely place to be.

38:31.080 --> 38:36.080
And in fact, Confucius, there's no better setup.

38:36.760 --> 38:38.840
So Xi Jinping, if your objective

38:38.840 --> 38:43.120
was to rule without question,

38:43.120 --> 38:46.240
Xi Jinping would be, I mean, I think he's in a great spot.

38:46.240 --> 38:48.160
I mean, if that was your goal, Ryan, I'm just saying

38:48.160 --> 38:49.880
if it was your goal, he's in the best spot.

38:49.880 --> 38:51.040
Objectively speaking.

38:51.040 --> 38:56.040
There is no, pericles is not revered in China, right?

38:57.040 --> 39:00.760
The Socrates and Christ of China

39:00.760 --> 39:03.160
would be Confucius almost unquestionably.

39:03.160 --> 39:06.280
And man, I mean, Confucius is real congenial

39:06.280 --> 39:10.120
to everything lining up to the great emperor.

39:10.120 --> 39:12.400
Now I'm not saying Confucius advocates for tyranny.

39:12.400 --> 39:14.640
In fact, I think it's pretty clear he doesn't.

39:14.640 --> 39:19.320
But it can be bent and molded so sweetly, so snuggly

39:19.320 --> 39:21.880
in a nice, obedient alignment.

39:21.880 --> 39:24.000
And I think so culturally, he sits in just

39:24.040 --> 39:28.280
an absolutely beautiful, almost impeccable cultural soil

39:28.280 --> 39:29.960
for what he is to do.

39:30.760 --> 39:35.760
And they have the wings of the party dynamic going on.

39:36.040 --> 39:39.160
I think they also have the ruler for life thing, right?

39:39.160 --> 39:41.680
Now, now, ruler for life.

39:41.680 --> 39:45.320
I mean, they don't fall from their position

39:45.320 --> 39:47.800
until the mandate of heaven takes them off of it, right?

39:47.800 --> 39:51.160
This is like BC, we're talking BC here, these precedencies.

39:51.160 --> 39:55.360
This is a culture that is, I mean, rich, in my opinion,

39:55.360 --> 39:57.880
rich and amazing to no end, to no end.

39:57.880 --> 39:58.960
I mean, the Tang dynasty.

39:58.960 --> 40:01.360
I mean, I'm so fascinated with the history of China.

40:01.360 --> 40:03.760
I'm not a big CCP fan, but China,

40:03.760 --> 40:06.360
I'm just like ravenously interested across the board.

40:06.360 --> 40:08.480
But many of these precedents are very early.

40:08.480 --> 40:11.160
And now they're wielding them and they're leveraging them

40:11.160 --> 40:13.040
in a way that really makes a lot of sense.

40:13.040 --> 40:16.320
And so Xi can think about a 20-year goal.

40:16.320 --> 40:18.320
Trump has gotta get elected, you know?

40:18.320 --> 40:19.680
He's gotta get elected.

40:19.680 --> 40:21.920
And whoever's after him has gotta get elected.

40:21.920 --> 40:26.440
For Xi, it's kind of like, he can set a 20-40 goal

40:26.440 --> 40:31.440
and he can genuinely take a hard swing at that, right?

40:31.520 --> 40:35.400
Deng Jinping was up there for Lord knows how long.

40:35.400 --> 40:37.600
What was he, 90 or something when he stepped down?

40:37.600 --> 40:40.920
It's a, so these guys can take a really good run at it.

40:40.920 --> 40:43.840
And that ability to think long-term, I think,

40:43.840 --> 40:45.880
puts us at a sincere disadvantage.

40:45.920 --> 40:50.040
So do you see, this is actually a very interesting point.

40:50.040 --> 40:54.440
Do you see the representative democracy as a system

40:54.440 --> 40:57.560
is a system worthy of being disrupted

40:57.560 --> 41:00.480
considering that your competitor is being driven

41:00.480 --> 41:02.680
on a centrally driven kind of a system?

41:02.680 --> 41:03.960
Which I also wanna add,

41:03.960 --> 41:06.840
this was something brought up in Joe Rogan podcast,

41:06.840 --> 41:09.000
as Salma mentioned, I keep bringing this up,

41:09.000 --> 41:11.160
that China is run by engineers,

41:11.160 --> 41:13.680
United States is run by lawyers.

41:13.680 --> 41:15.680
So there's a very big difference,

41:16.480 --> 41:17.640
not only implementing solutions,

41:17.640 --> 41:20.880
but also recognizing problems and solutions

41:20.880 --> 41:23.960
to be the most practical kind of solutions.

41:23.960 --> 41:27.320
And we seem to be stuck in this representative democracy

41:27.320 --> 41:29.200
and all the consequences of it.

41:31.120 --> 41:33.840
That question, I think it's,

41:33.840 --> 41:37.800
I would say this is an apt time to ask that question.

41:37.800 --> 41:40.560
I would also say it is beyond my pale

41:40.560 --> 41:42.560
to have firm and square opinions

41:42.560 --> 41:44.640
about the how of the reconstruction.

41:44.640 --> 41:45.840
Again, it's not my domain.

41:45.840 --> 41:48.440
I'll speak to things that I feel confident about

41:48.440 --> 41:49.800
and not so much ones I don't.

41:49.800 --> 41:51.240
But I do believe,

41:52.920 --> 41:55.080
I have reason to believe from my vantage point

41:55.080 --> 41:56.960
and my own experience of where I feel like

41:56.960 --> 41:59.160
I have expertise that's worthwhile to talk about

41:59.160 --> 42:01.480
that it's warranted to question it.

42:01.480 --> 42:03.760
Because some of these points,

42:03.760 --> 42:05.440
so the whole point of that seven weaknesses

42:05.440 --> 42:06.360
of the West article,

42:06.360 --> 42:08.280
and I have some other pieces coming out about China

42:08.280 --> 42:09.920
in the coming three or four months,

42:09.920 --> 42:11.560
particularly around media.

42:11.560 --> 42:12.400
That is to say,

42:12.400 --> 42:14.560
our media is essentially built to divide us

42:15.400 --> 42:16.840
and China gets free reign to come in however they want.

42:16.840 --> 42:18.120
Buy up the movie theaters,

42:18.120 --> 42:20.240
buy up the movie studios,

42:20.240 --> 42:22.120
we're all using TikTok, right?

42:22.120 --> 42:22.960
And what are they using?

42:22.960 --> 42:24.040
Google and Facebook?

42:24.040 --> 42:27.320
Nay, my comrade, nay, my comrade.

42:27.320 --> 42:29.480
So they get to mold this,

42:29.480 --> 42:31.000
what they would refer to as harmony,

42:31.000 --> 42:34.960
we might refer to as something more akin to obedience.

42:34.960 --> 42:37.200
Something more akin to like break your legs

42:37.200 --> 42:40.000
if you do the wrong kind of yoga in the park,

42:40.000 --> 42:40.840
Falun Gong.

42:42.160 --> 42:43.800
But they would call it harmony.

42:43.800 --> 42:45.520
So they were able to consciously mold that

42:45.520 --> 42:47.240
through the entirety of their digital ecosystems

42:47.240 --> 42:48.760
that were not a part of it.

42:48.760 --> 42:51.320
They can buy the movie theaters out, brother.

42:51.320 --> 42:55.200
They can buy the people who make the films out, brother.

42:55.200 --> 42:57.240
They can buy up the big gaming companies.

42:57.240 --> 42:58.080
You see Blizzard,

42:58.080 --> 43:01.400
you're not allowed to talk about Uyghurs on Blizzard, right?

43:01.400 --> 43:05.320
So media is its own ball of wax.

43:05.320 --> 43:08.600
But yeah, I would say given those present dynamics,

43:08.600 --> 43:09.840
there's someone I follow on Twitter

43:09.840 --> 43:11.360
whose name now completely evades me,

43:12.240 --> 43:15.480
who framed it very well, better than I had previously,

43:15.480 --> 43:17.560
is that there's a default momentum

43:17.560 --> 43:20.920
where we would then just follow and keep up with China

43:20.920 --> 43:23.160
in terms of control and media

43:23.160 --> 43:25.720
in order to make sure that we're not weaker than them.

43:25.720 --> 43:27.480
That that might be a natural momentum,

43:27.480 --> 43:28.680
which is dangerous, right?

43:28.680 --> 43:32.320
To be a follower and to also follow of anybody, Mao.

43:32.320 --> 43:35.040
I mean, if you're gonna give me one person to follow,

43:35.040 --> 43:37.120
I will give you a million human beings

43:37.120 --> 43:38.040
before I give you Mao.

43:38.040 --> 43:40.760
I will give you literally a million men,

43:40.960 --> 43:42.240
a million men or women.

43:42.240 --> 43:44.400
I'll give you Thatcher, I'll give you, name him.

43:44.400 --> 43:45.800
I'll give you Joan of Arc.

43:45.800 --> 43:48.320
I mean, I don't care, anybody but Mao.

43:48.320 --> 43:53.320
So I think that the default momentum is in that direction.

43:54.160 --> 43:57.000
We do have to think about what does it look like

43:57.000 --> 43:59.880
to maintain our strengths and our values

43:59.880 --> 44:02.120
while also dealing with the reality

44:02.120 --> 44:04.040
of the digital ecosystem that we exist in.

44:04.040 --> 44:06.360
And one of my big contentions with defense

44:06.360 --> 44:08.960
is that I think a tremendous amount of money

44:08.960 --> 44:10.560
goes into things that rust,

44:10.560 --> 44:12.720
that is to say tanks, et cetera, et cetera.

44:12.720 --> 44:15.120
While China, I think intelligently,

44:15.120 --> 44:17.400
is playing the economic and playing the digital

44:17.400 --> 44:20.360
and media game, which is much more plausibly deniable.

44:20.360 --> 44:21.320
And I think in the future

44:21.320 --> 44:23.880
will be a much bigger lever of influence.

44:23.880 --> 44:25.960
And so I think that they're playing smarter

44:25.960 --> 44:27.640
than we are in that domain.

44:27.640 --> 44:28.920
Very well said.

44:28.920 --> 44:31.320
Do you think it's corruption that takes more money

44:31.320 --> 44:34.560
towards the rustable things that you're talking about?

44:34.560 --> 44:36.880
Like they have lobbyists and contractors

44:36.880 --> 44:40.040
and connections with certain manufacturers.

44:40.040 --> 44:42.440
You know, I don't know enough

44:42.440 --> 44:47.440
about what is called the military industrial complex.

44:47.600 --> 44:48.920
I don't know it.

44:48.920 --> 44:50.760
In fact, I don't know enough

44:50.760 --> 44:53.840
to even have a firm opinion on that phrase.

44:54.960 --> 44:59.000
So I've spoken with folks in defense, writ large,

44:59.000 --> 45:00.840
I consider them to be good folks,

45:00.840 --> 45:04.560
but it wouldn't surprise me if there was all manner

45:04.560 --> 45:09.320
of dealings and whatnot that might be less than ideal

45:09.320 --> 45:11.440
and it might be kind of tainted incentives

45:11.440 --> 45:13.080
in many different regards.

45:14.080 --> 45:15.320
But I can't speak to it enough.

45:15.320 --> 45:16.600
I don't have enough experience.

45:16.600 --> 45:18.840
Is DARPA still the leading,

45:18.840 --> 45:21.960
I guess you can call them agency or department or whatever

45:21.960 --> 45:24.640
with respect to artificial intelligence?

45:24.640 --> 45:25.560
Yeah, you know, they still,

45:25.560 --> 45:27.600
they have so many different branches now.

45:27.600 --> 45:32.120
And I think what I am heartened by

45:32.120 --> 45:35.360
is that there are more of these efforts

45:35.360 --> 45:38.480
to improve public private sector partnership,

45:38.480 --> 45:39.920
really, really direct efforts.

45:39.920 --> 45:41.800
We did a very robust report

45:41.800 --> 45:45.080
about the all of the published AI strategy docs

45:45.080 --> 45:46.560
from the US public sector.

45:46.560 --> 45:49.520
So the AI.gov and all the permutations

45:49.520 --> 45:50.800
that are publicly available.

45:50.800 --> 45:51.800
What do they have in common?

45:51.800 --> 45:53.440
What are the common initiatives?

45:53.440 --> 45:55.880
A critical thrust across absolutely all of them

45:55.880 --> 45:58.200
is improving public private sector partnerships.

45:58.200 --> 46:00.360
And we see new organizations

46:00.440 --> 46:02.320
like it used to be called the DIUX.

46:02.320 --> 46:03.640
Now it's called the DIU.

46:03.640 --> 46:08.280
It's sort of another sort of investment venture wing.

46:08.280 --> 46:10.200
We have things like Incutel and DARPA

46:10.200 --> 46:11.040
that have been around forever.

46:11.040 --> 46:12.960
DARPA is obviously still a huge deal.

46:13.920 --> 46:16.000
But we also have similar little,

46:17.120 --> 46:19.680
we could call sort of like accelerator incubators

46:19.680 --> 46:21.720
slash venture arms of even the Air Force

46:21.720 --> 46:22.760
has their own shtick.

46:22.760 --> 46:24.880
They have a little camp that they run in Boston

46:24.880 --> 46:26.160
and a place that they rent out.

46:26.160 --> 46:27.280
And I think they make investments

46:27.280 --> 46:30.040
and work with tech talent and whatnot.

46:30.440 --> 46:33.400
So there's a spidering proliferation of these groups.

46:34.760 --> 46:36.560
I don't know enough about their coordination

46:36.560 --> 46:38.280
to say if I feel good about that.

46:38.280 --> 46:40.000
My inkling is it's not amazing

46:40.000 --> 46:42.520
because defense is very complicated.

46:42.520 --> 46:44.640
But yeah, DARPA still, I would say the best known

46:44.640 --> 46:46.600
to the best of my knowledge.

46:46.600 --> 46:48.960
But luckily it's proliferating.

46:48.960 --> 46:49.960
Excellent.

46:49.960 --> 46:52.520
Based on the data and understanding

46:52.520 --> 46:54.640
that you have gathered within these years,

46:54.640 --> 46:58.720
you must have some kind of end game kind of a picture

46:58.720 --> 47:02.280
for US AI supremacy and Chinese AI supremacy.

47:02.280 --> 47:04.200
Do you have something like that?

47:04.200 --> 47:05.960
I do, I've written an article on it.

47:05.960 --> 47:10.760
So what are some of the drastic contrast

47:10.760 --> 47:12.360
between those kind of words?

47:12.360 --> 47:17.040
The word where AI is driven by a US supremacy

47:17.040 --> 47:20.200
or the world that AI is driven by Chinese supremacy?

47:21.360 --> 47:24.120
Yeah, you know, I try my hardest

47:24.120 --> 47:27.480
to not think about that as my default frame.

47:27.520 --> 47:28.800
It's very hard not to

47:28.800 --> 47:30.680
because of the whole Thucydides trap

47:30.680 --> 47:34.440
and because of the level of tension

47:34.440 --> 47:36.200
that we're dealing with right now.

47:37.600 --> 47:40.920
But in my heart of hearts as a first swing,

47:40.920 --> 47:43.640
I have an article called We Unite or We Fight,

47:43.640 --> 47:47.480
so E-M-E-R-J, We Unite or We Fight,

47:47.480 --> 47:50.120
which is really around getting on the same page.

47:51.200 --> 47:53.320
It's a horrible word, but same-pagedness,

47:53.320 --> 47:54.920
we could call it solidarity,

47:54.920 --> 47:58.840
around what kind of 10-year, 20-year,

47:58.840 --> 48:03.280
even maybe longer, visions we want for a global society

48:03.280 --> 48:05.600
and being able to somewhere agree on that,

48:05.600 --> 48:09.680
to align and have transparency and steering,

48:09.680 --> 48:11.080
shared transparency and steering

48:11.080 --> 48:14.680
around where the big trajectory actually goes.

48:14.680 --> 48:17.920
That said, I'm not necessarily an optimist

48:17.920 --> 48:21.560
to that same-pagedness between China as it stands today

48:21.560 --> 48:24.520
and the US is really all that possible.

48:24.560 --> 48:27.880
If China had the government of Japan, for example,

48:29.800 --> 48:33.840
I probably really wouldn't be all that democratic nation.

48:33.840 --> 48:35.760
I mean, I just don't really think

48:35.760 --> 48:38.880
there's gonna be that many problems with that.

48:38.880 --> 48:42.080
I mean, Japan's a different ballgame than us,

48:42.080 --> 48:45.800
but democracy-wise, and people are people,

48:45.800 --> 48:48.080
there's no issues with individual Chinese folks

48:48.080 --> 48:52.560
by any means, but yeah, I feel as though

48:52.560 --> 48:54.600
the kind of global solidarity and alignment

48:54.600 --> 48:56.480
that would be required to get on the same page

48:56.480 --> 48:58.480
about what are we to turn into,

48:58.480 --> 49:00.120
what is the human experience to be,

49:00.120 --> 49:02.560
what is the global community to bloom into

49:02.560 --> 49:04.000
beyond the present human experience,

49:04.000 --> 49:05.960
because we're not really gonna be able to stop that train,

49:05.960 --> 49:07.120
hopefully we can guide it,

49:07.120 --> 49:08.680
hopefully it can be something other than war

49:08.680 --> 49:10.640
that drives it forward.

49:10.640 --> 49:14.600
So that article articulates what my hoped vision would be,

49:14.600 --> 49:17.640
which is not war, which is solidarity,

49:18.800 --> 49:21.000
but I'll tell you, to get to that solidarity,

49:22.720 --> 49:24.920
that's, there's gotta be a smarter guy than me for that one.

49:24.920 --> 49:28.200
Sometimes just parts come from different kind of

49:28.200 --> 49:29.880
experience and background.

49:29.880 --> 49:32.320
It's been true with certain religions that

49:33.440 --> 49:36.200
some religions, they just do not wanna get along

49:36.200 --> 49:38.520
with other religions or other competitors.

49:38.520 --> 49:39.960
They demand submission.

49:39.960 --> 49:41.240
That's what they're demanding.

49:41.240 --> 49:44.760
However, we fool ourselves in this part of the world.

49:44.760 --> 49:49.360
That doesn't change their status quo and default state.

49:49.360 --> 49:52.520
So it seems like there is a fundamental disconnect

49:53.480 --> 49:55.000
between the Chinese Communist Party,

49:55.000 --> 49:58.320
and I'm not dividing based on good and bad

49:58.320 --> 50:02.400
or any kind of ethical or moral judgment,

50:02.400 --> 50:05.320
but they're just coming from a very different kind of a place

50:05.320 --> 50:08.000
and looking for a very different kind of an outcome

50:08.000 --> 50:10.400
than the United States.

50:11.800 --> 50:14.000
I think that is certainly the case.

50:14.880 --> 50:17.560
What I will say about the United States,

50:17.560 --> 50:21.160
as absolutely horrible as I think we're doing right now

50:21.160 --> 50:23.480
on the global stage from Trump to you name it.

50:23.480 --> 50:28.480
I mean, as just brutal as our perception is globally,

50:28.640 --> 50:31.720
our value prop is, it ain't that bad.

50:31.720 --> 50:33.040
It ain't that bad, man.

50:33.040 --> 50:37.400
I mean, there's a lot of countries that dig our value prop

50:37.400 --> 50:40.000
more than whatever they were rocking with

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
before they had it.

50:41.000 --> 50:44.360
And I'm now, am I advocating for colonial,

50:44.360 --> 50:45.960
not even freaking close, right?

50:45.960 --> 50:47.360
But somebody would misinterpret that

50:47.360 --> 50:50.520
because that's the world we live in right now.

50:50.520 --> 50:53.280
What I will say is that just as a culture,

50:53.280 --> 50:55.840
the general value prop I think is really strong.

50:55.840 --> 50:58.360
It's very hard for China to,

50:58.360 --> 51:02.000
so I believe there's a permutation of a Machiavelli quote,

51:02.000 --> 51:04.320
something akin to, and this might be bastardized

51:04.320 --> 51:06.320
and I apologize, but something akin to,

51:06.320 --> 51:11.320
when you take over a country or a county or what have you,

51:11.320 --> 51:13.920
you have the choice to let them keep their arms

51:13.920 --> 51:16.000
or to take away their arms.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.920
But you can't let them keep their arms

51:17.920 --> 51:20.160
and then later take away their arms.

51:20.160 --> 51:22.880
And I think that when it comes to China

51:22.880 --> 51:26.680
selling their value proposition to other countries,

51:26.680 --> 51:29.560
those countries would have to be at brutal war

51:29.560 --> 51:31.240
with each other for a very long time

51:31.240 --> 51:34.200
and essentially lose all semblance of a stable democracy

51:34.200 --> 51:38.760
before you would say yay to the kind of vulgar tyranny

51:38.760 --> 51:41.040
of the Chinese Communist Party.

51:41.960 --> 51:46.400
And so I think that the sale of their schtick

51:46.400 --> 51:47.880
is a tougher sell.

51:47.880 --> 51:51.360
And so if we have nothing else going for us in the States,

51:52.280 --> 51:55.560
it would be that you can tweet what you want,

51:55.560 --> 52:00.120
including about the man who purportedly runs the country

52:00.120 --> 52:02.720
and you're gonna go to bed just fine.

52:02.720 --> 52:04.680
Yeah, the fundamental American values,

52:04.680 --> 52:09.120
there I say constitutional values, absolutely.

52:09.120 --> 52:13.560
Dare you say, yeah, you're a Bible thumper, aren't you?

52:13.560 --> 52:15.760
Must be, and white supremacists, I guess.

52:17.920 --> 52:21.240
Anyway, but yes, I just think about them as,

52:21.240 --> 52:23.920
in the OECD, I have a great,

52:23.920 --> 52:28.840
I have a really warm and abiding respect

52:28.840 --> 52:31.360
for the OECD as an organization.

52:31.360 --> 52:34.400
I really recommend people interested in solidarity,

52:34.400 --> 52:36.440
certainly in sort of the broad Western dynamic

52:36.440 --> 52:39.200
versus the hardcore communism

52:39.200 --> 52:41.040
to learn more about the OECD,

52:41.040 --> 52:43.680
but they refer to it as like-minded nations, right?

52:43.680 --> 52:45.480
It's not any one person's constitution.

52:45.480 --> 52:47.160
It's just, can you say what you want

52:47.160 --> 52:48.400
and nobody breaks your legs?

52:48.400 --> 52:50.760
Can you pray to what you want and nobody breaks your legs?

52:50.760 --> 52:52.720
Can you come together and congregate how you want

52:52.720 --> 52:54.080
and nobody breaks your legs?

52:54.080 --> 52:57.040
It's just basic stuff, it's just basic stuff.

52:57.040 --> 52:58.360
So for me, it's not even constitutional,

52:58.360 --> 52:59.960
it's just like-minded nations

52:59.960 --> 53:03.600
where somewhat essential sort of freedoms,

53:03.600 --> 53:06.400
as far back as Greece or we wanna tie to John Locke

53:06.400 --> 53:08.320
or I don't really care who gets the credit,

53:08.320 --> 53:10.600
just the kinds of freedoms that we enjoy, right?

53:10.600 --> 53:13.040
So I can extrapolate it even beyond the constitution

53:13.040 --> 53:13.920
if we wanted to.

53:13.920 --> 53:15.120
Yeah, interesting.

53:15.120 --> 53:18.680
Transparency is the key, definitely.

53:18.680 --> 53:21.120
Are you at all confident and optimistic

53:21.120 --> 53:24.600
about decentralization on the basis of blockchain

53:24.600 --> 53:26.200
to reach some of these goals?

53:30.200 --> 53:33.400
I don't know enough about blockchain

53:33.400 --> 53:35.760
to have a square opinion there.

53:35.760 --> 53:37.520
What I will tell you is this,

53:37.520 --> 53:40.240
there appears to be very little blockchain

53:40.240 --> 53:44.320
tinkering its way into the actual enterprise right now.

53:44.320 --> 53:45.840
Now, the same could be said of AI,

53:45.840 --> 53:48.960
but AI is much farther along in let's say big banks,

53:48.960 --> 53:53.360
big media companies, e-commerce, manufacturing.

53:53.360 --> 53:56.400
Artificial intelligence is eking its way in in the corners.

53:56.400 --> 53:58.760
I'm not saying it's easy and at a fun time,

53:58.760 --> 53:59.920
but it's making a difference.

53:59.920 --> 54:01.880
It's clearly going to be transformative.

54:01.880 --> 54:03.920
Blockchain, I don't think that the use cases

54:03.920 --> 54:06.080
are so nascent that I really don't have firm opinions.

54:06.080 --> 54:08.000
When I look at the intersection of blockchain and AI,

54:08.000 --> 54:09.640
which I have done some research on,

54:12.560 --> 54:13.560
it's nascent to the point

54:13.560 --> 54:15.400
where I literally don't care about it yet.

54:15.400 --> 54:17.960
I mean, didn't you talk about that with Ben Gertzell?

54:17.960 --> 54:20.400
Because Ben Gertzell's Singularity Net is-

54:20.400 --> 54:23.720
And I have a tremendous respect for Gertzell, by the way.

54:23.720 --> 54:26.960
I mean, I consider Gertzell, in my personal opinion,

54:26.960 --> 54:30.240
he's one of probably four living intellectuals

54:30.240 --> 54:33.360
who I would say have really influenced my thought

54:33.400 --> 54:38.120
and who I consider to be toweringly intelligent.

54:38.120 --> 54:41.200
And so I have a great respect for Gertzell.

54:41.200 --> 54:44.360
But yeah, I mean, and I hope his firm succeeds.

54:44.360 --> 54:45.200
I'm rooting for him.

54:45.200 --> 54:46.480
I'm rooting for Singularity Net.

54:46.480 --> 54:49.920
It still seems to me to be a great many different ideas

54:49.920 --> 54:51.760
that they're exploring in terms of what the business model

54:51.760 --> 54:53.040
will be and how it's going to work out.

54:53.040 --> 54:55.280
And if anybody can do it, hopefully it's him.

54:55.280 --> 54:56.120
But I think-

54:56.120 --> 54:57.120
Yeah, what can lead to AGI?

54:57.120 --> 54:59.320
That's the thing, because we don't really know

54:59.320 --> 55:02.080
what can lead to AGI at this point.

55:02.080 --> 55:02.960
That's exactly it.

55:03.520 --> 55:04.360
Yeah, we don't have a clue yet.

55:04.360 --> 55:06.000
So Ben's got some theories, though,

55:06.000 --> 55:08.360
and he's got more informed theories than me.

55:08.360 --> 55:10.200
He's been thinking about it since I was five years old.

55:10.200 --> 55:11.840
Fascinating, fascinating individual.

55:13.480 --> 55:16.840
We talked about having an hour long conversation,

55:16.840 --> 55:18.560
so I don't wanna leak.

55:18.560 --> 55:20.360
Yeah, you have a two o'clock, unfortunately.

55:20.360 --> 55:21.200
Okay.

55:21.200 --> 55:22.040
I'm gonna blast with you.

55:22.040 --> 55:22.860
It's been a real fun day.

55:22.860 --> 55:23.700
Yeah, man.

55:23.700 --> 55:26.000
Dan's website is emerge.com.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.280
Go there and find all the other information.

55:28.280 --> 55:31.800
Let me ask you the last question I ask all my guests.

55:31.800 --> 55:34.040
That if you come across an intelligent alien

55:34.040 --> 55:35.520
from a different civilization,

55:35.520 --> 55:39.080
what would you say is the worst thing humanity has done?

55:39.080 --> 55:41.680
And what would you say is our greatest achievement?

55:43.400 --> 55:44.520
Good gracious, brother.

55:44.520 --> 55:45.800
I have no idea.

55:45.800 --> 55:47.600
What is the worst thing we've done?

55:48.720 --> 55:53.600
Well, I mean, tribal and religious wars seem pretty rough.

55:53.600 --> 55:54.760
That's a very big umbrella.

55:54.760 --> 55:56.620
I apologize for the vagary there.

55:57.920 --> 56:01.280
And in terms of the best things that we've done,

56:01.640 --> 56:06.640
I think it's determined ways to both govern ourselves

56:07.080 --> 56:09.320
and progress forward in terms of our potential

56:09.320 --> 56:13.360
at the same time with reasonable periods of peace.

56:13.360 --> 56:14.880
I think that that's a worthy,

56:14.880 --> 56:19.000
it's a laudable achievement for hairless apes like ourselves.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.520
And I think we can deserve a pat on the back for that one.

56:21.520 --> 56:23.360
I think that's a worthy achievement for hairless apes like ourselves.

56:51.520 --> 56:52.760
I think that's a worthy achievement for hairless apes like ourselves.
