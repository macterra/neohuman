1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
Really, the big thing that has kind of been a part of my thinking for a long time and

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:12,320
something I put in the book pretty prominently is how do we build a better government that

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,760
doesn't do the things that we have going on today?

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,180
How did the ancient people build their governments?

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,640
Because they had to figure it out somehow.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,600
What was the organizational principle?

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,360
What were they doing when they were establishing the Athenian Senate?

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,920
What was the impetus that made them do this and create these institutions?

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:43,240
I think the psychedelic drugs are a big part of that.

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,600
Adam Dresche, welcome to Neo Human Podcast, episode 93.

11
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,600
93, huh?

12
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,600
All right, sweet.

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,600
Thanks for having me.

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,600
I appreciate it, bro.

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,200
What does that number mean to you?

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:59,680
Because you're kind of a person who looks a little deeper into things than general public.

17
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,640
Yeah, no numerology on my side.

18
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:11,160
Adam actually reached me on Twitter after the interview with Jason Giorgiani.

19
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,160
Yeah.

20
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,160
That was a great interview.

21
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,160
I really enjoyed that.

22
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,160
Thanks, man.

23
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,080
It's always a pleasure talking to him.

24
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,000
You mentioned your book, which we're definitely going to talk about today.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,560
It's called Eden and Entheogens, Psychedelic History from the Bronze Age to the 1960s.

26
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,040
This is a book that is available for free.

27
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,840
I believe that this is a result of 10-year long research, as you mentioned.

28
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,840
Yeah.

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,680
I've been kind of working on it.

30
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,720
I've been serious about it for the past year or two.

31
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,120
I spent about 10 years on it.

32
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,120
All right.

33
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,120
We've got to get to all of that, but let's start with your background.

34
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,400
The lives you live, the work you've done, and what are you mainly focused on now these

35
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
days?

36
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,400
Right.

37
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,400
Yeah.

38
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:07,640
So basically, I kind of grew up in a pretty Christian conservative community.

39
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,880
Went to a Lutheran school, my home state here in Minnesota.

40
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,120
That's kind of like what introduced me to the Bible and kind of got me curious about

41
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,880
biblical stories.

42
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:26,800
Grew up and then actually went to an art school, so that kind of went the other way.

43
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,400
Basically I studied music for a while.

44
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,920
After graduating from art school, I was just kind of disaffected with just a lot of things

45
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:44,320
in society and a lot of things that I just didn't agree with about the way our country

46
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,720
is kind of going.

47
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,000
I kind of became more conservative after graduating from art school and I've been kind of back

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,640
and forth between the two.

49
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,560
That's kind of like my educational background, I guess.

50
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,000
Then since then, it's basically been, I just kind of do a lot of reading and a lot of research

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
on my own time.

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,840
I'm kind of independent, so I don't have a publisher.

53
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:18,840
I published my book independently on the Internet Archive.

54
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,880
Basically I do things myself, pretty much.

55
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:28,680
I work odd jobs and do stuff like that, so yeah, that's kind of my background, I guess.

56
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,520
What year was it that you graduated from art school?

57
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,520
That was in 2010.

58
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,520
2010?

59
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,520
Yep.

60
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:42,000
I think that period is a period of red pilling for a lot of people and awakening for a lot

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
of people.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I mean, Bitcoin came in 2008 and then 2012, 2013 seems like a lot of people began to waken

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,120
up to seeing outside of this matrix because this is what it is.

64
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,120
Totally.

65
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,120
Yeah.

66
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:02,880
I mean, Alex Jones was definitely part of my waking up journey for sure, because he was

67
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,200
just an animated guy and it was just so bizarre.

68
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,400
I just thought he was such an interesting dude.

69
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,400
Yeah.

70
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,160
There's a meme factory, walking meme factory.

71
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,160
Totally.

72
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,160
Yeah, totally.

73
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,720
Well, I found it interesting.

74
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:24,520
You shared a meme with me earlier today, kind of paving the way for this interview.

75
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,800
Basically I was thinking about how I can describe it to people who are listening and not watching

76
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
it.

77
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,120
It doesn't need to be described, you know, it related meaning that you were basically

78
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,440
surprised that somebody would say that, yeah, bro, come and talk about your book on my podcast.

79
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,440
When are you ready?

80
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,440
Right.

81
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,440
Yeah, exactly.

82
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,440
Yeah.

83
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:48,360
So, yeah, because I reach out to a lot of people and I see, you know, I just kind of throw

84
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,360
it out there.

85
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,360
I'm like, look, I wrote this book.

86
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,240
It's kind of working with Terrence McKenna's ideas.

87
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,960
You might be interested in this and so I don't hear back from a lot of people basically,

88
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,240
but you know, I send it out there at least just to put it out there.

89
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,280
So when I do get a response, I'm always just like super excited about it because I think,

90
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,600
I don't know, I just think Terrence McKenna is a little bit like under regarded as a kind

91
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,520
of, I mean, as a serious thinker.

92
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,920
I think, you know, he's kind of in kind of meme territory right now in the kind of popular

93
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,920
culture.

94
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,340
I mean, he does have some kind of like, you know, he gets some accolades from people like

95
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,760
Rogan and stuff, which is good.

96
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,040
But I just think there's more to kind of dig into about like things that he said and kind

97
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,640
of his line of thinking, I think is super relevant about getting to like a very originalist

98
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,000
idea of, you know, where do human beings come from?

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,160
What is that kind of natural state of government for us?

100
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,440
And you know, even a natural state of religion, perhaps, that he kind of touches on that,

101
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,680
I think in Food of the Gods and some other books.

102
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:56,280
And you know, he's definitely kind of a part of that 1960s milieu and that cultural kind

103
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,120
of Renaissance that happened.

104
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,200
And I just, I think that, you know, more of that I think would be very beneficial for

105
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,360
American culture because I think you have, you have right now, you have people kind of

106
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,800
being kind of divided off into these kind of party groups.

107
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:19,240
And it's just that real like spirit of common good that was kind of alive in the 60s and

108
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,320
that Terrence McKenna kind of worked with and built off of, seems to me to be something

109
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,920
that, you know, we can learn a lot from.

110
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,560
And so that's one reason why I respect Terrence a lot and also because just the content of

111
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,360
his books I think are really interesting.

112
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,960
Yeah, the description of your book on your Twitter is that they discovered the relationship

113
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,280
between Stone-Dape theory and the Bible with my new book, Eden and Inclusion is now available

114
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,500
free of charge on the Internet Archive.

115
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,920
So let's get right to it.

116
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,880
First of all, what inspired you to begin this research into psychedelics and Bible?

117
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,760
You mentioned that you got interested in Bible as a child.

118
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,720
I kind of share that kind of interest in religion.

119
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,600
I grew up in Iran and I had, I had few years of getting really into Shiism, but in the

120
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:10,280
mystical part of it, you know, just the whole feeling and atmosphere around it, you know,

121
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,880
you don't even care whether or not the stories are true.

122
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,880
Yeah, right.

123
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,120
There's, yeah, there's kind of, yeah, there's a romance to these religions, I think, in

124
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
a way.

125
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,320
There's a very romantic vision of these religions.

126
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,160
And yeah, I don't know if you were part of the Sufi schools at all, but yeah, I'm kind

127
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
of interested.

128
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,560
I've had Sufi friends, they've been around, but you know, Iran, because of the kind of

129
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,760
theocracy that they have, a total monopoly, no one else basically has the right to express

130
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:46,200
themselves except a very small circle of Shia clerics and the militants who are, you know,

131
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,840
might very well be the next, the future of that country.

132
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,840
Right.

133
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,840
Yeah, I mean, yeah, you don't know.

134
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,000
I mean, it's kind of chaos over there.

135
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah.

136
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,920
But you know, it's human nature because what happened there can very well happens here.

137
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,720
Oh, yeah, totally.

138
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,720
100%.

139
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,800
I mean, yeah, I mean, actually, I do have a kind of Islamic background too, which I

140
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
didn't really touch on.

141
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,120
Yeah, my dad's from Morocco, actually.

142
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,280
So yeah, so he kind of comes from a Muslim family.

143
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,080
He's not so much Muslim himself.

144
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,800
He kind of came over to the United States to kind of get away from the Islamic world,

145
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,120
so to speak.

146
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,320
And yeah, so, you know, he's pretty new age, I guess, my dad in his own way, but he's still

147
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,120
also very traditional.

148
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:33,900
So yeah, so I mean, so yeah, I kind of, I'm very interested in the Islamic world too.

149
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,280
Not just like the biblical kind of Christian Jewish stories, but the Islamic stories, I

150
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,720
mean, they're all very interconnected, interrelated to a large extent.

151
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:49,100
And I see potential for de-escalation of conflict between these religions in kind of developing

152
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,600
a unified kind of framework of how to interpret them.

153
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,880
And one way that I do that is with Terrence McKenna and by identifying areas in the Bible

154
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:05,280
and areas in Islam as well, where you have evidence of hallucinogenic drug use.

155
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:12,000
And it's very, it's a very interesting kind of argument to make, because it kind of undermines

156
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,560
a lot of the kind of authoritarian versions of these religions today.

157
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,440
When you can point to places in the Bible that like, it's almost obvious that these

158
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,800
people are using hallucinogenic drugs.

159
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,880
This is what real fundamentalism looks like.

160
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,480
It looks like Woodstock in the 1960s, and we can get into some of those stories and

161
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,920
examples if you want to.

162
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,640
But it's really, it's an interesting way of looking at the Bible to say, you know, you

163
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,960
go back to the Bronze Age in the time of King David, you know, close to 1000 BC.

164
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:48,280
I mean, it's not like, you know, Judaism today, you know, in Israel or, you know, in the United

165
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,740
States, it's nothing like that.

166
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,620
It's a war cult.

167
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:59,240
When they're taking drugs, they're kind of have this very ecstatic sense of music.

168
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:04,680
And that's a big part of their temple worship is this music thing going on.

169
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,400
David was a songwriter himself.

170
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,600
The Psalms are supposedly written by King David.

171
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:16,040
So you have this really interesting psychedelic culture that is just obvious to anybody who

172
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,920
reads it through the eyes of like the 1960s.

173
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,240
You can just see very clearly these people are very different.

174
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,080
They venerate sex and fertility.

175
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:29,600
It's like, so they're coming out of this very archaic religion and culture that was centered

176
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,920
around, I mean, drug sex and rock and roll.

177
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,480
I mean, it's kind of the way that you can frame it.

178
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,480
And I think it's funny to look at it this way in a certain way.

179
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,040
But it's also, I mean, it's a serious argument too.

180
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,080
So that's kind of how I frame and set up my scholarship.

181
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,120
And it's just become more and more apparent to me the more I've looked at it.

182
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,240
Like this is really kind of the best way to interpret what these religions are about and

183
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,880
what they were really like in the early days.

184
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,200
It's different now because the traditions get passed down.

185
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,460
People stop taking the hallucinogens.

186
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:06,760
There's new rules invented and made up over the years and you get these dogmatic kind

187
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,680
of monoliths of these religions.

188
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:16,120
But going back and doing that examination of the earliest form I think is very helpful

189
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:22,560
for maybe not necessarily reviving a kind of archaic Abrahamic religion, but maybe even

190
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,160
just imagining what a new religion would look like.

191
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,600
Because these people invented these religions back then.

192
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,000
They were invented by people like Moses and Jesus and according to the biblical scriptures.

193
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,720
Some people say Jesus might not be real, Moses might not be real, but I mean, yeah.

194
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,240
I picked a couple of books to also mention throughout this conversation.

195
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,400
One of them is The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross by John Alec Rose, Study of the Nature

196
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,480
and the Origin of Christianity within the Fertility Cult of Ancient Near East.

197
00:11:52,480 --> 00:12:00,100
He argues Jesus was a mushroom and people were taking him and having these experiences.

198
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:07,120
Is that really weirder than believing the status quo story of Jesus or believing the

199
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,840
status quo story of, for example, Scientology?

200
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,240
Because anybody who has had any kind of a psychedelic experience can be like, yeah,

201
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,240
I totally get it.

202
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,880
I totally get how you can't have religious experiences on psychedelics.

203
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,880
Precisely.

204
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,320
I mean, yeah.

205
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,440
In all the other world religions, I mean, you can kind of see in paganism, in South

206
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:34,400
American shamanism, you see this use of these kind of plant drugs for this purpose.

207
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,480
It makes sense that we'd find this in the indigenous traditions in the Middle East as

208
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,480
well.

209
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,880
It just makes sense that that's what you'd find there.

210
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,680
For me, I mean, that's what I've seen.

211
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,520
The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross is very interesting.

212
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,920
I do have a piece about that book in my book as well.

213
00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:01,040
Basically, I have a minor dispute with Allegro and R. Gordon Wasson.

214
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,600
They kind of hyper-focused on a particular mushroom, the Amanita mushrooms, if you're

215
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,600
familiar.

216
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,440
They're red mushrooms with those white spots on them.

217
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,480
They're kind of associated with Santa Claus and kind of Northern European, kind of pagan.

218
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,360
I was going to say, a very significant role in culture all across basically.

219
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,360
Yeah, right, right.

220
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,880
It's kind of a European mushroom that Europeans are very familiar with.

221
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,320
When you get these European scholars going to the Middle East and looking at the Dead

222
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,600
Sea Scrolls, looking at these things, what they end up doing is they kind of associate

223
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,160
it to a mushroom that they're familiar with, which is the Amanitas, because that's kind

224
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,680
of common in their kind of cultural milieu.

225
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,360
There's some other reasons that I get to in my book.

226
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,480
You can read it if you want to dive in there.

227
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,360
Basically, scholars didn't really recognize that psilocybin mushrooms were present in

228
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,360
the Middle East for a long time.

229
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,000
They thought it was a South American thing.

230
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,680
All through the 50s, 60s, 70s, since Gordon Wasson went to South America, they thought,

231
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,280
okay, these are South American mushrooms.

232
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,720
They're different, but actually, they're all over.

233
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,440
They're in India, they're in Indonesia, they're all over the place because these spores can

234
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,200
just travel.

235
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:20,480
It's very likely that the mushrooms talked about in the ancient Jewish and the ancient

236
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,000
Christian tradition might actually... They might have had Amanitas, but they might have

237
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,600
also had psilocybin mushrooms as well.

238
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,720
There's probably allusions to opium in various places as well.

239
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,600
There's this big kind of drug concoction actually that was relevant to that region and to that

240
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,720
area at that time.

241
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,600
That's my one dispute I have with Allegro.

242
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,720
Jesus is very interesting.

243
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,540
The whole notion that Jesus was a mushroom, I think that Allegro gets this from the book

244
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:57,320
of John in the New Testament because basically what Jesus says is he says, I am the manna

245
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,800
of the ancient Israelites.

246
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,360
The manna is like this weird thing that comes out of a fog and it grows in the wilderness

247
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:10,840
and it feeds the Israelites for 40 years and it basically tests their faith is what it

248
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,200
says in the Old Testament.

249
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,040
The manna was this weird religious sacraments that came out of a cloud of fog and that's

250
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,760
really interesting because well, that's actually the conditions that are necessary for growing

251
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:26,440
psilocybin mushrooms if you're in a warm moist climate.

252
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:33,480
They really do a lot to identify that basically all the environmental conditions around them

253
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,000
were suitable for growing mushrooms.

254
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:43,160
When you read through Exodus 16, I do a really detailed analysis of this in my book.

255
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,280
You probably have this, so Jesus saying, I am the manna, I am the mushrooms that the

256
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:54,240
ancient Israelites used to eat in the wilderness, in some way I think he's actually tripped

257
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,240
out on drugs.

258
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,080
This is a real recording of something that he actually said.

259
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:04,000
I think he's like trying to explain his trip in some way and he's just losing his mind.

260
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,320
That's kind of the way that I frame it.

261
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,520
A lot of New Testament is like that.

262
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,520
Yes, exactly.

263
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,520
Yeah.

264
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:15,320
It's just like, and that's what these mystery traditions were, like the mystery schools

265
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:20,980
in the ancient world where these kind of processes and these banquets where you would go and

266
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,600
take psychedelics with a group of people and there'd be some kind of theatrical performance

267
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,800
of some kind where somebody would give some kind of like rhetorical sermon or speech.

268
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:36,560
It was meant to communicate like secret information about what was going on and kind of this occult

269
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,040
kind of form of communication.

270
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,840
It seems that Jesus was doing something like that.

271
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,160
He was kind of personifying in some way.

272
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:48,140
He's saying, I am the mushroom, you have to eat of my flesh, you have to drink my blood.

273
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,600
It's like speaking as if he is a mushroom, if that makes sense.

274
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Yeah.

275
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:59,260
I don't think it necessarily negates the possibility that Jesus was a historical person.

276
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:08,440
On your last episode with Jason, you guys brought up Apollonius of Tiana, maybe is what

277
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,440
it is.

278
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,440
Yes, I believe so.

279
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,440
Yeah.

280
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:17,600
So yeah, possibly it was a syncretism between multiple personalities compiled into the Bible.

281
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,780
The New Testament, in my opinion, is like the least historically credible of the three

282
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:27,760
Abrahamic religions because it's produced by the Roman Empire, which was persecuting

283
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,540
these rebellious Jews basically that Jesus was kind of intermixed with.

284
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:38,160
So the credibility of the New Testament to me is the most suspect as a historical document.

285
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,520
The Old Testament and Islamic literature, I think, are more credible.

286
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:48,000
So I kind of focus more on that as far as my thinking is concerned.

287
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Yeah.

288
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,320
Islam has this forever sword basically on top of Koran that anybody that changes a single

289
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,200
vow, that's basically a crime and it's the biggest sin you can commit.

290
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:09,960
So it has stayed the way it has stayed after I think the third Khalif who took power after

291
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,600
the prophet, basically because there were different versions of Koran, he gathered all

292
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:20,920
of them, burned all of them and there was one that had remained as it is right now.

293
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,440
Since you mentioned Jesus and what we were talking about, Jesus and psychedelics and

294
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:32,200
all that, there's also a claim that Moses was high on DMT when he saw the burning bush.

295
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,860
The problem is that, let me mention this also, that in Iran a religious authority has considered

296
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:45,040
a psychedelic to be medicine and said that it's halal as one of the clerics.

297
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:51,400
But you can totally see why there is a push all across in order to keep psychedelics away

298
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:57,680
from individuals because there's a huge difference if you're even going to read the Bible, even

299
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:03,800
going to read the New Testament, when you're experiencing some kind of a psychedelic state

300
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:08,240
rather than every Sunday go to church and this is the outcome of it that more and more

301
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,880
people are turned off by it.

302
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:16,120
I have thousands of channels and you cannot catch up with that because I'm not going to

303
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,280
get my morality from you because there are other people who are more famous than you

304
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,000
and I look up to them.

305
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,200
People have lost belief because you can't really force people to believe in something

306
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,920
that they cannot experience.

307
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:33,120
And I think this monopolization of experience is the biggest crime that has done to humanity

308
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,080
that hey, you believe in Jesus, you believe in New Testament, go and read it but have

309
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,400
the kind of an experience that will take you out of this frame that you call self, that

310
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,200
you identify with, right?

311
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,040
Yeah, definitely.

312
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:56,680
I agree with those sentiments that the church today is not even what it was a hundred years

313
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,680
ago.

314
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,440
I mean, it's totally different.

315
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,720
They could probably say that for all three of the Abrahamic religions.

316
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,600
With technology, with these new personalities, these new leadership figures in our society

317
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,960
and our culture and the direction of our culture, which is gravitating more towards personal

318
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,360
experience and probably, I mean, really psychedelic drugs.

319
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:26,400
I see this happening almost everywhere I look.

320
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,520
These forms don't apply to this kind of paradigm in a big way.

321
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,240
What you're saying about how people have other authorities and other leaders that they can

322
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,360
look to outside of the church that seem to be more credible.

323
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:47,580
I think of Joe Rogan and Terrence McKenna even as kind of classical religious figures

324
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,920
in a way because one, they take psychedelics, right?

325
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:57,240
So they have had that real personal experience with some kind of divinity.

326
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:06,920
Also because they kind of frame things, they intellectually frame things and communicate,

327
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:14,320
and that's really a big part of what the church did and has done for thousands of years is

328
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:21,380
framing the current political events and goings on and happenings in any empire and trying

329
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:29,720
to help direct the course of action of a community in some way and creating a narrative.

330
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,840
It worked out good in some cases.

331
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:39,440
For example, the Protestant churches in the early colonial American states, the Protestant

332
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,160
churches preached out against the British empire and these authoritarian systems of

333
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,200
control.

334
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,280
So there are some cases where the church really kind of served its purpose in a meaningful

335
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,840
capacity, but it seems you could make arguments, I think, both ways.

336
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,960
There are some areas where the church is kind of really trying to step up and kind of get

337
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:05,600
some level of justice for at least for conservative people in American society today.

338
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,600
But I think that they're not really totally doing enough because I think it's very surface

339
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,280
level appeals to religion and there is not a really deep appeal to what the core of religion

340
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,280
is.

341
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,720
In order to get there, you have to include some kind of conversation about these psychedelics

342
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:28,280
because it's always been part of this despite the fact that it's been swept under the rug

343
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,640
to a large extent and at least that's my view on it.

344
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,120
Yeah, I agree and they're not going to go away.

345
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,720
They've been around much longer than we have been.

346
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,040
We've talked about Stoned Ape Theory a couple of times on this podcast.

347
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:52,040
You make the connection between Stoned Ape Theory and creation of religions, which basically

348
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:57,160
can be extended into creation of cultures and societies because all of these have been

349
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:05,320
built in one way or another on religious foundations, especially in Western, modern day Western

350
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,960
kind of society that we're talking about.

351
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,440
The Stoned Ape Theory, for those who don't know, is a theory that human brain, correct

352
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,900
me if I'm wrong, human brain evolve faster than the rest of our body and the main reason

353
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:26,720
for that is that we start munching on psychedelics basically and have those kind of experiences.

354
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,720
It's a theory by Terence McKenna.

355
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,800
It's a sensible theory if you think about it.

356
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:37,180
Now you can expand from that that maybe psychedelics have been planted here by some other species

357
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:41,800
or extraterrestrial and anything is a possibility, right?

358
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:48,160
But what is the connection from the point that we start munching on psychedelics until

359
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:54,880
we're creating a concept of God, that there is a higher authority.

360
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,760
Based on my knowledge, the oldest that I know of, the evidence of it was found in this cave

361
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:05,080
in France that was made into a documentary, Cave of Forgotten Dreams, I think, by Werner

362
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,080
Herzog.

363
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:13,520
It's like 30,000, 35,000 years ago and they found the first symbology of people worshiping

364
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,280
some kind of a higher authority.

365
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,520
Right.

366
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,200
It's an interesting question.

367
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:27,080
Yeah, how does the idea of God come out of these psychedelic experiences?

368
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,440
It's an interesting question.

369
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:35,440
I don't necessarily know if I can answer it.

370
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:42,200
What I might say is that the general experience of psychedelics, how you could describe it

371
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:48,840
in some semi-scientific way I think would be to say it creates a kind of internal biological

372
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,200
singularity for a person.

373
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,600
Basically your senses get all mixed up in a way and you perceive everything all at the

374
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,280
same time and you don't have your filters on basically that you don't say, okay, this

375
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:04,240
is that, this is this.

376
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,200
You're mentally kind of incapacitated in a way and you're not capable of making any kind

377
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:15,000
of value judgments or doing anything like that.

378
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,080
So what happens is you get into this, what I would call a direct confrontation with reality.

379
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,720
You're really seeing reality for what it is when you're under the influence of psychedelics

380
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,400
is one way of looking at it.

381
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,620
Sometimes that reality can be terrifying.

382
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,400
Sometimes it can be very enjoyable.

383
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,720
It kind of depends on who you are as a person and how you're going into it, the mindset

384
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,280
you're bringing to it.

385
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:45,000
But the thing that I think most people experience is they get to this point where they see that

386
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,840
everything is somehow connected in our world and you become open to this idea I think of

387
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:56,600
a kind of vast depth to the world that you can't understand.

388
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,140
For example, we don't know where we come from as human beings.

389
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,520
We don't really know the answer to that.

390
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,120
We have some scientific theories, we have some history that shows us, okay, there were

391
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,720
people over here at this point in time.

392
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,920
But I mean, as far as where life comes from, all of these deep questions, psychedelics

393
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:18,500
kind of confront you with this reality that you don't really know, that we don't really

394
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:24,680
know and that there has to be some kind of, I think, author behind this.

395
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,480
And I think that it's a natural conclusion for people to come to when you see cause and

396
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,360
effect in your ordinary life, well, something had to cause us to end up here.

397
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:41,360
So you kind of come to this conclusion that there is something behind nature that is orchestrating

398
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:47,160
everything that we do in some way.

399
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:52,720
A lot of the language with, for example, the psychedelic community in the 1960s, I find

400
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:59,960
very similar to language you find in the Abrahamic religions about submission to God, right?

401
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,720
When you take trips, you got to let go, you got to let the thing take its course.

402
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,480
You can't try and control it or you're going to have a bad time.

403
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,480
It's the same way with, I mean, the Prophet Muhammad, you know, is all about submission

404
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,480
to God.

405
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,600
I mean, it sounds like he's giving advice about how to trip in some way.

406
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,480
So there's one way of looking at it for sure.

407
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,600
And Muhammad, especially in my opinion, has all of the cultural indicators of somebody

408
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,200
who's taking psychedelics.

409
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,720
But just to briefly close this up, one thing I would say is that how stoned ape theory

410
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:37,020
makes its way into the Bible, I think is actually pretty linear and pretty straightforward.

411
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:45,000
So the way that people stumbled upon these drugs in the earliest form was basically when

412
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,560
they were hunter gatherers, they were hunting livestock.

413
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,440
They'd track the animal and they'd look at the poop and they'd see, oh, there's some

414
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,440
mushrooms growing here.

415
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,040
And then they'd eat these things and they'd kind of get a physical invigoration out of

416
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,040
it.

417
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,500
You know, the fight or flight response gets kind of invoked.

418
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,520
And then they continue their hunt and, you know, so it became part of this hunting ritual,

419
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,840
you know, and this part of feeding your family and doing all of this.

420
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:14,520
This I think was very clearly carried over into the nomadic lifestyle of early Israelites.

421
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:19,040
They had cattle, they were domesticated by the time we get to the Bible, but they had

422
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,800
cattle, they were pooping everywhere around them.

423
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,440
They probably came into contact with these mushrooms and there's areas in the Bible where

424
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,560
you can say it's pretty clear that they did.

425
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,920
Exodus 16 is really the best example we have.

426
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:37,480
So where religion comes from, it's these people who are taking these drugs, I think, and basically

427
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,440
they have these imaginal experiences where they're visualizing everything in the world

428
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,280
and their sensors are kind of removed and they can really see how things work.

429
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,400
And so that leads to good planning.

430
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,040
That leads to good thinking about things and these people who can predict what's going

431
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:56,520
to happen end up earning the respect of their communities and they end up becoming leaders,

432
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:01,520
they become priests, they become saints, they have the ear of the God or whatever.

433
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,080
And so you get this whole administrative structure that leads to basically the first forms of

434
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,080
government, I think, out of that kind of scenario.

435
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,560
And it seems pretty clear when you look at the Bible that that's basically what it was.

436
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:18,800
It was the first leadership, the first clergy were the people who were taking these drugs,

437
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,040
having these direct experiences.

438
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:28,000
And that's basically what created religion in the form of the state as it was like in

439
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,680
Egypt and in these early primitive religions.

440
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,880
Religion and the state were one and the same.

441
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,160
So that deeper theological element, I try not to explain it too much because personally,

442
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,920
I mean, I'm kind of a believer, I believe that there is a deeper theological element

443
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,800
to taking hallucinogens and I don't think it's necessarily explainable.

444
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,980
I don't think we, I think it's kind of, the one thing that we can explain though is historical

445
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:57,140
events where people took this stuff or potential historical events that are recorded in places

446
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,760
like the Bible, also in places like Plutarch's Lives.

447
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:05,920
I think the Iliad has some records of people taking hallucinogens too.

448
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,880
And yeah, we can get into some of that as we go along here.

449
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:17,840
Yeah, I think it's not explainable by design, by the essence of the experience, which it

450
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:24,560
really goes to a deeper layer of the question that I asked because a lot of, not a lot of,

451
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:29,800
all of our understanding based on religions of this divine experience is based on words

452
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:37,360
and based on language, yet, as you correctly said, this experience is unexplainable.

453
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,920
This is something that I talk to my girlfriend a lot about it, that I don't even see the

454
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:47,680
point of trying to describe, for example, a DMT experience because language don't belong

455
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,680
there.

456
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,680
Exactly.

457
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,680
Right?

458
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,680
Yes.

459
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:56,600
So the question is, if people were having these divine experiences before the invention

460
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:04,200
of language, so this concept of a divine being, a higher power, higher being, must have been

461
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:10,000
developed before language was developed because we're using words and language in order to

462
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,320
dumb down this experience, to try to describe it to people who are reading it rather than

463
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,320
doing it.

464
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,320
Right?

465
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:24,080
If this is the case, then we are committing the biggest crime against humanity by not

466
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:30,680
allowing people to experience this divinity that belongs to not only all of us, to everything.

467
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,680
It is everything.

468
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,680
Right.

469
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,800
Directly.

470
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:38,040
But you see exactly why this is happening because if you can't have direct experiences,

471
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:44,320
then you don't need a priest and all these kind of people, most of whom are crooks and

472
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:51,400
businessmen and basically those merchants around the table that Jesus decided to mess

473
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,120
their shit up, basically.

474
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,120
Yeah.

475
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,120
Right.

476
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,120
Right.

477
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,120
Right.

478
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,080
Well, the thing about language is actually kind of interesting too.

479
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:05,400
So something that personally I've experienced with psychedelic drugs, but also that seems

480
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:11,880
to be kind of an emergent phenomena is that you have this activation of this linguistic

481
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,840
capacity with psychedelics.

482
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:21,820
And there's some notions that psilocybin may help grow brain cells.

483
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:28,720
So the way that it grows the brain evolutionarily can kind of make sense if you have pregnant

484
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:35,600
women taking hallucinogens, these mushrooms basically, in archaic society, they don't

485
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,600
know any better.

486
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,600
It's just this fun time.

487
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:43,040
They take this drug and it's probably in some capacity mutating the brain of the baby inside

488
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,040
their womb.

489
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:51,480
I would imagine it's like a kind of reverse fetal alcohol syndrome or something.

490
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,400
But as far as language is concerned, what you have is you have these hominids being

491
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:02,360
born with perhaps larger cranial capacity, larger brain size, and they take these drugs.

492
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,840
They probably continue this tradition.

493
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:09,760
And what happens is you're exposed to this very deep and inconceivable reality.

494
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:15,160
The natural impulse, I think, for us as human beings, as living things, is to categorize

495
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,600
and understand what it is we experience.

496
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,760
And the way that we do that is by developing terms and language and things that we share

497
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:29,160
in common and we relate with each other about what we experienced.

498
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:34,760
So language, I think, probably emerges out of that chaotic experience as an attempt to

499
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,840
try and explain some part of it.

500
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:44,920
So not necessarily, and I think that's a virtuous maybe to an extent to try and explain a piece

501
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,440
of it, but you have to recognize you're not going to get the whole thing.

502
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,680
You know, it's not going to happen.

503
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,320
I'm sure people will be wrestling with this, you know, what the psychedelic experience

504
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,320
is.

505
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:00,160
I mean, if they want, if they choose to, they'll probably be wrestling with it forever.

506
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:05,040
But I basically, as far as my book is concerned, I just focus on history because you can look

507
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,800
at history and you can point at texts and you can say, this might have happened here

508
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,920
or this might have been going on here.

509
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:15,320
And when you contextualize things like, for example, the Old Testament of the Bible, and

510
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,680
you pull out, you know, sources from ancient Egypt and, you know, the Amarna letters and

511
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:24,040
you kind of combine everything and you put it in the right historical context, you can

512
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:28,760
get a really deep picture of what was going on in the Old Testament.

513
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,760
I mean, it's kind of been shocking for me personally.

514
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,360
I was surprised as I was writing my book.

515
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,920
I'm like, why hasn't anybody done this yet?

516
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,920
I was totally shocked.

517
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:41,520
Please describe this as in depth as you possibly can, the relationship between Old Testament

518
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,520
and psychedelics.

519
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,520
Yeah.

520
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,920
Oh, well, there's a lot of building blocks.

521
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,840
So the way that I write my book is very linear, very chronological.

522
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,920
It starts from the beginning of Genesis and it just goes through the stories and I touch

523
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,760
on the big important pieces.

524
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,520
Basically, the way that I frame it out in the beginning parts is that the first couple

525
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,560
books of Genesis are kind of mythologies.

526
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,880
They're stories about, you know, Adam and Eve in the garden and you kind of have this

527
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,840
mushroom story going on there.

528
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:15,200
And then you also have Cain and Abel, which is basically a kind of polemic that's basically

529
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:21,020
agriculturalists versus nomadic hunter-gatherers, basically.

530
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:28,160
And basically, Yahweh, the Abrahamic God, doesn't like agriculturalists.

531
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:35,520
He refuses their offering, he banishes Cain and he sends them out of the city and Cain

532
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,560
then becomes jealous and he kills his brother Abel, who's a nomadic pastoralist who God

533
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,520
loves or whatever.

534
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:47,840
It seems to me it's a very simple kind of primitive form of propaganda that says, look,

535
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:52,640
the hunter-gatherer is the lifestyle that you want to have because they're not beholden

536
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:58,160
to these emperors and these pharaohs in Egypt or whatever.

537
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,080
They don't have to break their back working the land for somebody else, they get to just

538
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:06,520
have their cattle, they live out on the outskirts of civilization, they get to relax, take it

539
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,520
easy.

540
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,120
And this is the kind of way of life that is pleasing to the Abrahamic God.

541
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:15,400
And also, part of that is probably the fact that you have mushrooms growing out of their

542
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,840
poop and that's their sacrament and that's part of this whole ancient religion that goes

543
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:25,280
back to Terence McKenna and the, you know, the stoned ape theory is this partnership

544
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,280
society with cattle, with women and with mushrooms, basically.

545
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:36,560
And you see that partnership society carry on through the whole Old Testament, you see

546
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,560
it everywhere.

547
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,520
If you're paying attention to it and you're looking at it through the lens of Terence

548
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:44,980
McKenna, you see that there's a veneration of fertility, you know, Abraham's given the

549
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:48,640
promise by God, you're going to have lots of kids, you're going to have a lot of sex,

550
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:56,600
you know, and then you have the promise of, or you have the relationship with cattle throughout

551
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,600
the Old Testament.

552
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,720
The Israelites are nomads after they leave Egypt, they live with cattle and they live

553
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,360
in the wilderness, quote unquote.

554
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:10,400
And then you have, so it's the women, fertility, and then you have the mushrooms, and there's

555
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,080
a couple of different places where the mushrooms really assert themselves as a very plausible

556
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,200
explanation for things.

557
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:23,320
And the most obvious one is the manna, which is described in Exodus, we talked a little

558
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:30,320
bit about this, but the manna appears basically as soon as the Israelites leave the agricultural

559
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:35,760
civilization of Egypt and they revert to a nomadic lifestyle, that's when the manna appears,

560
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,200
which is very interesting because it's consistent with everything Terence McKenna talked about,

561
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:45,920
about how cattle-oriented societies would develop partnership relationships with these

562
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,920
drugs.

563
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:53,720
So, the Bible is very consistent with things that Terence McKenna said, it's really remarkable.

564
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:59,320
And it just all makes sense once you realize this is a nomadic society of people who are

565
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,040
living on the outskirts of civilization.

566
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:08,200
And Moses is actually trained by this priest named Jethro, Shuaib he's called in the Arabic

567
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:19,000
tradition, and his training is basically seems, Jethro is a shepherd, so he has flocks of

568
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,960
sheep and Moses takes care of these sheep.

569
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,840
And again, you know, the sheep poop and the mushrooms grow out because they're in a fertile

570
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:31,340
area that's warm, those are the conditions for growing psilocybin mushrooms.

571
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:37,280
When Moses has his vision of the burning bush, I don't consider that to be a DMT trip, what

572
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,680
I think was happening is while he's looking after the sheep, he ate some mushrooms and

573
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,640
then he walked over to this bush and he had this hallucination.

574
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,520
Because the way the Bible describes it is that the bush was burning, but it was not

575
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,500
consumed by the flame, so it's not literal.

576
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:54,400
He's having hallucination quite literally, he's already tripping by the point he approaches

577
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
this bush.

578
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:01,640
And then after that, he has this visionary experience where he basically sees the future

579
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,000
is the way that the Bible describes it.

580
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,240
Yeah, they might have retroactively went in there and written the future in to that experience

581
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:12,640
but basically this seems to me like the moment where he kind of develops his strategy about

582
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,040
how he's going to get the Israelites out of Egypt is under the influence of these drugs.

583
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:23,200
And it's this very interesting liberatory message and the psychedelics kind of inspire

584
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:29,920
Moses to basically set out by himself with nothing into Egypt to basically start these

585
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,420
negotiations with the Pharaoh and say, look, you know, the Israelites were done working

586
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,420
for you.

587
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:41,320
We're in our own nation, we're our own people and we're done.

588
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:45,680
But he doesn't phrase it that way, he actually phrases it and says, I want to go with my

589
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:50,440
people outside of Egypt to have a religious ceremony for three days.

590
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:57,120
So he's basically just trying to get them out of Egypt across the Red Sea and then they

591
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:02,080
can just establish themselves as nomadic society because he had been experiencing that and

592
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:07,120
living that lifestyle since he was kicked out of Egypt after he assassinated some Egyptian

593
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,160
slave driver, basically.

594
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:15,440
So it's this interesting political story that is like fueled by mushrooms as far as I can

595
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,920
tell.

596
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:23,720
Moses has these insights and these incredible strategic insights about how to deliver the

597
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:30,200
Israelites out of bondage and out of servitude to the Egyptian empire and his strategy is

598
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,300
just to have the Israelites revert to a nomadic lifestyle.

599
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:38,160
They were supposed to take cattle and they were supposed to take loans from the Egyptians

600
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,520
before they left and they did this apparently.

601
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:47,280
And so there's this whole thing where they they landed from the Egyptians and got their

602
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,840
jewelry basically because they wanted to make sacrifices to their God or whatever.

603
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,040
They made up some excuse is basically what happened.

604
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,700
And then they just left and then they had that in their possession.

605
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:05,620
So the way the Bible says it is that they plundered the Egyptians without bloodshed.

606
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:10,920
So they basically looted Egypt and left and started their own society and civilization

607
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,920
living in tents.

608
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,840
And that was a kind of traditional way of living for lots of people at that time.

609
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,040
So it wasn't necessarily crazy or anything.

610
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:25,280
I mean, it was a normal way for some groups of people to live and then he organized everybody

611
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,560
according to their 12 tribes.

612
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,800
I allude to the Atlantis myth, too.

613
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,840
I think Moses might have been familiar with that.

614
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:39,160
The Atlanteans had 10 kings and the 10 kings kind of oversaw different parts of society.

615
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,720
Moses seems to kind of apply that same principle to the Israelites.

616
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,800
There's 12 tribes and they're overseeing their own tribes and they have these kind of the

617
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,800
system of delegated judges.

618
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:56,220
So it's a very kind of distributed government that gets established and it's really interesting.

619
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:01,400
So you see the generation of the culture from scratch in that in that old biblical story.

620
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,600
A lot of people say it's not real.

621
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,480
I won't prove that it's not real if it's not real.

622
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,120
I mean, there's a reason that this text has been preserved for as long as it has survived

623
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:16,200
for as long as it doesn't even matter if it's real because people are acting based on the

624
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,280
belief and faith in it.

625
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,480
Well yeah, I do personally, I think you get to a point in Genesis where you start talking

626
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,880
about Abraham and you have these historical events taking place.

627
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,360
I don't think that an ancient culture or society would make up stories about their patriarchs

628
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,040
and live by it for thousands of years.

629
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,920
I don't think that makes sense.

630
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,580
I mean, that's just not something that they would do.

631
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,800
If they were going to make up a story, it would be about gods and angels and it would

632
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,920
be some kind of psychedelic visionary thing.

633
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:52,160
When you're talking about historical events, I don't see a reason to believe that these

634
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,400
people would have made this up.

635
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:00,000
I think it's a highly incredulous way of looking at this.

636
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,960
It doesn't give these people any credit.

637
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:07,000
I mean, they were living in primitive conditions most certainly, but they were able to survive.

638
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,880
They had to be smart in order to survive in those conditions.

639
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,800
They had to make sense of the world around them.

640
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:19,720
So I am very much a kind of apologeticist about the Bible.

641
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:24,040
But that being said, I don't necessarily take the dogmatic approach that people today take.

642
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:28,720
I take a historical approach, like how did this historically happen if it happened at

643
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,720
all?

644
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:35,160
And that's kind of how I approach the stories because it seems to me that there's lots of

645
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,840
things in there that are very plausible.

646
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,280
And we have more evidence now than we used to.

647
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:48,660
King Solomon, for example, or sorry, King David is referenced in this stella called

648
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,280
the Tel Dan Stella.

649
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:55,400
It's basically a Hittite stone tablet that references a King David and it dates to about

650
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,640
the time that King David should be around.

651
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,120
This wasn't, I think it was a pretty recent discovery.

652
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,960
So there's some of these recent discoveries that are coming out that seem to indicate

653
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,320
that yes, the Israelites were real.

654
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,340
They weren't like fan fiction of these ancient people.

655
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:14,320
They were a real historical group and they had an empire and they had a civilization.

656
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:19,220
And in some ways, I prove this actually in my book and I have some images that I've shared

657
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,600
with you that we can go over as well.

658
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:26,440
But yeah, if there's any questions or any statements you have on that, you can go ahead.

659
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,160
Well, there are a couple of things.

660
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:35,600
First of all, the entire psychedelic experience and psychedelics as substance, to me, it makes

661
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:41,840
sense that they've been preserved as some kind of an exclusivity throughout history

662
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,120
because it's being considered knowledge, the source of knowledge.

663
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,120
Right.

664
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,120
Yeah.

665
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:56,360
So it's not necessarily what Bible or any other book, whether fact or fiction is talking

666
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,360
about.

667
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:03,640
It's also how it's being defined and how the people who define those concepts and stories

668
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:10,080
and lessons and all those things and teachings, how they're being pushed by a, again, a group

669
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:15,160
of people who have been setting and driving a narrative that you were saying that it's

670
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:21,120
been discredited very viciously throughout our lifetime, definitely.

671
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:26,560
But this is a narrative that has been being built since really the enlightenment to minimize

672
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:32,600
the role of saying, quote unquote, God, because we don't really know what it is because a

673
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,440
lot of people have capitalized on the definition of it.

674
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,360
So they can just take power, right?

675
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,360
Right.

676
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:44,120
So in absence of in God we trust, it will be in state we trust or in kings we trust

677
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:50,120
or in, you know, there is no shortage of people who want to rule everybody else.

678
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,120
Right.

679
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,120
Yeah.

680
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:58,680
So what I'm saying is that it doesn't really matter at this point, especially whether or

681
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:03,120
not something can be even proven by evidence and fact, because there are tens of millions

682
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,960
of people who are like, oh, I just don't believe it.

683
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,920
It doesn't make sense to me.

684
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:14,160
You know, and what I'm saying is that this not being able to have the direct experience

685
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:20,780
and then make sense out of all these pieces that each part can resonate with you differently.

686
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:24,240
You know, you go and read the Bible, part of it resonates with you.

687
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,520
You read Bhagavad Gita, part of it resonates with you.

688
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:32,720
And out of all of that, you create that raft that Buddha is saying you build a raft, you

689
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,720
cross the river.

690
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,480
Once you cross the river, you don't need a raft anymore.

691
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,480
Right.

692
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,480
Sure.

693
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,480
Yeah.

694
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,480
Right.

695
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,480
Right.

696
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,480
Right.

697
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,480
Yeah.

698
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,480
Yeah.

699
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,480
I mean, I think there's insight and wisdom in all of these traditions.

700
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,480
No doubt.

701
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:54,400
I mean, I think it's an interesting argument to make that, you know, that this is a kind

702
00:46:54,400 --> 00:47:01,500
of perennial source for us today, as you were just saying, you know, to build that life

703
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:06,720
raft, you know, to kind of figure out our lives and to figure out.

704
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,880
And really, the big thing that has kind of been a part of my thinking for a long time

705
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:19,360
and something I put in the book pretty prominently is how do we build a better government that

706
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,800
doesn't do the things that we have going on today?

707
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:25,160
You know, how did the ancient people build their governments?

708
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,640
Because you know, they had to figure it out somehow.

709
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,600
What was the organizational principle?

710
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:35,360
What were they doing when they were establishing, you know, the Athenian Senate or, you know,

711
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,360
what was it?

712
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,920
What was the impetus that made them do this and create these institutions?

713
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,640
I think the psychedelic drugs are a big part of that.

714
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:49,280
I think so much so even that by the time you get to the Romans, that you have basically

715
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,040
what's called the stipend Palaeus symbolism.

716
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,520
It's the pole and the hat on top of it.

717
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,240
You've probably seen this iconography all over the United States.

718
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:02,140
It was a big piece of iconography.

719
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:07,160
This iconography in ancient Rome, I think, was a symbol of a mushroom.

720
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:12,120
And I think it was actually for the colonial Americans as well.

721
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,740
But what it meant was group government.

722
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:19,200
It meant collective thinking and action.

723
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,820
It was a senatorial congressional government.

724
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,080
That's what it was a symbol of.

725
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:29,320
And so when the Romans assassinated Julius Caesar, they kind of paraded the stipend Palaeus

726
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,760
around these mushroom symbols around saying, look, the group government is back.

727
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,600
We don't longer have this dictator Caesar anymore.

728
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:40,560
They appropriated this mushroom symbolism and used it to say, look, you know, the Senate's

729
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,560
back.

730
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,560
We're back in control.

731
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:47,160
We have a group government that's based on this ancient religious symbolism.

732
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:51,680
But they ended up, of course, getting overthrown very shortly after that.

733
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:58,940
So I don't necessarily think that the senators were authentic kind of religious practitioners

734
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:01,120
of this tradition at that time.

735
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,120
But the symbolism survived for a long time.

736
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:09,960
It was the symbol of a freed slave as well, which is very interesting because the Romans

737
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:15,400
had this idea about slaves that slaves can't be free because they don't have personal accountability.

738
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,400
They need a master.

739
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,680
They need someone to tell them what to do because they don't have a self-accounting

740
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,680
mechanism.

741
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,320
And this was their mentality back in those times.

742
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:29,440
And the thing that would set you free is to develop that self-accounting mechanisms, that

743
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:34,520
morality, that internal inspection, and something that can do that is psychedelic drugs.

744
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:39,000
I mean, so it's very interesting that this mushroom symbolism, the seemingly mushroom

745
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,120
symbolism became the symbol of the freed slave, someone who had gained self-mastery and self-consciousness

746
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,960
and self-awareness.

747
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:51,660
It's a very interesting thing, and it's also the symbol of freedom in the old biblical

748
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,040
stories as well.

749
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:57,380
So you see this happen over and over again, where when these psychedelic drugs get introduced

750
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:02,240
to a culture or a society, you have these situations where you have these kind of revolutionary

751
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:07,840
sentiments start to erupt and emerge, and that form new governments, I think.

752
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:11,840
And this is kind of my general historical theory that's kind of come out of my book,

753
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:16,320
is that this is how you build a better government, is you find people who take psychedelics and

754
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:19,720
you have them get in a room, you have them think about how to organize the society and

755
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:24,880
establish some basic rules, not necessarily to lord over or rule over other people, but

756
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:30,240
just for the sake of convenience of getting things done, because we can kind of see what's

757
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:35,800
happening now in our society, in America today, where everyone is just not accountable.

758
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:40,400
Everyone's just kicking the can down the road, and nobody's actually taking the crisis that

759
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,800
we're in seriously.

760
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:49,280
So I think a part of that lack of accountability, and I think of that as a religious problem,

761
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:54,520
that lack of ethics and that lack of loyalty to the people that you're supposed to serve.

762
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:59,680
I think this is a religious problem fundamentally, and I think the psychedelics are a big part

763
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,680
of that answer.

764
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:05,960
And the Bible is just a way for us to contextualize that experience, I think, and that's the way

765
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:09,480
that I look at the Bible and I look at the history of the Bible.

766
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:14,080
These guys did it already, so we can learn from them and bootstrap ourselves to that,

767
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:18,400
to their way of doing things to a certain extent, but we can create our own ways of

768
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,400
doing things.

769
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,920
We have a new environment, we have technology, we've got these live streams, we've got so

770
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:23,920
much.

771
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:34,520
But what I kind of just under the principles of the organization, obligated authority,

772
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:40,480
it's not all under one person's control or command, you have this kind of group government

773
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,480
in some way.

774
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,480
Decentralized.

775
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,480
Yeah, decentralized government, exactly.

776
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,480
Yes, yes.

777
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,800
So, sorry, I'm a little rambly, sorry.

778
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:48,800
No, no, no, no, no.

779
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:54,720
I mean, obviously, you're following a train of thought, I don't want to interrupt that.

780
00:51:54,720 --> 00:52:02,360
I think a big part of what you mentioned is exactly in the difference of time, that the

781
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:07,600
time that we're living in, considering the technology, and we talked about this with

782
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:13,340
Jason Giorgiani too, that I don't see the evolution of humanity any separate or any

783
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:16,160
different than evolution of technology.

784
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:22,200
I think we have, and psychedelics actually, for me, fits perfectly, because technology

785
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,080
is a tool.

786
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:30,080
Psychedelic is a source of intention behind the tool, how to use it, and I think the biggest

787
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:34,920
dilemma for humanity, exactly going back to this duality of religion, good and bad, right

788
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:42,120
and wrong, is that at the core of it, it's not this or that, good and bad, right or wrong,

789
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:48,500
it just is, and how you shape it and use it and whether or not you reach your objective

790
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,640
or not.

791
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,640
That's how it's been, right?

792
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:56,720
And the time that we're living in right now, when I talk to people, for example, I don't

793
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:02,800
think democracy is an efficient system of governance anymore, and they're like, well,

794
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,040
so what's better than that, fascism, communism?

795
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:11,640
The thing is, we might not even know the system that we need for this time that we haven't

796
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,440
ever experienced it.

797
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:18,640
We can't just go through the same bucket of recycled stuff and pull one out, like, okay,

798
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:23,560
let's try this, let's try this, let's try this, it's not working, and that's why it's

799
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:24,560
falling apart.

800
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,280
It's based on lies and deception and corruption.

801
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:32,880
Yeah, it might be a creative effort and endeavor for us to figure out what a new system looks

802
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,640
like that works in our time and for our needs.

803
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:43,280
Yeah, religions are basically their value systems and their ways of prioritizing your

804
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:49,240
values, and so I think in some ways we do have to, in some capacity, reconstruct some

805
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:53,240
kind of a modern religion of some form.

806
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:56,200
I think actually it's already happening in a way.

807
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:00,640
I think places like the Joe Rogan experience are a place where that religion is kind of

808
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:09,280
being birthed, and you have this kind of orientation around psychedelics, around masculinity, around

809
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:17,480
a few other science to a certain extent, and your diets, and your health, and your wellbeing.

810
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:22,200
All the lecturers and all the people that go through his show are a lot of bright people,

811
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:27,200
and that's kind of our priesthood in some ways, and a lot of our podcasters are a part

812
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,760
of our priesthood in some ways.

813
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:35,120
They're giving us condensed information that we can use and apply to our lives that hopefully

814
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:42,120
improve our lives in some capacity, and in some cases the one area that people aren't

815
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:47,280
going into because nobody wants to get in trouble is how do we fix the government, and

816
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:52,760
also because it's also an extremely complicated question and an extremely complicated problem.

817
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:58,560
I don't think anybody has all of the answers to how to do that, but I think it's an important

818
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,320
question to ask and to talk about for sure.

819
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:10,600
There's also a problem of how to define the we, because we in Florida is kind of different

820
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:15,000
than we in California, for example, in the context of the United States.

821
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Right.

822
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:22,080
Some people want more control and authoritarianism and tyranny because they think that, for example,

823
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:27,280
with respect to this virus, there is a way that you can defeat the virus, and some people

824
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:32,360
really do believe it, and people who don't believe it and lead and have access to resources,

825
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:35,960
they just capitalize on that and are like, okay, we're just kicking, as you said, kicking

826
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:41,220
the can down the road and keep changing the goalpost because this is an unreachable kind

827
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:45,200
of goal, and at the same time you see some people that are like, just leave me alone,

828
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,200
man.

829
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:49,080
I've got guns and I've got land, and if you come to my land, I'm going to shoot you with

830
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,080
my gun.

831
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,080
Right.

832
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,080
I don't know.

833
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:57,040
When I look at American history and I look at, and I've been doing that more as I'm kind

834
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:01,880
of writing my second book, that's a follow-up to my Old Testament kind of history book.

835
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:07,600
I've been looking at American history and I'm really impressed by the founders and how

836
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,720
insightful they were.

837
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:12,480
They were remarkably insightful.

838
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:17,880
They had a very limited, they had a sense of keeping the federal government fairly limited.

839
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:26,920
The jobs that it had basically were defense, so the military, and the currency.

840
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:30,640
There was an attempt at creating some kind of a universal currency that was managed by

841
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:36,000
the Congress, and other than that, the states generally had their kind of right to make

842
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,480
their own decisions.

843
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:43,680
I think that we're probably going to see some kind of reversion to more local government

844
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:44,680
in the United States.

845
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:45,680
Federalism, basically.

846
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:46,680
Revival of federalism.

847
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:51,480
Well, I don't know about a revival of federalism.

848
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:55,300
I think the opposite actually, where you're going to have, even county governments might

849
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:59,760
be very different from their neighboring counties in some cases.

850
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:04,280
If you live in a city or if you live in a rural area, I think you're going to have a

851
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:08,640
lot more regional policy making, and we're kind of seeing that actually with policy around

852
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,520
COVID and all of that.

853
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:16,560
I think you're going to see more regionalism happen, but it would be nice to have some

854
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:21,680
kind of federal framework where we can generally agree on some kind of fundamental principles

855
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:26,560
of what the federal government's supposed to do and what their job is.

856
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:29,680
Back in the day, it was the military, the defense of the country.

857
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:33,820
Everybody agreed that you wanted to keep the powers of Europe outside of our country because

858
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:37,260
they were all crazy monarchists.

859
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:39,040
Everyone really agreed on this.

860
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:44,400
All the states could agree to fight off the encroachment of the British Empire and keep

861
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:49,320
them basically in Canada because they couldn't get them out of Canada, but that was kind

862
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:52,320
of how it was.

863
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,320
Sorry.

864
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:57,920
By revival of federalism, I basically meant revision of federalism because there is some

865
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:58,920
kind of federalism.

866
00:57:58,920 --> 00:57:59,920
Yes.

867
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:00,920
A revision, certainly.

868
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:01,920
Yes.

869
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:02,920
A revision.

870
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:03,920
Yes.

871
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:04,920
A simplification.

872
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:11,040
Yes, simplification, dramatic simplification because if it's not simplified, I really don't

873
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,960
see any reason why big tech wouldn't take over the role of government.

874
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:15,960
Right.

875
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:19,680
It kind of has in a lot of ways.

876
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:24,320
I don't look at government as, they're like, oh, break up the big tech.

877
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,840
They're not going to do that.

878
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:32,720
They have this idea that they can run them and they can ride them basically according

879
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,480
to their intention and priorities.

880
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:39,080
I don't think that's smart either.

881
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:44,680
The new power and new source of resources basically is data.

882
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,680
It's not oil.

883
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:46,680
It's not gold.

884
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,680
It's data.

885
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:54,520
You see this currency that it's going to disrupt the hell out of US dollar and Chinese central

886
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,360
bank digital currency.

887
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:00,520
They're all decentralized digital information, pieces of information, cryptocurrencies and

888
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:01,520
Bitcoin.

889
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,520
Right.

890
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,520
Yeah.

891
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:09,720
There's interesting potential and possibilities there too.

892
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:14,480
I imagine that we're not very far away from a kid in his garage being able to build a

893
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,000
system of government on his computer.

894
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,080
I imagine we're not very far away from that.

895
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,080
Yeah.

896
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,080
With smart contracts.

897
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:22,080
Yeah.

898
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,080
Exactly.

899
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:32,480
It may be possible for us to develop a blockchain based electoral system and currency and basically

900
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,520
that could serve as a kind of federal government, quote unquote.

901
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:43,000
You'd want to have some kind of backups in real space and time just in case you have

902
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,160
some kind of electronic disaster, a solar flare or something.

903
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:53,160
You want to have something backed up, but that would serve the purpose at least of basically

904
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:56,400
everything that the federal government does.

905
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,960
If you're trading that currency, it can just automatically tax you however much you're

906
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:04,160
bringing in according to whatever the policy is.

907
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,760
It may be all automated.

908
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,760
You wouldn't need any government employees.

909
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:12,160
It would cost basically nothing.

910
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:18,120
There's a potential for some amazing stuff to happen with this technology.

911
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,240
It's really interesting.

912
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:24,200
There's lots of opportunities, but I think the biggest area where we have problems in

913
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:31,840
our society is basically in terms of ideology and in our divisiveness as a country.

914
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:35,040
The founders would call it faction and it was something that they were very against.

915
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,560
They were against the party system actually.

916
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,240
They didn't want to have political parties.

917
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:43,680
A lot of them were very much against forming political parties at all.

918
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:49,920
They wanted people just to run their personal merits for office and that was kind of it.

919
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:54,400
They didn't want there to be these warring parties in this divisive internal fighting

920
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,080
inside of the country, but inevitably it just happened that way.

921
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:06,680
It seems like a natural outcome of tolerance and diversity as ideology.

922
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:13,240
You shouldn't be tolerant against intolerant people and diversity has no place for people

923
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,300
who are against diversity.

924
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:21,320
You can't be like, hey, we accept cancer because it's just natural.

925
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:27,600
I don't really understand how any nation can survive when you have and I'm saying it as

926
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,600
an immigrant.

927
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:33,440
I've been living here five years, four years, I live in Canada 11 years, but I've been to

928
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,800
other places in the world.

929
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:41,440
No serious country will allow people who hate that country fundamentally to play the role

930
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:46,440
of policy makers and lawmakers and leave their borders open and they're like, well, people

931
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:47,840
need help.

932
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,600
What?

933
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:56,400
You cannot treat a country and a nation like this and say that this is a serious country.

934
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,080
Precisely.

935
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:07,480
Part of that too, the factionalism is that it gets weaponized by commercial interests.

936
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:12,440
What happens is you have the Democratic Party is all about bringing in all of these underprivileged

937
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:15,800
people or at least that's how they market it, that's how they sell it, but what they're

938
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:21,320
really doing is they're getting slave wage labor into the country so that they don't

939
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,320
become-

940
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,640
You have voters.

941
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:30,600
You get hooked on slave labor wage and therefore you become dependent on government based on

942
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:36,560
some kind of a UBI or a food coupon or whatever and then you keep voting for the party that

943
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:38,880
is feeding you from the palm of their hand.

944
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,160
It's disgusting.

945
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:45,200
Yeah, it is.

946
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:50,520
That being said though, if our government was managed correctly, we could handle bringing

947
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,400
in as many immigrants as we wanted to.

948
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,960
If we had a public works program that just made sure that everybody had housing and everyone

949
01:02:55,960 --> 01:03:01,360
was employed all the time, yeah, we could bring in as many people as we wanted to.

950
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:06,000
Because we have so much natural resources in this country, we could literally do that

951
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,960
for maybe 100 years and then at that point, maybe it'd probably be too much.

952
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:18,240
We could manage taking in tons of immigrants if we had a well-managed functioning government,

953
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,760
but the problem is that we don't.

954
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:25,560
Basically it's run by crooks who are in the private sector and that's basically a big

955
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:31,600
part of what that problem is.

956
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:37,800
To me, the way to fix this is we need psychedelic people in office who are familiar with the

957
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:42,000
psychedelic experience and have that inward sense of accountability, responsibility and

958
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,320
they try to do good just fundamentally as a character.

959
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:49,800
I totally agree with that and I think that's the moral high ground basically to say that

960
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:55,040
I've done psychedelics and I face my demons, my shadows.

961
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:59,600
How far do you think we are as a society for someone to run in this platform?

962
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:05,800
I am psychedelic conscious to the table.

963
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:06,800
I don't know.

964
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:12,160
It's funny and it's meme-worthy, who knows?

965
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:21,160
I think that's a great qualifying point of qualification, I guess.

966
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:27,240
To have somebody who basically says, yes, I've taken psychedelics, I've faced my demons,

967
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:32,360
I've looked at the world and I want to try and do good things, it's really simple.

968
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:33,360
It's really simple stuff.

969
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:37,880
If you have somebody with the right attitude to go into government and doesn't compromise,

970
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:42,200
doesn't sell out, you're going to have at least the prospect of sorting a couple of

971
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,960
things out.

972
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:49,720
I think until you get that psychedelic personality though, and I don't think it can be just one.

973
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:54,160
I think you need lots of senators, lots of county government people.

974
01:04:54,160 --> 01:05:00,680
You need people across the board stepping up to the plate and just doing something.

975
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:05,520
It can't just be one leader, I don't think.

976
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,640
Maybe it could, but that's the whole concept of the Caesar.

977
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,440
I don't know if you're familiar with that or not.

978
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,440
Yeah, right.

979
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,040
Very popular now because people are basically looking for everywhere.

980
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,040
Right.

981
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:19,440
If people have problems, they're looking for someone from somewhere to come and fix that

982
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,400
problem without them doing anything.

983
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,400
Right.

984
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,400
Yeah.

985
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:27,560
I think theoretically, I like the idea of the Caesar.

986
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:28,560
I like the idea.

987
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:29,560
Yeah.

988
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:30,560
I like the idea.

989
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:36,960
Add psychedelics into the mix and I'm like, yeah, it's a go, it's a go.

990
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:44,720
Yeah, it's interesting, but it would be very efficient actually if the country became just

991
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:49,440
totally willing to hand over that much power to somebody to just basically restructure

992
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,720
the government, basically change everything.

993
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,160
That would be wild.

994
01:05:55,160 --> 01:06:00,160
You could do a lot with one person.

995
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,560
That's something I've thought about too.

996
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:04,840
It's like, what could one person do?

997
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:05,840
It's an interesting question.

998
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,800
I've thought about it too much maybe, but yeah.

999
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:08,800
Elon Musk.

1000
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:09,800
Yeah, Elon Musk.

1001
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:16,580
Not to run the country, but the answer to the question, what can one person do?

1002
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:21,620
The answer is Elon Musk because we are in a different timeline and different reality

1003
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:24,880
after this dude pushed for reusable rockets.

1004
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,280
It's a different game completely.

1005
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,280
Yeah, right.

1006
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:29,280
Sure, sure.

1007
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,280
Yeah, it's different.

1008
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:34,600
That's what one person can do, but the problem is that there are a lot of people who are

1009
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:42,200
invested in things that those disruptive innovations will disrupt.

1010
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:47,360
These people are in positions of power and I don't believe they can win.

1011
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:52,680
We cannot win against technology, but they're slowing down everything at the cost of the

1012
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:57,280
future and prosperity of the nation that they're supposed to be representing.

1013
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,720
Yeah.

1014
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:04,720
I think the biggest, like I said, the biggest challenge we have is this religious problem

1015
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:07,560
and this internal division.

1016
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:13,480
I think that once people start uniting around a central principle or an organizational principle,

1017
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:18,440
then naturally you'll have some leadership figures start to emerge that can leverage

1018
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:20,160
that group.

1019
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:25,720
Right now, there's a big divide and conquer strategy going on that's very effective, I

1020
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:26,720
think.

1021
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:29,040
Very effective in its working wonders.

1022
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:36,960
It has half a country hating the other half and it is a divide and conquer strategy to

1023
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:42,280
get hold of the government and it's remarkable to me that it's gone as far as it's gone and

1024
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,800
that people aren't snapping out of it yet.

1025
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:48,800
Personally, I think more than half of the comments and everything on Twitter and YouTube,

1026
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,800
I think they're all fake.

1027
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,880
I think that lots of the times, these are bot organizations.

1028
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,940
They're paying people to go and post and manufacture consent.

1029
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:03,880
They're smart enough to realize that public opinion is made on places like Twitter, Instagram,

1030
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:08,400
and so they leave comments on anti-regime rhetoric.

1031
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:13,880
If Nicki Minaj, for example, just happened the other day, they leave comments on these

1032
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:21,240
people's pages that make them look like social outcasts or whatever and that politicize everything

1033
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:26,720
that happens in our society because it is a super effective way of keeping everybody

1034
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:33,520
divided and to keep us from coming to what you could call a populist political center.

1035
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:41,020
I think that basically, the Rust Belt is the future of American politics.

1036
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:45,160
Whatever happens in the Rust Belt, if there is a social or political transformation in

1037
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:50,560
the Rust Belt, it can totally overthrow everything in politics.

1038
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:57,000
For me, as a midwesterner myself, I think one of the reasons I actually wrote my book

1039
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:04,920
is that, look, if we oriented ourselves towards a more fundamentalist paradigm and perspective

1040
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:14,440
in terms of just original, very basic questions about where humans come from, who are we?

1041
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:18,800
The answer to that question, as far as I can tell, is psychedelics.

1042
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:22,820
Psychedelics are the center of what caused us to become human.

1043
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:26,120
Maybe there's aliens involved in there somewhere, I don't know, but psychedelics seem to play

1044
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:30,120
a very prominent role through all world history.

1045
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:34,920
Part of the revival of American culture, I think, will involve reclaiming that legacy

1046
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:35,920
in some way.

1047
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:41,280
I absolutely believe it and I've come to a pretty interesting conclusion about George

1048
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,280
Washington.

1049
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:43,280
I think he was a psychedelic head.

1050
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:46,520
I really do.

1051
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:48,400
He was friends with Native Americans.

1052
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:54,880
He's smoked from a peace pipe and he has a vision at Valley Forge, which you can read

1053
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:59,720
about, which is totally remarkable and totally interesting, that basically kind of describes

1054
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:02,980
the future of the country in some ways.

1055
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:07,520
People say it's not historical, it's fake, it was published in the 1850s.

1056
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:16,080
It was published in the 1850s, but it was supposedly told to this journalist by a Revolutionary

1057
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,280
War soldier.

1058
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:23,440
It seems kind of unreasonable to me that during the 1850s, kind of during the tumult before

1059
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:29,840
the Civil War, you're going to have this, basically somebody slandered George Washington

1060
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:36,360
in a Revolutionary War veteran in the same breath with this newsletter that was published

1061
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:40,960
that basically is George Washington, he's sitting in his barracks at Valley Forge and

1062
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:46,160
he basically starts feeling these weird sensations and he gets sick to his stomach a little bit

1063
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:51,440
and then he has this vision and these angels come and tell him the future of the nation.

1064
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:52,440
It's remarkable.

1065
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:56,000
It's a psychedelic trip and I think it was like an accurate report of the future in some

1066
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
way.

1067
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:02,480
I can't explain why or how, but I think that that's part of the mystery of this stuff and

1068
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:07,320
it's been used for divination for a long time and probably because it works if you do it

1069
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:08,320
the right way.

1070
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:13,040
I mean, I don't know if we necessarily know how to do it the way that these people did

1071
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:16,600
in the ancient times or maybe it's just blind luck.

1072
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:21,240
Maybe just every once in a while you just get a glimpse into some kind of quantum reality

1073
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:25,120
that allows you to see some kind of potential future or something like this.

1074
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:29,800
I think this happened with George Washington and that's going to be in my second book that

1075
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:30,800
I'm working on.

1076
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,560
You can read the story of Valley Forge if you're interested in that.

1077
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:35,960
It's a remarkable story if you haven't read it yet.

1078
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:42,200
I think a lot of people get into psychedelic experiences with some kind of a preconception

1079
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,680
or some kind of a bias.

1080
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:48,080
They've already made a decision about what is enlightenment, what is God, what is all

1081
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:53,360
these things and they go with that kind of an expectation into the experience and they

1082
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:56,560
get something else and they call it a bad trip or whatever.

1083
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:01,680
They do it a couple of times, they don't do it again or they keep doing it with kind

1084
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:06,280
of that bias in their head all the time that hey, I got it, I'm enlightened, I know God.

1085
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:10,960
So they start creating their own communities and try to see people wearing the same kind

1086
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,920
of clothing, listen to the same kind of music.

1087
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:20,520
But there is also an approach that it's like a feedback loop.

1088
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:24,920
You're in this reality and then you have the kind of a psychedelic experience which is

1089
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:34,800
a mirror into who you really are and then you come back and it's like a, again, technology

1090
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:39,920
and humanity kind of evolution that you evolve with and because of it.

1091
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:45,880
And at some point you got to realize that even psychedelic is a tool because if that

1092
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:51,880
is becoming a God itself then I think you haven't got it because it's the experience

1093
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:58,760
of what is rather than holding on to anything whether it's religion or culture or your identity

1094
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:01,040
or psychedelics or anything like that.

1095
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:08,160
And that's the dilemma really that the core of this kind of thing is in a way pointing

1096
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:13,880
away from the conventional understanding of government and governance that we do have.

1097
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:18,940
That there is a group of people who are going to be in charge of things and it goes way

1098
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:26,320
closer to what you're describing the more of a regional, localized kind of structure

1099
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:33,440
but again, it's a system that we have to develop based on our technology and our understanding

1100
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,560
and our objective and this time.

1101
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:40,920
Right, right, yeah and I think, I don't know, I have a lot of hope and faith in the younger

1102
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:45,840
generation just because I mean, well, one, they're growing up with the internet, they're

1103
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:50,800
growing up with access to lots of information and they can see through the propaganda and

1104
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:58,400
the bull crap and that's a good, I mean, that's a really good sign.

1105
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:01,440
Things that I see online are just the way kids talk about the government and how they

1106
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:08,680
just have no trust or respect for it is very good as far as I'm good because that's going

1107
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:12,320
to lead to some kind of really radical transformation at some point.

1108
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:18,600
It's going to end up there and it's going to happen and also the fact that they're open

1109
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:23,400
to people like Joe Rogan and that they're getting this education on Terrence McKenna

1110
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:28,780
and the role of these psychedelic drugs and their potential role in ancient history.

1111
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:32,000
This is going to train up and raise up like a new generation.

1112
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,080
I mean, they used to call it the indigo children, you know, the 90s, right?

1113
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,520
I really think it's a phenomena.

1114
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:45,280
I think it's going to really have a huge impact on our cultural footprint in a way.

1115
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:50,120
I think that we're just getting into the stages where it's going to be the case that you have

1116
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:54,160
these indigo children kind of leadership figures who really start getting serious about like

1117
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:58,760
leading the government and doing things like that because really that's what psychoanalysis

1118
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:01,960
psychedelics were for going back into antiquity.

1119
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:06,480
The reason that, you know, the priests of antiquity took this stuff is because it gave

1120
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:10,040
them insights into the way into reality.

1121
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:14,560
They could anticipate trends and a big part of how they do it too, which is something

1122
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:18,360
I get to in the book, is that they regionalized it.

1123
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:23,720
They had these ceremonies at temples so you'd have all these people come from all over and

1124
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:27,840
they'd come, they'd have these trips and then they'd explain what they saw in their visions

1125
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,900
and that would kind of explain subconsciously like things that they thought and how they

1126
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:32,900
perceive the world.

1127
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:37,400
And you could kind of build this map of like what everyone is thinking and the direction

1128
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,240
that society is going in.

1129
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:45,840
So it was this very advanced map making ceremony, I think, is what a psychedelic trip was in

1130
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:46,840
a group.

1131
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:51,180
It was, so you'd have these conversations with people and, you know, that's what confession

1132
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:56,760
was when it came to priests, they would, you know, you get this confession and it was intelligence

1133
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:57,760
gathering.

1134
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:02,400
So these temple centers were places where people went to take psychedelic drugs, they

1135
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,320
confessed, they told the priests about everything.

1136
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:08,280
So the priest was taking these drugs and integrating all this information and trying not to have

1137
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:11,200
biases and just see it for what it is.

1138
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:16,360
And the psychedelics were just this way of deconstructing their own thoughts and not

1139
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:20,040
getting stuck in any kind of paradigm.

1140
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:24,600
I think, at least, that's the way that I see it and it seems like a really magnificent

1141
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:27,960
system that probably worked pretty well.

1142
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:34,000
And another thing that I kind of talk about in my book is that classical architecture

1143
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:39,280
actually is probably more ancient than ancient Greece, probably goes back to the Semitic

1144
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:48,040
and Anatolian regions, and that I basically trace one really big archaeological site to

1145
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:51,240
King Solomon that is considered to be a Roman site.

1146
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:57,080
But I trace it to King Solomon and actually, I'll just say it's Baalbek.

1147
01:16:57,080 --> 01:17:01,600
I think Baalbek was the temple of King Solomon in the Bible.

1148
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:05,200
And I'm not the only person who thinks this, there's lots of people in Lebanon who just

1149
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:06,200
say this.

1150
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,920
This is what the oral tradition in Lebanon is.

1151
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:13,840
It's that Baalbek is the temple of Solomon and they also call it the Tower of Babel.

1152
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:21,440
And so the Eurocentric view that has been applied to the history of the Middle East

1153
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:22,920
has erased so much history.

1154
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:26,680
It has erased so much, it's remarkable.

1155
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:31,800
And it's also kind of mycophobic because the Anglo-Saxon world is kind of very historically

1156
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,840
afraid of mushrooms.

1157
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:39,280
So this has caused us to totally black out a piece of this history that is, I think,

1158
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:43,080
absolutely integral to the proper functioning of society.

1159
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:45,800
What is the cause of that fear?

1160
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:50,160
Well one is that some mushroom species will kill you.

1161
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:54,560
So they're used as poisons in some places in antiquity.

1162
01:17:54,560 --> 01:18:01,160
And the British Empire probably had maybe a larger abundance or maybe there were more

1163
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:05,760
assassinations that happened through the use of mushrooms, I'm not totally sure, but it's

1164
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:09,080
definitely an Anglo thing.

1165
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:16,400
And so when that fear just applied to the rest of history, you lose so much, you lose

1166
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,400
so much.

1167
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:18,400
It's really amazing.

1168
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:23,400
And Gordon Lawson actually touches on this about the mycophobia of the Anglo-Saxon worldview

1169
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:26,000
is actually what got him interested in his scholarship.

1170
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:31,480
He's one of the first mushroom mycologists is that his wife was a Russian and she loved

1171
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:32,480
mushrooms.

1172
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:37,640
She picked a bunch of Amanita mysterias on their honeymoon and brought them like a gift,

1173
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:41,400
like look, we have these drugs we can take and it's our honeymoon, we're going to get

1174
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:42,680
wild and have a good time.

1175
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:44,680
And he just flipped out and he lost his mind.

1176
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:45,680
He's like, are you crazy?

1177
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:47,680
These are going to kill us.

1178
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:53,780
So that interaction fascinated him and basically started his career as a mycologist.

1179
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:55,680
Why the hell did I have that reaction?

1180
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:59,960
It was my honeymoon and she wasn't worried at all.

1181
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:04,140
And also I think that part of that reaction too is the psychological effect that these

1182
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:06,080
drugs have on some people.

1183
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:10,440
If you're not willing to let go of those cultural biases that you have when you go in, you're

1184
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:11,760
going to have a bad time.

1185
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,240
You're going to have a very bad time.

1186
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:18,520
You're going to question who you are, you're going to have all these really hard questions.

1187
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:19,520
Which is the point.

1188
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,800
And that's the point, exactly.

1189
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,440
So that's part of the funny thing of this.

1190
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:28,840
There's like this natural threshold and this natural barrier that keeps like certain people

1191
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:29,840
out.

1192
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:32,040
It's just this weird, I don't know.

1193
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,040
That's the matrix.

1194
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:34,040
That's the cage.

1195
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:35,040
Yeah.

1196
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,040
Right.

1197
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:41,440
And on the other side of it, people have difficulty to define themselves, to identify themselves.

1198
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:44,160
Yes, yes, yes, yeah.

1199
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:49,280
So you got to be open to that, to not having all the answers right away.

1200
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:53,520
If you're going to take this stuff and you want to do your research and you want to take

1201
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:56,520
stuff that's not going to kill you if you can.

1202
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:59,680
And you have to be careful because some of them are deadly.

1203
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:04,000
If you pick the wrong mushroom and you're out in the forest, not every mushroom is going

1204
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,600
to get you high and give you a good time.

1205
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:06,880
Some of them will just kill you.

1206
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:11,840
And so that's kind of part of the reason why the Anglo-Saxon world is a little more mycophobic.

1207
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:19,120
What are the most significant examples of a psychedelic system, government, society,

1208
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:24,400
civilization throughout history, according to your research?

1209
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:27,560
I would say the Abrahamic religions, actually.

1210
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:30,020
That's what I would say.

1211
01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:33,720
Maybe the colonial government in America as well.

1212
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:39,080
The Freemasons seem to kind of carry some of that mushroom mysticism.

1213
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:44,840
It seems that was kind of the primary vessel that brought it over to the United States.

1214
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:48,440
But the Native Americans had their own traditions too.

1215
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:51,560
But yeah, definitely the Old Testament government.

1216
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:56,840
Basically the way that it worked is that with Moses, you had the tabernacle.

1217
01:20:56,840 --> 01:21:00,120
You had the high priest and you had the priest around the priest.

1218
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:05,640
And the tabernacle was where basically people brought animals to be sacrificed to Yahweh.

1219
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:08,520
But this was a form of actually paying taxes back then.

1220
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:09,720
They were a nomadic society.

1221
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:13,400
All their wealth was in these livestock animals.

1222
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:16,720
So what they would do is they'd bring this and then everyone would have a feast on the

1223
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:17,720
Sabbath.

1224
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:22,560
I think it's Saturday for Jewish people, but it's not really correlated to our calendar

1225
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,120
so it doesn't really matter.

1226
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:27,380
But every seven days they'd have some kind of a feast.

1227
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:29,680
So all the poor people would be able to eat.

1228
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:37,680
It was a kind of redistribution of wealth and you could go to the priest if you had

1229
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:41,880
a problem, if you were a poor person or let's say somebody committed a crime against you.

1230
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:46,360
You could go to the priest and they'd sort it out.

1231
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:52,400
The temple was a total governmental administrative place where people were taking hallucinogenic

1232
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:56,480
drugs and that's just how the system works.

1233
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,240
And it worked pretty well in those times.

1234
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:02,440
Obviously, we're not going to bring sheep to the White House and have them slaughtered

1235
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:09,760
and have everybody have a feast because that's just not going to work for us today.

1236
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:15,520
But as a model, it worked back then and you can get those fundamental principles out of

1237
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:18,440
that religion and you can apply it in a similar way.

1238
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:19,440
There was charity.

1239
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:22,720
There was some form of charity and Islam does a good job of this too.

1240
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:25,960
They established the Zakat at least in the early days.

1241
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:34,520
I think that Islam was largely corrupted pretty honestly and it basically became very non-psychedelic,

1242
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:39,840
very authoritarian, very against the kind of...

1243
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:40,840
Political.

1244
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:45,240
Yeah, very political.

1245
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:48,760
But for a little while, it seemed to really function well and I think that's why it grew

1246
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:53,840
so quickly and it was adopted so quickly.

1247
01:22:53,840 --> 01:23:00,600
It congealed all these different religions and I think that it was probably more or less

1248
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:03,840
acceptable to take some kind of hallucinogen.

1249
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:10,440
When you look at Arabic art and Eastern art, very clearly has hallucinogenic influence.

1250
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:15,020
The arabesque is these infinitely repeating patterns, very clearly something that's inspired

1251
01:23:15,020 --> 01:23:20,080
from these fractal geometric figures that you can see under the influence of these drugs

1252
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:22,560
as far as I'm concerned.

1253
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:30,520
Then you have drugs like a Syrian roux, particularly in Iran, still commonly used as an incense.

1254
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:37,720
It's got an anti-depressive effect, but it also activates DMT.

1255
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:43,800
Any kind of DMT in your regular food will get a slight activation from that incense.

1256
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:50,440
You might not necessarily perceive it, but you might recognize it.

1257
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:52,320
There's drugs all over the Middle East.

1258
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:55,000
Drugs are a part of some cultures out there too.

1259
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Iran, still.

1260
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Yeah, sure.

1261
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Right, right, right.

1262
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Absolutely.

1263
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
It's coming right from Afghanistan.

1264
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Right.

1265
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Yep, yep.

1266
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:07,560
Our next door neighbor was actually, when I was growing up there, he was smoking it

1267
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:12,520
and he would come through our house through air conditioning system.

1268
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:16,520
My mom was getting so pissed and like this guy was smoking opium again.

1269
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:17,520
No kidding.

1270
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:18,520
Yeah, yeah.

1271
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:23,840
There are places, like southern cities, there's one place, Kerman, especially, that when you

1272
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:30,240
go to someone's house, if they want to respect you, they bring you tea and opium and it's

1273
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,360
part of their customary.

1274
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:33,920
Right, man.

1275
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:38,160
I mean, yeah, those are traditions that probably go back a while, I'd imagine.

1276
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:39,160
Yeah.

1277
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:41,520
I mean, yeah, because why wouldn't you do that?

1278
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:46,480
You have a guest over, you know, get them loaded up and having a good time so they're

1279
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:49,080
not like judging you or like, you know, being an asshole.

1280
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:52,480
Yeah, you don't do that because, you know, people who run the system, they're like, if

1281
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:56,240
you do this shit, you don't want to go to a school or join the workforce because they're

1282
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:57,560
like, why the fuck am I doing that?

1283
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:02,120
I just sit outside and play flute and look at butterflies and watch the clouds go by.

1284
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:03,760
It's a good way to live life.

1285
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:04,760
Right.

1286
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:05,760
Yeah.

1287
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:09,160
I mean, personally, I take an attitude of like some moderation.

1288
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:12,160
You know, I'm pretty moderate about my use.

1289
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:21,080
But yeah, I mean, it's just been part of human culture forever.

1290
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:25,680
And it's just ridiculous to have the taboos around it that have been around.

1291
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:27,400
They're going away now, thankfully.

1292
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:34,080
But yeah, I share that article with you about how employers in the United States now are

1293
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,520
not requiring drug tests.

1294
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:36,640
Amazon is one of them.

1295
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:39,400
There's a couple other ones that are jumping on board with that.

1296
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:40,400
For marijuana, at least.

1297
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:45,400
So, you know, I know people from different countries who are, you know, like let's say

1298
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:51,000
from Iran, the dude knows the Farsi language and knows the cultural context and stuff.

1299
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,760
And therefore he could be considered an asset for CIA.

1300
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:58,080
But the problem is he's done a little too much asset.

1301
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:59,080
Sure.

1302
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:00,080
Right.

1303
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:07,320
So these are not good points of government because somebody who's done a lot of psychedelic

1304
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:11,840
experiences could be very useful to CIA, for example, you know, the kind of perspective

1305
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,300
that they're bringing.

1306
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:16,560
But I know for a fact that they're saying marijuana, you shouldn't have smoked for

1307
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:17,800
the past 12 months.

1308
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:21,560
I'm using CIA as an extreme example because they say it on their website.

1309
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:26,200
But other drugs, they're going to have further conversations like, I wonder what other drugs

1310
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:27,200
are.

1311
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:30,840
For example, they were like, what have you done, DMT, asset, blah, blah, okay, dude,

1312
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:34,280
we can't work with you, you know, right off the bat.

1313
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:37,680
And the FBI, as I mentioned, they were looking for hackers, but they couldn't find anybody

1314
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:39,240
who wasn't smoking weed.

1315
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:40,960
So they dropped that requirement.

1316
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:43,600
Right, right, yeah, yeah.

1317
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:44,600
That's interesting.

1318
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:49,160
I mean, I mean, the whole Silicon Valley thing too, technology as this kind of extension

1319
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:52,080
of our, of our evolution too, it makes a lot of sense.

1320
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:57,480
So what you were saying earlier, yeah, I mean, the people in Silicon Valley have been experimenting

1321
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:58,480
with these drugs.

1322
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:03,840
I mean, you know, LSD, I mean, that's where the hippie movement really kind of took off.

1323
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:08,160
I mean, in the 1960s, and that culture has kind of been there in the subculture, I mean,

1324
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:09,160
the whole time.

1325
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:12,320
So yeah, it's been going on for a long time.

1326
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:19,100
And that's, that's something that bugs me to high heaven when I hear conservative people

1327
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:24,960
go on these shows and just like talk about how, you know, psychedelic drugs are a menace.

1328
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:25,960
Hippies were a menace.

1329
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:29,080
Like, are you, are you crazy?

1330
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:31,960
Hippies created this world that we live in, in a lot of ways.

1331
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:36,320
Yeah, they got straight and they went to work and they, you know, but they still, you know,

1332
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:41,280
smoke joints on the side and they were, they still kept that, that certain kind of rebelliousness

1333
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:44,000
even in their character.

1334
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:49,280
And that's part of the whole startup culture is breaking away from that business world.

1335
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:54,640
And you get a couple people together with computer and you write up some code and you

1336
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:55,640
create your own thing.

1337
01:27:55,640 --> 01:28:00,600
I mean, this is like this weird, like hippie thing that emerged in Silicon Valley.

1338
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:08,040
I mean, it's totally like values from the 1960s applied to these, these startups that

1339
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:13,320
come out of these psychedelic drugs and this, this disregard for the official way of doing

1340
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:18,880
things on these kind of hierarchical authoritarian systems.

1341
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:23,280
So it's people totally discredit, not just in American history, but also going back into

1342
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:28,880
antiquity, the profound role that these drugs had on the development of our thinking and

1343
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:31,560
the development of our governments and of our technology.

1344
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:33,840
I mean, it's really remarkable.

1345
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:38,460
I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if like more than 50% of like all technological innovations

1346
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:43,080
were from people who had some kind of drug experiences or something.

1347
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:44,080
Scientific discoveries.

1348
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:45,080
Exactly.

1349
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:46,080
Yeah.

1350
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,080
Cause it gets you out of your head.

1351
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:48,680
It makes you think about things differently.

1352
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:53,900
And you know, it's a great catalyst for, for that.

1353
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:58,200
If you have the right mentality for it, you know, but it's also, you know, it's good for

1354
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:02,680
recreation too, but it's, but it can produce a lot of good for society.

1355
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:07,880
And it's so annoying to me when you, when these, these right wing conservative guys

1356
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:13,400
just get so serious about ridiculous and they're very blind, both about technology and about

1357
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:17,640
psychedelics because you know, you don't have to go that far to see them.

1358
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:23,280
More veterans are dying out of the battlefield here in the United States than they have died

1359
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:28,320
in battlefield and a lot of it is because they don't have access to the right kind

1360
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,320
of medicine.

1361
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:33,440
You know, there's a documentary made about these two veterans who came back and one of

1362
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:38,080
them got hooked on, I think, opium and they ended up doing ayahuasca.

1363
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:40,760
I think one of them did, or two of them did ayahuasca.

1364
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:45,240
One of them did MDMA, MDMA therapy.

1365
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:49,360
And they're like, I can't believe it that how much it has helped.

1366
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:53,880
And all those years that we got hooked on pharmaceuticals and all this chemical nonsense

1367
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:58,000
that, you know, basically little by little destroyed us.

1368
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Right.

1369
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Yeah.

1370
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,320
People are waking up and they're seeing these alternatives and people are talking about

1371
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:04,320
it too.

1372
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:10,760
And so it's spreading this, the awareness that, you know, the corporatized, you know,

1373
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:14,480
way of doing things in America is just doesn't work at all.

1374
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:18,440
It just doesn't fundamentally work and that there's other alternatives and that really

1375
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:23,840
the 1960s, the people in the 1960s were onto something, but that whole revolution was put

1376
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:24,840
down.

1377
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:31,360
I think we almost had this kind of grand revolution in the 60s, like, but it was all put down

1378
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:33,240
by the CIA, basically by the deep state.

1379
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:39,320
You had JFK get assassinated, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, a lot of other people were

1380
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:44,140
literally assassinated for having the wrong views and the wrong ideas who worked their

1381
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:49,160
way into positions of massive social and cultural influence.

1382
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:51,720
I don't think, I think that it's going to happen again, but I don't, I think it's going

1383
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:57,040
to be so widespread and the, I think that the government's ability to muster some kind

1384
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:01,080
of militarized response to this is going to be nil.

1385
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:05,440
There's going to be no way that they're going to be able to respond to the, this kind of

1386
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:08,640
what I think is going to be a resurgent psychedelic revolution.

1387
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:09,920
I really think it's going to happen.

1388
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:14,920
I think it's, we're in the, in the throes of it to a certain extent now, because I mean,

1389
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:20,960
really people kind of adhere to the conservative party to some extent, but in another 10 or

1390
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:25,800
20 years, most of the conservative party line is just going to be over.

1391
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:26,800
It's going to be gone.

1392
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,480
It's going to have no relevance.

1393
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:30,640
Conservative party, you're talking about Republicans?

1394
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:32,640
Yeah, the conservative Republicans.

1395
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:33,640
Yeah.

1396
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:35,160
It's going to be pretty much over.

1397
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:40,240
There's a couple of young people who are kind of still carrying the line, but like, or toeing

1398
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:44,600
the line, I guess, but it's, it's not going to have influence.

1399
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:49,400
The religious people are going to gravitate towards, if anything, I think like a version

1400
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:55,940
of like Orthodox Christianity, which is like an Eastern form of Christianity.

1401
01:31:55,940 --> 01:32:02,080
But the whole neocon thing is politically just so reprehensible.

1402
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:05,280
I think it's going to be over very soon.

1403
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:09,720
I mean, that's my, my take on it at least, but you mentioned six season revolution and

1404
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:15,120
all that in the series of books that I also like to mention in this conversation is the

1405
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:21,320
psychedelic experience by Timothy Leary and manual based on the Tibetan book of the dead.

1406
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:27,920
It's really interesting, especially if you read it on acid, quite a journey.

1407
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:33,120
He's the guy, you know, he, uh, his, his, uh, have you read his autobiography?

1408
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,120
I don't think so.

1409
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:36,600
No, no, it has the best title.

1410
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:37,600
It's flashbacks.

1411
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:39,600
That's the title of it.

1412
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:40,600
It's so funny.

1413
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:46,440
It makes me laugh every time I think about it, flashbacks, super funny.

1414
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:50,080
Do you, um, do you feel politically homeless?

1415
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:51,800
Oh, for sure.

1416
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:58,040
I mean, in some way I, at the same time, I'm not super political.

1417
01:32:58,040 --> 01:33:04,240
I guess I, the one way, you know, watching these podcasts is very heartening to me.

1418
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:09,400
I think that it's not political yet, but like all there's a lot of podcasts, Joe Rogan,

1419
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:15,680
Jordan Peterson, you know, Jocko Willink, these guys who are kind of, you know, right

1420
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:20,840
leaning in some ways, but not necessarily they had, they're open to a lot of different

1421
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:22,960
ideas and ways of looking at the world.

1422
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:23,960
Yeah.

1423
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:26,560
They look right leaning because the left has gone insane.

1424
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,560
Yes, precisely.

1425
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:29,560
Yes.

1426
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:30,560
Yes.

1427
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:34,640
And, um, yeah, the, I mean, there is no left anymore.

1428
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:36,200
I mean, there really isn't.

1429
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:39,720
It's just, these are just corporate sphuges is all it is and liberty.

1430
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:40,720
That's what it is.

1431
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:41,720
Yeah.

1432
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:42,720
It's amazing.

1433
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:43,720
It's amazing to me.

1434
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:45,680
I mean, I live in Minneapolis, so I mean, it's amazing to me.

1435
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:50,320
What I've, what I've seen is just like, it's just amazing.

1436
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:56,920
Like how ridiculous the whole, you know, BLM crap is, it's just so ridiculous.

1437
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:57,920
They're corporate stooges.

1438
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:02,360
I mean, this organization is paid for by these international organizations.

1439
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:08,960
It's I mean, leftism used to be about contesting authority and contesting, uh, corporate authority

1440
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:09,960
and overreach.

1441
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:12,040
And it has nothing to do with that anymore.

1442
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:13,040
It's all about towing.

1443
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:14,040
Yeah.

1444
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:15,040
It's bizarre.

1445
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:17,040
It's totally bizarre.

1446
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:18,040
Yeah.

1447
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:19,040
And I don't know, man.

1448
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:23,960
I mean, one thing I'm optimistic about is that there's lots of like, you know, uh, mixed

1449
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:28,720
race and minority people who are openly speaking out against this, like, yo, this does not

1450
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:31,200
represent me at all.

1451
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:32,920
And that is a good sign.

1452
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:36,440
Like the democratic party has totally alienated itself.

1453
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:40,040
Um, and yeah, I'd prefer the conservative view on things.

1454
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:44,720
I just wish they'd be a little bit less, uh, insane about some of their biblical positions.

1455
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:49,120
I think that is, I literally think that there's a mental illness and conservativism.

1456
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:51,400
That's just, that is just crazy.

1457
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:56,600
Well, I mean, any kind of a fundamentalism, you know, this is a part of the story that

1458
01:34:56,600 --> 01:35:01,920
children who went to pleasure Island have begun turning into donkeys.

1459
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:06,220
So some people are saying that, Hey, the solution is in the belly of the whale.

1460
01:35:06,220 --> 01:35:10,400
So we got to go back to the belly of the whale, where, which is, you know, fundamentalism

1461
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:11,400
and all those things.

1462
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:17,680
But these people forget that Pinocchio and Geppetto got out of the whale by lighting

1463
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:21,040
the fire and fire is a piece of technology.

1464
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:24,840
So they ignore that part altogether that, Hey, we got to get to the whale and we got

1465
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:25,840
to be safe.

1466
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:28,080
No, you're not going to be saved.

1467
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:29,080
That's a problem.

1468
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:35,120
But when you hold onto something in this ocean of uncertainty that we're swimming in, you

1469
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:37,880
know, you're holding onto it because you need a sense of identity.

1470
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:39,600
You need a sense of purpose.

1471
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:42,440
You need a sense of direction, ethics and morality.

1472
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:46,560
And I think that is completely outdated and broken.

1473
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:52,000
The way that we have treated it in a conventional sense of the way and psychedelics again, I'm

1474
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,200
not suggesting anybody to do it or not do it.

1475
01:35:55,200 --> 01:36:01,020
I I've done it many, many times for many, many years and it's done wonders for me.

1476
01:36:01,020 --> 01:36:05,360
But I also had experiences that I could consider, you know, bad trips or whatever, but they

1477
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:06,360
were all tough ones.

1478
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:07,360
Yeah.

1479
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:08,760
It's all part of the puzzle.

1480
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:13,720
You know, you realize that in hindsight that actually I'm glad that I went through that

1481
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:14,720
kind of experience.

1482
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:15,720
Exactly.

1483
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:16,720
Yeah, for sure.

1484
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:17,720
Yep.

1485
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:18,720
Yep.

1486
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:22,120
It's it's part of the process of learning how to handle it too.

1487
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:26,520
And because, you know, especially those first ones, I think are real tough for people because

1488
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:27,920
we're indoctrinated in our culture.

1489
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:30,320
I mean, we're totally fed bull crap.

1490
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:35,320
And so those first encounters you have with psychedelics are going to challenge you for

1491
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:41,320
sure, because it's it's going to show you how much this our society is bullshit.

1492
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:47,040
I mean, it's I mean, at least that's that's kind of my reflection on my earlier experiences

1493
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:52,200
was that it really kind of it was kind of disassociative in some ways.

1494
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:55,800
But once you kind of work through it and I took a break from it for a while and I kind

1495
01:36:55,800 --> 01:37:00,520
of reflected on it, I realized, you know, like, yeah, there's a lot of stuff that I

1496
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:06,360
do in my personal life that's just like attached to this like fake cultural edifice, you know,

1497
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:10,280
that that I don't need to do, you know.

1498
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:14,760
So it's a part is a part of everyone's own process.

1499
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:17,120
And it's something that you have to figure out for yourself and you got to be kind of

1500
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:18,560
brave if you're going to do it.

1501
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:23,080
And so do your research, read Terrence McKenna, you know, that's that's a good place to start,

1502
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:24,080
at least.

1503
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:25,080
Yeah, really.

1504
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:30,640
McKenna and Alan Watts, I went through a couple of years of just these two.

1505
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:34,800
If I want to consider anybody as my guru, I don't believe in that concept, but these

1506
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:35,800
two would be it.

1507
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:36,800
You know, it's just.

1508
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:37,800
Yeah.

1509
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:38,800
Same.

1510
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:39,800
Yeah.

1511
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:40,800
Same.

1512
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:41,800
Yeah.

1513
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:42,800
Terrence, for me, for sure.

1514
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:43,800
Yeah.

1515
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:44,800
Yeah.

1516
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:45,800
How old were you when you had your first experience?

1517
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:46,800
And with what substance?

1518
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:47,800
I was 18.

1519
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:51,200
And I took some LSD with a couple of friends.

1520
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:53,560
Yeah, it was pretty interesting.

1521
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:57,600
I was in art school, so it's you know, it was kind of all around there.

1522
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:58,600
Yeah.

1523
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:04,000
So in LSD, I found to be a little bit more aggressive than psilocybin.

1524
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:11,200
I think psilocybin is a lot less aggressive and a lot less analytical as well.

1525
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:14,080
LSD is very analytical.

1526
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:17,800
So I think psilocybin is probably a better first run.

1527
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:21,840
If I could go back and change, I probably would have done psilocybin first just to kind

1528
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:25,560
of warm up a little bit because LSD is just, I found it to be really intense.

1529
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:26,560
But yeah.

1530
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:27,560
All right.

1531
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:36,360
Adam's book is called Eden and Enthugen, Psychedelic History from the Bronze Age to the 1960s.

1532
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:40,520
It's available for free on archive.org.

1533
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:45,160
And I'm showing you guys now that you can flip through the pages digitally and you can

1534
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:48,440
even listen to it being read by an AI voice.

1535
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:51,240
Are you aware of that on archive.org?

1536
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:52,240
I did not know that.

1537
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:55,880
It's just like auto, auto-generated voice.

1538
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:56,880
Is that new?

1539
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:58,600
I hadn't even tried that.

1540
01:38:58,600 --> 01:38:59,600
Yeah.

1541
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:00,600
Interesting.

1542
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:02,440
I just tested it before coming on.

1543
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:03,440
Oh, okay.

1544
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:05,240
So yeah, it's working.

1545
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:10,160
Hey, what were some of the main sources of your research for the book?

1546
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:15,360
Well, basically, the majority of the book is actually a commentary just on Old Testament

1547
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:16,360
verses.

1548
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:17,960
So you'll see an Old Testament verse.

1549
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:22,400
I'll give some commentary on it, and it's just to cruise you through like a couple hundred

1550
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:28,440
years of biblical history and just give all the important psychedelic moments and points

1551
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:31,960
and kind of tie it back to Terrence McKenna.

1552
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:35,160
There's a couple other people that I reference periodically.

1553
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:38,320
One of my favorites is Michael Hudson.

1554
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:39,960
He's a Minnesotan too.

1555
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:45,860
Michael Hudson did this scholarship on ancient Sumerian economies.

1556
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:53,040
And basically, he did this Harvard study with these Harvard researchers, and they analyzed

1557
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:58,600
the cuneiform tablets, and they figured out how the economy in these ancient Sumerian

1558
01:39:58,600 --> 01:39:59,600
city-states worked.

1559
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:04,680
And it's really interesting.

1560
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:07,160
It's very counterintuitive how it worked.

1561
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:08,160
It's really interesting.

1562
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:12,620
And so I incorporate a little bit of that into the book of how these ancient temple

1563
01:40:12,620 --> 01:40:16,640
complex cultures manage their economies, because they had managed economies.

1564
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:19,760
It wasn't like barter and trade or anything like that.

1565
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:23,160
The ancient Sumerians had priests, and they set prices.

1566
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:27,740
And the temple was also a storehouse, as well as a place where they took psychedelics.

1567
01:40:27,740 --> 01:40:33,920
So it was this all-purpose marketplace, government headquarters, religious temple, is really

1568
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:39,400
an interesting way of managing a society, really.

1569
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:44,160
And it kind of all makes sense that that's actually where markets originated.

1570
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:49,880
It was in these temples, in these storehouses, where you stored grain, where you stored precious

1571
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:53,820
metals, you stored all kinds and fabrics as well.

1572
01:40:53,820 --> 01:40:57,840
And that it was psychedelic people who, again, were managing this.

1573
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:01,920
He doesn't do the psychedelic thing, but I tie it into my general analysis of how the

1574
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:02,920
Bible worked.

1575
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:04,880
And it just makes sense that you'd have...

1576
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:06,520
These were religious centers as well.

1577
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:10,040
So yes, of course, you're going to have these people taking these drugs there.

1578
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:16,420
So I tie my theories into some prominent scholars like Michael Hudson in unique ways that haven't

1579
01:41:16,420 --> 01:41:20,200
really been done yet, but I don't know.

1580
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:21,720
It's a little bit dense, and it's really just...

1581
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:26,040
It's kind of for the academic heads up there in some ways.

1582
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:27,560
And you're working on a new book.

1583
01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:28,560
Yeah.

1584
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:33,000
The second one is a follow-up, because this book is 600 pages, but it just gets up to

1585
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,240
the Book of First Kings in the Old Testament.

1586
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:42,880
So the next book is going to really cruise through Christianity, Islam, colonial America,

1587
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:46,840
and some of the Greek and Roman legends as well, because you have psychedelic stuff going

1588
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:47,840
on there.

1589
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:52,640
So what the point is, is to show the continuity of the psychedelic system of government that

1590
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:59,400
starts with Terence McKenna's nomads, and then it turns into ancient Egypt, and then

1591
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:03,880
you get the Israelites, and then you kind of just kind of follow the thing through.

1592
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:06,720
And you can see this culture emerging and re-emerging.

1593
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:08,760
It's really, really interesting.

1594
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:14,080
And I think you can follow points of collapse when people abandon this lifestyle of taking

1595
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:18,480
these hallucinogens, because that's what keeps you in touch with reality in some way.

1596
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:21,880
Or at least you have to have a few people who are doing it periodically.

1597
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:24,040
It's not like they have to do it all the time.

1598
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:25,360
You just have to have that.

1599
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:29,360
You have to have some people who are reevaluating things and saying, okay, wait, maybe we're

1600
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:32,620
not doing things right here or there or whatever.

1601
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:37,480
So once the society becomes decadent, they stop caring about that kind of self-reflective

1602
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:40,640
instinct, that's when you get collapsed.

1603
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:42,200
I think that's what we're dealing with today.

1604
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:46,000
So I think it's totally relevant to what our society is going through.

1605
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Yeah.

1606
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:52,200
On the second book, so you're basically exploring the psychedelic systems of governance.

1607
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:57,760
Yeah, it gets a little bit more detailed because as you move forward in history, you get more

1608
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:59,600
records and references.

1609
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:02,920
One of the interesting things that I found recently was Mormonism.

1610
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:09,000
A lot of people, South Park, for example, did all kinds of jokes about Mormonism just

1611
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,320
being like literally insane.

1612
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:16,120
This guy's crazy, he had visions, God was talking to him.

1613
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:21,680
But looking at it again, it's just remarkable.

1614
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:25,120
The guy had these relationships with these Native Americans.

1615
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:30,720
He had these visionary experiences and it seems that he appropriated some of these interesting

1616
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:36,920
psychedelic symbols from the early colonial period and he was very much about herbal healing.

1617
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:44,040
He had an herbalist in his kind of cult and he was very much about herbal healing.

1618
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:50,520
There's some sculptural reliefs that indicate some different psychedelics.

1619
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:54,920
So saving some of that for the second book, it's really interesting, but you see it everywhere.

1620
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:59,840
If you really look for it, this is at the center of these religious movements and it's

1621
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:00,840
interesting.

1622
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:04,360
I mean, Utah now is like a totally kind of unique state.

1623
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:05,520
It's a Mormon state.

1624
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:08,640
It has its own governing principles.

1625
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:12,920
It has its own religious sense of orientation.

1626
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:18,000
So you have potential to do something like what Joseph Smith did and recreate some kind

1627
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:21,240
of cultural renaissance with psychedelics.

1628
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:26,760
So you can kind of look at these historical figures and you can model some potential outcome

1629
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:31,360
of a new emergent kind of civilization.

1630
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:36,760
So it's kind of interesting to read through history that way and see those models, I think.

1631
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:41,640
Mormons are very interesting because of the way that they define God, that God is basically

1632
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:45,200
an enlightened man, so anybody can become a God.

1633
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:53,960
And because of that, they also have Mormon transhumanist association.

1634
01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:58,480
The more fundamentalist Mormons, they're not very friendly towards them.

1635
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:05,840
So it's not like they're united, but this definition of the core, their God has allowed

1636
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:11,680
for a lot of different innovation for lack of a better word within that context, within

1637
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:14,040
that religious context.

1638
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:15,200
Right.

1639
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:16,760
It's such an interesting religion.

1640
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:21,480
I mean, some of the stuff that they believe is just so far out, I just laugh every time

1641
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:22,480
I just...

1642
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:27,020
I mean, one of the things was, apparently Joseph Smith said that there were people living

1643
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:30,640
on the moon that looked like Quakers who are like...

1644
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:31,640
It doesn't surprise me.

1645
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:32,640
Yeah.

1646
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:37,000
He's like said the craziest things and I'm like, yes, exactly.

1647
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:41,360
I've thought about converting to Mormonism just because it's so awesome, it's so out

1648
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:43,040
there and so crazy.

1649
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:44,040
It's great.

1650
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:45,040
I think it's so funny.

1651
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:50,720
Hey, Adam, where can our audience follow your work?

1652
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:54,600
And you already said what's next for you because that's also the question that I ask along

1653
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:55,600
with this one.

1654
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:56,600
Right.

1655
01:45:56,600 --> 01:46:00,520
Next for you is your new book and where can people follow your future works and future

1656
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:01,520
endeavors?

1657
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:04,560
Well, I upload onto Internet Archive.

1658
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:10,000
So you can follow me on Internet Archive if you just look up Eden and Entheogens there.

1659
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,760
That's basically where I upload all my stuff.

1660
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:17,840
So if you want to keep in touch and read the book or whatever, you can comment there too.

1661
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:22,160
And there's also an email address in the...

1662
01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:28,600
Like on one of the first pages of the book, Eden and Entheogens at protonmail.com, I think.

1663
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:30,480
So yeah.

1664
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:32,720
So that's probably the best way to get in touch if you want to.

1665
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:34,520
I'm not like super savvy with social media.

1666
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:39,200
I do it a little bit, but I'm not like, I don't know, I'm not building a following or

1667
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:42,120
building anything like that.

1668
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:43,360
Well this was awesome, man.

1669
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:46,960
Thanks for coming up and thanks for reaching out.

1670
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:49,640
Hopefully I'll have you back for your second book.

1671
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:53,800
We talk about the images and some more that you sent as well.

1672
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:55,720
Yeah, that'd be cool, man.

1673
01:46:55,720 --> 01:46:56,720
Yeah.

1674
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:57,720
I had a great time.

1675
01:46:57,720 --> 01:46:58,720
Thanks for having me on.

1676
01:46:58,720 --> 01:46:59,720
Yeah.

1677
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:01,880
Let me ask you the final question I ask all my guests.

1678
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:06,240
If you come across an intelligent alien from a different civilization, what would you say

1679
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:14,720
is the worst thing humanity has done and what would you say is their greatest achievement?

1680
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:15,720
That's such a hard question.

1681
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:20,080
I don't know, because I don't like to do the absolutes too much.

1682
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:24,840
The worst thing, oh my gosh, just, I don't know, the past 50 years of American culture

1683
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:29,920
and civilization basically since they destroyed the 1960s I think is probably one of the worst

1684
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:32,720
things that's ever happened.

1685
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:37,320
It's just spiritually it's just decimated so much.

1686
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:41,480
People are smart and they find a way to work around it, but yeah, there's been a really

1687
01:47:41,480 --> 01:47:46,800
severe system of control in place I think basically since the Nixon administration at

1688
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:47,800
the very least.

1689
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:51,760
I think it probably goes back a little further, but that's the worst.

1690
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:57,880
The best thing that we've ever produced, oh man, that's a tough question.

1691
01:47:57,880 --> 01:48:02,760
I think it's part of the size of the 1960s, but I think computers are just marvelous.

1692
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:06,760
I just think computers are just incredible.

1693
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:11,640
Some of the coolest things as far as material things we've produced, I'd say computers,

1694
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:16,040
but also I might say classical architecture because I just thought I love classical architecture,

1695
01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:35,720
so somewhere in between there, yeah.

1696
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:53,080
Thank you.
