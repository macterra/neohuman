WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.320
Really, the big thing that has kind of been a part of my thinking for a long time and

00:05.320 --> 00:12.320
something I put in the book pretty prominently is how do we build a better government that

00:12.320 --> 00:15.760
doesn't do the things that we have going on today?

00:15.760 --> 00:18.180
How did the ancient people build their governments?

00:18.180 --> 00:20.640
Because they had to figure it out somehow.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.600
What was the organizational principle?

00:22.600 --> 00:28.360
What were they doing when they were establishing the Athenian Senate?

00:28.360 --> 00:32.920
What was the impetus that made them do this and create these institutions?

00:32.920 --> 00:43.240
I think the psychedelic drugs are a big part of that.

00:43.240 --> 00:47.600
Adam Dresche, welcome to Neo Human Podcast, episode 93.

00:47.600 --> 00:49.600
93, huh?

00:49.600 --> 00:50.600
All right, sweet.

00:50.600 --> 00:51.600
Thanks for having me.

00:51.600 --> 00:52.600
I appreciate it, bro.

00:52.600 --> 00:54.200
What does that number mean to you?

00:54.200 --> 00:59.680
Because you're kind of a person who looks a little deeper into things than general public.

00:59.680 --> 01:03.640
Yeah, no numerology on my side.

01:03.640 --> 01:11.160
Adam actually reached me on Twitter after the interview with Jason Giorgiani.

01:11.160 --> 01:12.160
Yeah.

01:12.160 --> 01:14.160
That was a great interview.

01:14.160 --> 01:15.160
I really enjoyed that.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.160
Thanks, man.

01:16.160 --> 01:19.080
It's always a pleasure talking to him.

01:19.080 --> 01:23.000
You mentioned your book, which we're definitely going to talk about today.

01:23.000 --> 01:30.560
It's called Eden and Entheogens, Psychedelic History from the Bronze Age to the 1960s.

01:30.560 --> 01:33.040
This is a book that is available for free.

01:33.040 --> 01:38.840
I believe that this is a result of 10-year long research, as you mentioned.

01:38.840 --> 01:39.840
Yeah.

01:39.840 --> 01:41.680
I've been kind of working on it.

01:41.680 --> 01:44.720
I've been serious about it for the past year or two.

01:44.720 --> 01:48.120
I spent about 10 years on it.

01:48.120 --> 01:49.120
All right.

01:49.120 --> 01:52.120
We've got to get to all of that, but let's start with your background.

01:52.120 --> 01:56.400
The lives you live, the work you've done, and what are you mainly focused on now these

01:56.400 --> 01:57.400
days?

01:57.400 --> 01:58.400
Right.

01:58.400 --> 01:59.400
Yeah.

01:59.400 --> 02:07.640
So basically, I kind of grew up in a pretty Christian conservative community.

02:07.640 --> 02:12.880
Went to a Lutheran school, my home state here in Minnesota.

02:12.880 --> 02:17.120
That's kind of like what introduced me to the Bible and kind of got me curious about

02:17.120 --> 02:19.880
biblical stories.

02:19.880 --> 02:26.800
Grew up and then actually went to an art school, so that kind of went the other way.

02:26.800 --> 02:31.400
Basically I studied music for a while.

02:31.400 --> 02:36.920
After graduating from art school, I was just kind of disaffected with just a lot of things

02:36.920 --> 02:44.320
in society and a lot of things that I just didn't agree with about the way our country

02:44.320 --> 02:46.720
is kind of going.

02:46.720 --> 02:52.000
I kind of became more conservative after graduating from art school and I've been kind of back

02:52.000 --> 02:55.640
and forth between the two.

02:55.640 --> 03:00.560
That's kind of like my educational background, I guess.

03:00.560 --> 03:06.000
Then since then, it's basically been, I just kind of do a lot of reading and a lot of research

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
on my own time.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.840
I'm kind of independent, so I don't have a publisher.

03:10.840 --> 03:18.840
I published my book independently on the Internet Archive.

03:18.840 --> 03:22.880
Basically I do things myself, pretty much.

03:22.880 --> 03:28.680
I work odd jobs and do stuff like that, so yeah, that's kind of my background, I guess.

03:28.680 --> 03:31.520
What year was it that you graduated from art school?

03:31.520 --> 03:33.520
That was in 2010.

03:33.520 --> 03:34.520
2010?

03:34.520 --> 03:35.520
Yep.

03:35.520 --> 03:42.000
I think that period is a period of red pilling for a lot of people and awakening for a lot

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
of people.

03:43.000 --> 03:49.000
I mean, Bitcoin came in 2008 and then 2012, 2013 seems like a lot of people began to waken

03:49.000 --> 03:54.120
up to seeing outside of this matrix because this is what it is.

03:54.120 --> 03:55.120
Totally.

03:55.120 --> 03:56.120
Yeah.

03:56.120 --> 04:02.880
I mean, Alex Jones was definitely part of my waking up journey for sure, because he was

04:02.880 --> 04:06.200
just an animated guy and it was just so bizarre.

04:06.200 --> 04:08.400
I just thought he was such an interesting dude.

04:08.400 --> 04:09.400
Yeah.

04:09.400 --> 04:12.160
There's a meme factory, walking meme factory.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.160
Totally.

04:13.160 --> 04:14.160
Yeah, totally.

04:14.160 --> 04:15.720
Well, I found it interesting.

04:15.720 --> 04:24.520
You shared a meme with me earlier today, kind of paving the way for this interview.

04:24.520 --> 04:28.800
Basically I was thinking about how I can describe it to people who are listening and not watching

04:28.800 --> 04:29.800
it.

04:29.800 --> 04:34.120
It doesn't need to be described, you know, it related meaning that you were basically

04:34.120 --> 04:38.440
surprised that somebody would say that, yeah, bro, come and talk about your book on my podcast.

04:38.440 --> 04:39.440
When are you ready?

04:39.440 --> 04:40.440
Right.

04:40.440 --> 04:41.440
Yeah, exactly.

04:41.440 --> 04:42.440
Yeah.

04:42.440 --> 04:48.360
So, yeah, because I reach out to a lot of people and I see, you know, I just kind of throw

04:48.360 --> 04:49.360
it out there.

04:49.360 --> 04:50.360
I'm like, look, I wrote this book.

04:50.360 --> 04:53.240
It's kind of working with Terrence McKenna's ideas.

04:53.240 --> 04:57.960
You might be interested in this and so I don't hear back from a lot of people basically,

04:57.960 --> 05:00.240
but you know, I send it out there at least just to put it out there.

05:00.240 --> 05:04.280
So when I do get a response, I'm always just like super excited about it because I think,

05:04.280 --> 05:08.600
I don't know, I just think Terrence McKenna is a little bit like under regarded as a kind

05:08.600 --> 05:11.520
of, I mean, as a serious thinker.

05:11.520 --> 05:16.920
I think, you know, he's kind of in kind of meme territory right now in the kind of popular

05:16.920 --> 05:17.920
culture.

05:17.920 --> 05:22.340
I mean, he does have some kind of like, you know, he gets some accolades from people like

05:22.340 --> 05:24.760
Rogan and stuff, which is good.

05:24.760 --> 05:29.040
But I just think there's more to kind of dig into about like things that he said and kind

05:29.040 --> 05:34.640
of his line of thinking, I think is super relevant about getting to like a very originalist

05:34.640 --> 05:39.000
idea of, you know, where do human beings come from?

05:39.000 --> 05:43.160
What is that kind of natural state of government for us?

05:43.160 --> 05:47.440
And you know, even a natural state of religion, perhaps, that he kind of touches on that,

05:47.440 --> 05:50.680
I think in Food of the Gods and some other books.

05:50.680 --> 05:56.280
And you know, he's definitely kind of a part of that 1960s milieu and that cultural kind

05:56.280 --> 05:58.120
of Renaissance that happened.

05:58.120 --> 06:03.200
And I just, I think that, you know, more of that I think would be very beneficial for

06:03.200 --> 06:08.360
American culture because I think you have, you have right now, you have people kind of

06:08.360 --> 06:11.800
being kind of divided off into these kind of party groups.

06:11.800 --> 06:19.240
And it's just that real like spirit of common good that was kind of alive in the 60s and

06:19.240 --> 06:23.320
that Terrence McKenna kind of worked with and built off of, seems to me to be something

06:23.320 --> 06:25.920
that, you know, we can learn a lot from.

06:25.920 --> 06:30.560
And so that's one reason why I respect Terrence a lot and also because just the content of

06:30.560 --> 06:32.360
his books I think are really interesting.

06:32.360 --> 06:36.960
Yeah, the description of your book on your Twitter is that they discovered the relationship

06:36.960 --> 06:42.280
between Stone-Dape theory and the Bible with my new book, Eden and Inclusion is now available

06:42.280 --> 06:44.500
free of charge on the Internet Archive.

06:44.500 --> 06:45.920
So let's get right to it.

06:45.920 --> 06:50.880
First of all, what inspired you to begin this research into psychedelics and Bible?

06:50.880 --> 06:55.760
You mentioned that you got interested in Bible as a child.

06:55.760 --> 06:58.720
I kind of share that kind of interest in religion.

06:58.720 --> 07:04.600
I grew up in Iran and I had, I had few years of getting really into Shiism, but in the

07:04.600 --> 07:10.280
mystical part of it, you know, just the whole feeling and atmosphere around it, you know,

07:10.280 --> 07:12.880
you don't even care whether or not the stories are true.

07:12.880 --> 07:13.880
Yeah, right.

07:13.880 --> 07:18.120
There's, yeah, there's kind of, yeah, there's a romance to these religions, I think, in

07:18.120 --> 07:19.120
a way.

07:19.120 --> 07:21.320
There's a very romantic vision of these religions.

07:21.320 --> 07:26.160
And yeah, I don't know if you were part of the Sufi schools at all, but yeah, I'm kind

07:26.160 --> 07:27.160
of interested.

07:27.160 --> 07:32.560
I've had Sufi friends, they've been around, but you know, Iran, because of the kind of

07:32.560 --> 07:38.760
theocracy that they have, a total monopoly, no one else basically has the right to express

07:38.760 --> 07:46.200
themselves except a very small circle of Shia clerics and the militants who are, you know,

07:46.200 --> 07:48.840
might very well be the next, the future of that country.

07:48.840 --> 07:49.840
Right.

07:49.840 --> 07:50.840
Yeah, I mean, yeah, you don't know.

07:50.840 --> 07:53.000
I mean, it's kind of chaos over there.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Yeah.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.920
But you know, it's human nature because what happened there can very well happens here.

07:58.920 --> 08:00.720
Oh, yeah, totally.

08:00.720 --> 08:01.720
100%.

08:01.720 --> 08:05.800
I mean, yeah, I mean, actually, I do have a kind of Islamic background too, which I

08:05.800 --> 08:06.800
didn't really touch on.

08:06.800 --> 08:09.120
Yeah, my dad's from Morocco, actually.

08:09.120 --> 08:12.280
So yeah, so he kind of comes from a Muslim family.

08:12.280 --> 08:14.080
He's not so much Muslim himself.

08:14.080 --> 08:18.800
He kind of came over to the United States to kind of get away from the Islamic world,

08:18.800 --> 08:20.120
so to speak.

08:20.120 --> 08:25.320
And yeah, so, you know, he's pretty new age, I guess, my dad in his own way, but he's still

08:25.320 --> 08:27.120
also very traditional.

08:27.120 --> 08:33.900
So yeah, so I mean, so yeah, I kind of, I'm very interested in the Islamic world too.

08:33.900 --> 08:38.280
Not just like the biblical kind of Christian Jewish stories, but the Islamic stories, I

08:38.280 --> 08:42.720
mean, they're all very interconnected, interrelated to a large extent.

08:42.720 --> 08:49.100
And I see potential for de-escalation of conflict between these religions in kind of developing

08:49.100 --> 08:53.600
a unified kind of framework of how to interpret them.

08:53.600 --> 08:58.880
And one way that I do that is with Terrence McKenna and by identifying areas in the Bible

08:58.880 --> 09:05.280
and areas in Islam as well, where you have evidence of hallucinogenic drug use.

09:05.280 --> 09:12.000
And it's very, it's a very interesting kind of argument to make, because it kind of undermines

09:12.000 --> 09:16.560
a lot of the kind of authoritarian versions of these religions today.

09:16.560 --> 09:21.440
When you can point to places in the Bible that like, it's almost obvious that these

09:21.440 --> 09:23.800
people are using hallucinogenic drugs.

09:23.800 --> 09:25.880
This is what real fundamentalism looks like.

09:25.880 --> 09:29.480
It looks like Woodstock in the 1960s, and we can get into some of those stories and

09:29.480 --> 09:31.920
examples if you want to.

09:31.920 --> 09:36.640
But it's really, it's an interesting way of looking at the Bible to say, you know, you

09:36.640 --> 09:41.960
go back to the Bronze Age in the time of King David, you know, close to 1000 BC.

09:41.960 --> 09:48.280
I mean, it's not like, you know, Judaism today, you know, in Israel or, you know, in the United

09:48.280 --> 09:51.740
States, it's nothing like that.

09:51.740 --> 09:53.620
It's a war cult.

09:53.620 --> 09:59.240
When they're taking drugs, they're kind of have this very ecstatic sense of music.

09:59.240 --> 10:04.680
And that's a big part of their temple worship is this music thing going on.

10:04.680 --> 10:06.400
David was a songwriter himself.

10:06.400 --> 10:10.600
The Psalms are supposedly written by King David.

10:10.600 --> 10:16.040
So you have this really interesting psychedelic culture that is just obvious to anybody who

10:16.040 --> 10:18.920
reads it through the eyes of like the 1960s.

10:18.920 --> 10:21.240
You can just see very clearly these people are very different.

10:21.240 --> 10:23.080
They venerate sex and fertility.

10:23.080 --> 10:29.600
It's like, so they're coming out of this very archaic religion and culture that was centered

10:29.600 --> 10:31.920
around, I mean, drug sex and rock and roll.

10:31.920 --> 10:34.480
I mean, it's kind of the way that you can frame it.

10:34.480 --> 10:38.480
And I think it's funny to look at it this way in a certain way.

10:38.480 --> 10:42.040
But it's also, I mean, it's a serious argument too.

10:42.040 --> 10:46.080
So that's kind of how I frame and set up my scholarship.

10:46.080 --> 10:49.120
And it's just become more and more apparent to me the more I've looked at it.

10:49.120 --> 10:53.240
Like this is really kind of the best way to interpret what these religions are about and

10:53.240 --> 10:55.880
what they were really like in the early days.

10:55.880 --> 10:59.200
It's different now because the traditions get passed down.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.460
People stop taking the hallucinogens.

11:01.460 --> 11:06.760
There's new rules invented and made up over the years and you get these dogmatic kind

11:06.760 --> 11:09.680
of monoliths of these religions.

11:09.680 --> 11:16.120
But going back and doing that examination of the earliest form I think is very helpful

11:16.120 --> 11:22.560
for maybe not necessarily reviving a kind of archaic Abrahamic religion, but maybe even

11:22.560 --> 11:25.160
just imagining what a new religion would look like.

11:25.160 --> 11:27.600
Because these people invented these religions back then.

11:27.600 --> 11:33.000
They were invented by people like Moses and Jesus and according to the biblical scriptures.

11:33.000 --> 11:38.720
Some people say Jesus might not be real, Moses might not be real, but I mean, yeah.

11:38.720 --> 11:43.240
I picked a couple of books to also mention throughout this conversation.

11:43.240 --> 11:48.400
One of them is The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross by John Alec Rose, Study of the Nature

11:48.400 --> 11:52.480
and the Origin of Christianity within the Fertility Cult of Ancient Near East.

11:52.480 --> 12:00.100
He argues Jesus was a mushroom and people were taking him and having these experiences.

12:00.100 --> 12:07.120
Is that really weirder than believing the status quo story of Jesus or believing the

12:07.120 --> 12:09.840
status quo story of, for example, Scientology?

12:09.840 --> 12:14.240
Because anybody who has had any kind of a psychedelic experience can be like, yeah,

12:14.240 --> 12:15.240
I totally get it.

12:15.240 --> 12:18.880
I totally get how you can't have religious experiences on psychedelics.

12:18.880 --> 12:19.880
Precisely.

12:19.880 --> 12:22.320
I mean, yeah.

12:22.320 --> 12:27.440
In all the other world religions, I mean, you can kind of see in paganism, in South

12:27.440 --> 12:34.400
American shamanism, you see this use of these kind of plant drugs for this purpose.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.480
It makes sense that we'd find this in the indigenous traditions in the Middle East as

12:37.480 --> 12:38.480
well.

12:38.480 --> 12:44.880
It just makes sense that that's what you'd find there.

12:44.880 --> 12:46.680
For me, I mean, that's what I've seen.

12:46.680 --> 12:49.520
The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross is very interesting.

12:49.520 --> 12:53.920
I do have a piece about that book in my book as well.

12:53.920 --> 13:01.040
Basically, I have a minor dispute with Allegro and R. Gordon Wasson.

13:01.040 --> 13:06.600
They kind of hyper-focused on a particular mushroom, the Amanita mushrooms, if you're

13:06.600 --> 13:07.600
familiar.

13:07.600 --> 13:10.440
They're red mushrooms with those white spots on them.

13:10.440 --> 13:13.480
They're kind of associated with Santa Claus and kind of Northern European, kind of pagan.

13:13.480 --> 13:18.360
I was going to say, a very significant role in culture all across basically.

13:18.360 --> 13:20.360
Yeah, right, right.

13:20.360 --> 13:24.880
It's kind of a European mushroom that Europeans are very familiar with.

13:24.880 --> 13:28.320
When you get these European scholars going to the Middle East and looking at the Dead

13:28.320 --> 13:32.600
Sea Scrolls, looking at these things, what they end up doing is they kind of associate

13:32.600 --> 13:36.160
it to a mushroom that they're familiar with, which is the Amanitas, because that's kind

13:36.160 --> 13:39.680
of common in their kind of cultural milieu.

13:39.680 --> 13:41.360
There's some other reasons that I get to in my book.

13:41.360 --> 13:45.480
You can read it if you want to dive in there.

13:45.480 --> 13:50.360
Basically, scholars didn't really recognize that psilocybin mushrooms were present in

13:50.360 --> 13:51.360
the Middle East for a long time.

13:51.360 --> 13:54.000
They thought it was a South American thing.

13:54.000 --> 13:59.680
All through the 50s, 60s, 70s, since Gordon Wasson went to South America, they thought,

13:59.680 --> 14:01.280
okay, these are South American mushrooms.

14:01.280 --> 14:03.720
They're different, but actually, they're all over.

14:03.720 --> 14:09.440
They're in India, they're in Indonesia, they're all over the place because these spores can

14:09.440 --> 14:14.200
just travel.

14:14.200 --> 14:20.480
It's very likely that the mushrooms talked about in the ancient Jewish and the ancient

14:20.480 --> 14:26.000
Christian tradition might actually... They might have had Amanitas, but they might have

14:26.000 --> 14:29.600
also had psilocybin mushrooms as well.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.720
There's probably allusions to opium in various places as well.

14:32.720 --> 14:37.600
There's this big kind of drug concoction actually that was relevant to that region and to that

14:37.600 --> 14:40.720
area at that time.

14:40.720 --> 14:45.600
That's my one dispute I have with Allegro.

14:45.600 --> 14:46.720
Jesus is very interesting.

14:46.720 --> 14:51.540
The whole notion that Jesus was a mushroom, I think that Allegro gets this from the book

14:51.540 --> 14:57.320
of John in the New Testament because basically what Jesus says is he says, I am the manna

14:57.320 --> 14:58.800
of the ancient Israelites.

14:58.800 --> 15:03.360
The manna is like this weird thing that comes out of a fog and it grows in the wilderness

15:03.360 --> 15:10.840
and it feeds the Israelites for 40 years and it basically tests their faith is what it

15:10.840 --> 15:13.200
says in the Old Testament.

15:13.200 --> 15:18.040
The manna was this weird religious sacraments that came out of a cloud of fog and that's

15:18.040 --> 15:20.760
really interesting because well, that's actually the conditions that are necessary for growing

15:20.760 --> 15:26.440
psilocybin mushrooms if you're in a warm moist climate.

15:26.440 --> 15:33.480
They really do a lot to identify that basically all the environmental conditions around them

15:33.480 --> 15:35.000
were suitable for growing mushrooms.

15:35.000 --> 15:43.160
When you read through Exodus 16, I do a really detailed analysis of this in my book.

15:43.160 --> 15:48.280
You probably have this, so Jesus saying, I am the manna, I am the mushrooms that the

15:48.280 --> 15:54.240
ancient Israelites used to eat in the wilderness, in some way I think he's actually tripped

15:54.240 --> 15:55.240
out on drugs.

15:55.240 --> 15:59.080
This is a real recording of something that he actually said.

15:59.080 --> 16:04.000
I think he's like trying to explain his trip in some way and he's just losing his mind.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.320
That's kind of the way that I frame it.

16:06.320 --> 16:08.520
A lot of New Testament is like that.

16:08.520 --> 16:09.520
Yes, exactly.

16:09.520 --> 16:10.520
Yeah.

16:10.520 --> 16:15.320
It's just like, and that's what these mystery traditions were, like the mystery schools

16:15.320 --> 16:20.980
in the ancient world where these kind of processes and these banquets where you would go and

16:20.980 --> 16:25.600
take psychedelics with a group of people and there'd be some kind of theatrical performance

16:25.600 --> 16:29.800
of some kind where somebody would give some kind of like rhetorical sermon or speech.

16:29.800 --> 16:36.560
It was meant to communicate like secret information about what was going on and kind of this occult

16:36.560 --> 16:38.040
kind of form of communication.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.840
It seems that Jesus was doing something like that.

16:40.840 --> 16:43.160
He was kind of personifying in some way.

16:43.160 --> 16:48.140
He's saying, I am the mushroom, you have to eat of my flesh, you have to drink my blood.

16:48.140 --> 16:51.600
It's like speaking as if he is a mushroom, if that makes sense.

16:51.600 --> 16:52.600
Yeah.

16:52.600 --> 16:59.260
I don't think it necessarily negates the possibility that Jesus was a historical person.

16:59.260 --> 17:08.440
On your last episode with Jason, you guys brought up Apollonius of Tiana, maybe is what

17:08.440 --> 17:09.440
it is.

17:09.440 --> 17:10.440
Yes, I believe so.

17:10.440 --> 17:11.440
Yeah.

17:11.440 --> 17:17.600
So yeah, possibly it was a syncretism between multiple personalities compiled into the Bible.

17:17.600 --> 17:21.780
The New Testament, in my opinion, is like the least historically credible of the three

17:21.780 --> 17:27.760
Abrahamic religions because it's produced by the Roman Empire, which was persecuting

17:27.760 --> 17:32.540
these rebellious Jews basically that Jesus was kind of intermixed with.

17:32.540 --> 17:38.160
So the credibility of the New Testament to me is the most suspect as a historical document.

17:38.160 --> 17:42.520
The Old Testament and Islamic literature, I think, are more credible.

17:42.520 --> 17:48.000
So I kind of focus more on that as far as my thinking is concerned.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Yeah.

17:49.000 --> 17:56.320
Islam has this forever sword basically on top of Koran that anybody that changes a single

17:56.320 --> 18:01.200
vow, that's basically a crime and it's the biggest sin you can commit.

18:01.200 --> 18:09.960
So it has stayed the way it has stayed after I think the third Khalif who took power after

18:09.960 --> 18:13.600
the prophet, basically because there were different versions of Koran, he gathered all

18:13.600 --> 18:20.920
of them, burned all of them and there was one that had remained as it is right now.

18:20.920 --> 18:24.440
Since you mentioned Jesus and what we were talking about, Jesus and psychedelics and

18:24.440 --> 18:32.200
all that, there's also a claim that Moses was high on DMT when he saw the burning bush.

18:32.200 --> 18:37.860
The problem is that, let me mention this also, that in Iran a religious authority has considered

18:37.860 --> 18:45.040
a psychedelic to be medicine and said that it's halal as one of the clerics.

18:45.040 --> 18:51.400
But you can totally see why there is a push all across in order to keep psychedelics away

18:51.400 --> 18:57.680
from individuals because there's a huge difference if you're even going to read the Bible, even

18:57.680 --> 19:03.800
going to read the New Testament, when you're experiencing some kind of a psychedelic state

19:03.800 --> 19:08.240
rather than every Sunday go to church and this is the outcome of it that more and more

19:08.240 --> 19:09.880
people are turned off by it.

19:09.880 --> 19:16.120
I have thousands of channels and you cannot catch up with that because I'm not going to

19:16.120 --> 19:19.280
get my morality from you because there are other people who are more famous than you

19:19.280 --> 19:22.000
and I look up to them.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.200
People have lost belief because you can't really force people to believe in something

19:26.200 --> 19:27.920
that they cannot experience.

19:27.920 --> 19:33.120
And I think this monopolization of experience is the biggest crime that has done to humanity

19:33.120 --> 19:38.080
that hey, you believe in Jesus, you believe in New Testament, go and read it but have

19:38.080 --> 19:43.400
the kind of an experience that will take you out of this frame that you call self, that

19:43.400 --> 19:46.200
you identify with, right?

19:46.200 --> 19:49.040
Yeah, definitely.

19:49.040 --> 19:56.680
I agree with those sentiments that the church today is not even what it was a hundred years

19:56.680 --> 19:57.680
ago.

19:57.680 --> 20:01.440
I mean, it's totally different.

20:01.440 --> 20:07.720
They could probably say that for all three of the Abrahamic religions.

20:07.720 --> 20:11.600
With technology, with these new personalities, these new leadership figures in our society

20:11.600 --> 20:15.960
and our culture and the direction of our culture, which is gravitating more towards personal

20:15.960 --> 20:20.360
experience and probably, I mean, really psychedelic drugs.

20:20.360 --> 20:26.400
I see this happening almost everywhere I look.

20:26.400 --> 20:32.520
These forms don't apply to this kind of paradigm in a big way.

20:32.520 --> 20:37.240
What you're saying about how people have other authorities and other leaders that they can

20:37.240 --> 20:42.360
look to outside of the church that seem to be more credible.

20:42.360 --> 20:47.580
I think of Joe Rogan and Terrence McKenna even as kind of classical religious figures

20:47.580 --> 20:51.920
in a way because one, they take psychedelics, right?

20:51.920 --> 20:57.240
So they have had that real personal experience with some kind of divinity.

20:57.240 --> 21:06.920
Also because they kind of frame things, they intellectually frame things and communicate,

21:06.920 --> 21:14.320
and that's really a big part of what the church did and has done for thousands of years is

21:14.320 --> 21:21.380
framing the current political events and goings on and happenings in any empire and trying

21:21.380 --> 21:29.720
to help direct the course of action of a community in some way and creating a narrative.

21:29.720 --> 21:31.840
It worked out good in some cases.

21:31.840 --> 21:39.440
For example, the Protestant churches in the early colonial American states, the Protestant

21:39.440 --> 21:44.160
churches preached out against the British empire and these authoritarian systems of

21:44.160 --> 21:45.200
control.

21:45.200 --> 21:50.280
So there are some cases where the church really kind of served its purpose in a meaningful

21:50.280 --> 21:54.840
capacity, but it seems you could make arguments, I think, both ways.

21:54.840 --> 21:58.960
There are some areas where the church is kind of really trying to step up and kind of get

21:58.960 --> 22:05.600
some level of justice for at least for conservative people in American society today.

22:05.600 --> 22:11.600
But I think that they're not really totally doing enough because I think it's very surface

22:11.600 --> 22:17.280
level appeals to religion and there is not a really deep appeal to what the core of religion

22:17.280 --> 22:18.280
is.

22:18.280 --> 22:21.720
In order to get there, you have to include some kind of conversation about these psychedelics

22:21.720 --> 22:28.280
because it's always been part of this despite the fact that it's been swept under the rug

22:28.280 --> 22:32.640
to a large extent and at least that's my view on it.

22:32.640 --> 22:35.120
Yeah, I agree and they're not going to go away.

22:35.120 --> 22:40.720
They've been around much longer than we have been.

22:40.720 --> 22:46.040
We've talked about Stoned Ape Theory a couple of times on this podcast.

22:46.040 --> 22:52.040
You make the connection between Stoned Ape Theory and creation of religions, which basically

22:52.040 --> 22:57.160
can be extended into creation of cultures and societies because all of these have been

22:57.160 --> 23:05.320
built in one way or another on religious foundations, especially in Western, modern day Western

23:05.320 --> 23:09.960
kind of society that we're talking about.

23:09.960 --> 23:15.440
The Stoned Ape Theory, for those who don't know, is a theory that human brain, correct

23:15.440 --> 23:20.900
me if I'm wrong, human brain evolve faster than the rest of our body and the main reason

23:20.900 --> 23:26.720
for that is that we start munching on psychedelics basically and have those kind of experiences.

23:26.720 --> 23:28.720
It's a theory by Terence McKenna.

23:28.720 --> 23:31.800
It's a sensible theory if you think about it.

23:31.800 --> 23:37.180
Now you can expand from that that maybe psychedelics have been planted here by some other species

23:37.180 --> 23:41.800
or extraterrestrial and anything is a possibility, right?

23:41.800 --> 23:48.160
But what is the connection from the point that we start munching on psychedelics until

23:48.160 --> 23:54.880
we're creating a concept of God, that there is a higher authority.

23:54.880 --> 23:59.760
Based on my knowledge, the oldest that I know of, the evidence of it was found in this cave

23:59.760 --> 24:05.080
in France that was made into a documentary, Cave of Forgotten Dreams, I think, by Werner

24:05.080 --> 24:06.080
Herzog.

24:06.080 --> 24:13.520
It's like 30,000, 35,000 years ago and they found the first symbology of people worshiping

24:13.520 --> 24:17.280
some kind of a higher authority.

24:17.280 --> 24:19.520
Right.

24:19.520 --> 24:21.200
It's an interesting question.

24:21.200 --> 24:27.080
Yeah, how does the idea of God come out of these psychedelic experiences?

24:27.080 --> 24:29.440
It's an interesting question.

24:29.440 --> 24:35.440
I don't necessarily know if I can answer it.

24:35.440 --> 24:42.200
What I might say is that the general experience of psychedelics, how you could describe it

24:42.200 --> 24:48.840
in some semi-scientific way I think would be to say it creates a kind of internal biological

24:48.840 --> 24:51.200
singularity for a person.

24:51.200 --> 24:56.600
Basically your senses get all mixed up in a way and you perceive everything all at the

24:56.600 --> 25:00.280
same time and you don't have your filters on basically that you don't say, okay, this

25:00.280 --> 25:04.240
is that, this is this.

25:04.240 --> 25:09.200
You're mentally kind of incapacitated in a way and you're not capable of making any kind

25:09.200 --> 25:15.000
of value judgments or doing anything like that.

25:15.000 --> 25:21.080
So what happens is you get into this, what I would call a direct confrontation with reality.

25:21.080 --> 25:24.720
You're really seeing reality for what it is when you're under the influence of psychedelics

25:24.720 --> 25:28.400
is one way of looking at it.

25:28.400 --> 25:30.620
Sometimes that reality can be terrifying.

25:30.620 --> 25:32.400
Sometimes it can be very enjoyable.

25:32.400 --> 25:36.720
It kind of depends on who you are as a person and how you're going into it, the mindset

25:36.720 --> 25:39.280
you're bringing to it.

25:39.280 --> 25:45.000
But the thing that I think most people experience is they get to this point where they see that

25:45.000 --> 25:50.840
everything is somehow connected in our world and you become open to this idea I think of

25:50.840 --> 25:56.600
a kind of vast depth to the world that you can't understand.

25:56.600 --> 25:59.140
For example, we don't know where we come from as human beings.

25:59.140 --> 26:00.520
We don't really know the answer to that.

26:00.520 --> 26:04.120
We have some scientific theories, we have some history that shows us, okay, there were

26:04.120 --> 26:06.720
people over here at this point in time.

26:06.720 --> 26:12.920
But I mean, as far as where life comes from, all of these deep questions, psychedelics

26:12.920 --> 26:18.500
kind of confront you with this reality that you don't really know, that we don't really

26:18.500 --> 26:24.680
know and that there has to be some kind of, I think, author behind this.

26:24.680 --> 26:28.480
And I think that it's a natural conclusion for people to come to when you see cause and

26:28.480 --> 26:33.360
effect in your ordinary life, well, something had to cause us to end up here.

26:33.360 --> 26:41.360
So you kind of come to this conclusion that there is something behind nature that is orchestrating

26:41.360 --> 26:47.160
everything that we do in some way.

26:47.160 --> 26:52.720
A lot of the language with, for example, the psychedelic community in the 1960s, I find

26:52.720 --> 26:59.960
very similar to language you find in the Abrahamic religions about submission to God, right?

26:59.960 --> 27:03.720
When you take trips, you got to let go, you got to let the thing take its course.

27:03.720 --> 27:06.480
You can't try and control it or you're going to have a bad time.

27:06.480 --> 27:11.480
It's the same way with, I mean, the Prophet Muhammad, you know, is all about submission

27:11.480 --> 27:12.480
to God.

27:12.480 --> 27:15.600
I mean, it sounds like he's giving advice about how to trip in some way.

27:15.600 --> 27:18.480
So there's one way of looking at it for sure.

27:18.480 --> 27:23.600
And Muhammad, especially in my opinion, has all of the cultural indicators of somebody

27:23.600 --> 27:25.200
who's taking psychedelics.

27:25.200 --> 27:30.720
But just to briefly close this up, one thing I would say is that how stoned ape theory

27:30.720 --> 27:37.020
makes its way into the Bible, I think is actually pretty linear and pretty straightforward.

27:37.020 --> 27:45.000
So the way that people stumbled upon these drugs in the earliest form was basically when

27:45.000 --> 27:47.560
they were hunter gatherers, they were hunting livestock.

27:47.560 --> 27:50.440
They'd track the animal and they'd look at the poop and they'd see, oh, there's some

27:50.440 --> 27:51.440
mushrooms growing here.

27:51.440 --> 27:56.040
And then they'd eat these things and they'd kind of get a physical invigoration out of

27:56.040 --> 27:57.040
it.

27:57.040 --> 27:59.500
You know, the fight or flight response gets kind of invoked.

27:59.500 --> 28:03.520
And then they continue their hunt and, you know, so it became part of this hunting ritual,

28:03.520 --> 28:08.840
you know, and this part of feeding your family and doing all of this.

28:08.840 --> 28:14.520
This I think was very clearly carried over into the nomadic lifestyle of early Israelites.

28:14.520 --> 28:19.040
They had cattle, they were domesticated by the time we get to the Bible, but they had

28:19.040 --> 28:20.800
cattle, they were pooping everywhere around them.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.440
They probably came into contact with these mushrooms and there's areas in the Bible where

28:23.440 --> 28:26.560
you can say it's pretty clear that they did.

28:26.560 --> 28:29.920
Exodus 16 is really the best example we have.

28:29.920 --> 28:37.480
So where religion comes from, it's these people who are taking these drugs, I think, and basically

28:37.480 --> 28:41.440
they have these imaginal experiences where they're visualizing everything in the world

28:41.440 --> 28:46.280
and their sensors are kind of removed and they can really see how things work.

28:46.280 --> 28:48.400
And so that leads to good planning.

28:48.400 --> 28:52.040
That leads to good thinking about things and these people who can predict what's going

28:52.040 --> 28:56.520
to happen end up earning the respect of their communities and they end up becoming leaders,

28:56.520 --> 29:01.520
they become priests, they become saints, they have the ear of the God or whatever.

29:01.520 --> 29:06.080
And so you get this whole administrative structure that leads to basically the first forms of

29:06.080 --> 29:09.080
government, I think, out of that kind of scenario.

29:09.080 --> 29:13.560
And it seems pretty clear when you look at the Bible that that's basically what it was.

29:13.560 --> 29:18.800
It was the first leadership, the first clergy were the people who were taking these drugs,

29:18.800 --> 29:21.040
having these direct experiences.

29:21.040 --> 29:28.000
And that's basically what created religion in the form of the state as it was like in

29:28.000 --> 29:31.680
Egypt and in these early primitive religions.

29:31.680 --> 29:34.880
Religion and the state were one and the same.

29:34.880 --> 29:40.160
So that deeper theological element, I try not to explain it too much because personally,

29:40.160 --> 29:43.920
I mean, I'm kind of a believer, I believe that there is a deeper theological element

29:43.920 --> 29:47.800
to taking hallucinogens and I don't think it's necessarily explainable.

29:47.800 --> 29:51.980
I don't think we, I think it's kind of, the one thing that we can explain though is historical

29:51.980 --> 29:57.140
events where people took this stuff or potential historical events that are recorded in places

29:57.140 --> 30:00.760
like the Bible, also in places like Plutarch's Lives.

30:00.760 --> 30:05.920
I think the Iliad has some records of people taking hallucinogens too.

30:05.920 --> 30:08.880
And yeah, we can get into some of that as we go along here.

30:08.880 --> 30:17.840
Yeah, I think it's not explainable by design, by the essence of the experience, which it

30:17.840 --> 30:24.560
really goes to a deeper layer of the question that I asked because a lot of, not a lot of,

30:24.560 --> 30:29.800
all of our understanding based on religions of this divine experience is based on words

30:29.800 --> 30:37.360
and based on language, yet, as you correctly said, this experience is unexplainable.

30:37.360 --> 30:41.920
This is something that I talk to my girlfriend a lot about it, that I don't even see the

30:41.920 --> 30:47.680
point of trying to describe, for example, a DMT experience because language don't belong

30:47.680 --> 30:48.680
there.

30:48.680 --> 30:49.680
Exactly.

30:49.680 --> 30:50.680
Right?

30:50.680 --> 30:51.680
Yes.

30:51.680 --> 30:56.600
So the question is, if people were having these divine experiences before the invention

30:56.600 --> 31:04.200
of language, so this concept of a divine being, a higher power, higher being, must have been

31:04.200 --> 31:10.000
developed before language was developed because we're using words and language in order to

31:10.000 --> 31:16.320
dumb down this experience, to try to describe it to people who are reading it rather than

31:16.320 --> 31:17.320
doing it.

31:17.320 --> 31:18.320
Right?

31:18.320 --> 31:24.080
If this is the case, then we are committing the biggest crime against humanity by not

31:24.080 --> 31:30.680
allowing people to experience this divinity that belongs to not only all of us, to everything.

31:30.680 --> 31:31.680
It is everything.

31:31.680 --> 31:32.680
Right.

31:32.680 --> 31:33.800
Directly.

31:33.800 --> 31:38.040
But you see exactly why this is happening because if you can't have direct experiences,

31:38.040 --> 31:44.320
then you don't need a priest and all these kind of people, most of whom are crooks and

31:44.320 --> 31:51.400
businessmen and basically those merchants around the table that Jesus decided to mess

31:51.400 --> 31:53.120
their shit up, basically.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.120
Yeah.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.120
Right.

31:55.120 --> 31:56.120
Right.

31:56.120 --> 31:57.120
Right.

31:57.120 --> 31:59.080
Well, the thing about language is actually kind of interesting too.

31:59.080 --> 32:05.400
So something that personally I've experienced with psychedelic drugs, but also that seems

32:05.400 --> 32:11.880
to be kind of an emergent phenomena is that you have this activation of this linguistic

32:11.880 --> 32:14.840
capacity with psychedelics.

32:14.840 --> 32:21.820
And there's some notions that psilocybin may help grow brain cells.

32:21.820 --> 32:28.720
So the way that it grows the brain evolutionarily can kind of make sense if you have pregnant

32:28.720 --> 32:35.600
women taking hallucinogens, these mushrooms basically, in archaic society, they don't

32:35.600 --> 32:36.600
know any better.

32:36.600 --> 32:37.600
It's just this fun time.

32:37.600 --> 32:43.040
They take this drug and it's probably in some capacity mutating the brain of the baby inside

32:43.040 --> 32:44.040
their womb.

32:44.040 --> 32:51.480
I would imagine it's like a kind of reverse fetal alcohol syndrome or something.

32:51.480 --> 32:55.400
But as far as language is concerned, what you have is you have these hominids being

32:55.400 --> 33:02.360
born with perhaps larger cranial capacity, larger brain size, and they take these drugs.

33:02.360 --> 33:04.840
They probably continue this tradition.

33:04.840 --> 33:09.760
And what happens is you're exposed to this very deep and inconceivable reality.

33:09.760 --> 33:15.160
The natural impulse, I think, for us as human beings, as living things, is to categorize

33:15.160 --> 33:17.600
and understand what it is we experience.

33:17.600 --> 33:22.760
And the way that we do that is by developing terms and language and things that we share

33:22.760 --> 33:29.160
in common and we relate with each other about what we experienced.

33:29.160 --> 33:34.760
So language, I think, probably emerges out of that chaotic experience as an attempt to

33:34.760 --> 33:38.840
try and explain some part of it.

33:38.840 --> 33:44.920
So not necessarily, and I think that's a virtuous maybe to an extent to try and explain a piece

33:44.920 --> 33:48.440
of it, but you have to recognize you're not going to get the whole thing.

33:48.440 --> 33:50.680
You know, it's not going to happen.

33:50.680 --> 33:54.320
I'm sure people will be wrestling with this, you know, what the psychedelic experience

33:54.320 --> 33:55.320
is.

33:55.320 --> 34:00.160
I mean, if they want, if they choose to, they'll probably be wrestling with it forever.

34:00.160 --> 34:05.040
But I basically, as far as my book is concerned, I just focus on history because you can look

34:05.040 --> 34:08.800
at history and you can point at texts and you can say, this might have happened here

34:08.800 --> 34:10.920
or this might have been going on here.

34:10.920 --> 34:15.320
And when you contextualize things like, for example, the Old Testament of the Bible, and

34:15.320 --> 34:19.680
you pull out, you know, sources from ancient Egypt and, you know, the Amarna letters and

34:19.680 --> 34:24.040
you kind of combine everything and you put it in the right historical context, you can

34:24.040 --> 34:28.760
get a really deep picture of what was going on in the Old Testament.

34:28.760 --> 34:31.760
I mean, it's kind of been shocking for me personally.

34:31.760 --> 34:33.360
I was surprised as I was writing my book.

34:33.360 --> 34:34.920
I'm like, why hasn't anybody done this yet?

34:34.920 --> 34:35.920
I was totally shocked.

34:35.920 --> 34:41.520
Please describe this as in depth as you possibly can, the relationship between Old Testament

34:41.520 --> 34:42.520
and psychedelics.

34:42.520 --> 34:43.520
Yeah.

34:43.520 --> 34:45.920
Oh, well, there's a lot of building blocks.

34:45.920 --> 34:49.840
So the way that I write my book is very linear, very chronological.

34:49.840 --> 34:53.920
It starts from the beginning of Genesis and it just goes through the stories and I touch

34:53.920 --> 34:55.760
on the big important pieces.

34:55.760 --> 35:00.520
Basically, the way that I frame it out in the beginning parts is that the first couple

35:00.520 --> 35:03.560
books of Genesis are kind of mythologies.

35:03.560 --> 35:07.880
They're stories about, you know, Adam and Eve in the garden and you kind of have this

35:07.880 --> 35:09.840
mushroom story going on there.

35:09.840 --> 35:15.200
And then you also have Cain and Abel, which is basically a kind of polemic that's basically

35:15.200 --> 35:21.020
agriculturalists versus nomadic hunter-gatherers, basically.

35:21.020 --> 35:28.160
And basically, Yahweh, the Abrahamic God, doesn't like agriculturalists.

35:28.160 --> 35:35.520
He refuses their offering, he banishes Cain and he sends them out of the city and Cain

35:35.520 --> 35:39.560
then becomes jealous and he kills his brother Abel, who's a nomadic pastoralist who God

35:39.560 --> 35:41.520
loves or whatever.

35:41.520 --> 35:47.840
It seems to me it's a very simple kind of primitive form of propaganda that says, look,

35:47.840 --> 35:52.640
the hunter-gatherer is the lifestyle that you want to have because they're not beholden

35:52.640 --> 35:58.160
to these emperors and these pharaohs in Egypt or whatever.

35:58.160 --> 36:02.080
They don't have to break their back working the land for somebody else, they get to just

36:02.080 --> 36:06.520
have their cattle, they live out on the outskirts of civilization, they get to relax, take it

36:06.520 --> 36:07.520
easy.

36:07.520 --> 36:11.120
And this is the kind of way of life that is pleasing to the Abrahamic God.

36:11.120 --> 36:15.400
And also, part of that is probably the fact that you have mushrooms growing out of their

36:15.400 --> 36:19.840
poop and that's their sacrament and that's part of this whole ancient religion that goes

36:19.840 --> 36:25.280
back to Terence McKenna and the, you know, the stoned ape theory is this partnership

36:25.280 --> 36:30.280
society with cattle, with women and with mushrooms, basically.

36:30.280 --> 36:36.560
And you see that partnership society carry on through the whole Old Testament, you see

36:36.560 --> 36:37.560
it everywhere.

36:37.560 --> 36:40.520
If you're paying attention to it and you're looking at it through the lens of Terence

36:40.520 --> 36:44.980
McKenna, you see that there's a veneration of fertility, you know, Abraham's given the

36:44.980 --> 36:48.640
promise by God, you're going to have lots of kids, you're going to have a lot of sex,

36:48.640 --> 36:56.600
you know, and then you have the promise of, or you have the relationship with cattle throughout

36:56.600 --> 36:57.600
the Old Testament.

36:57.600 --> 37:01.720
The Israelites are nomads after they leave Egypt, they live with cattle and they live

37:01.720 --> 37:05.360
in the wilderness, quote unquote.

37:05.360 --> 37:10.400
And then you have, so it's the women, fertility, and then you have the mushrooms, and there's

37:10.400 --> 37:15.080
a couple of different places where the mushrooms really assert themselves as a very plausible

37:15.080 --> 37:17.200
explanation for things.

37:17.200 --> 37:23.320
And the most obvious one is the manna, which is described in Exodus, we talked a little

37:23.320 --> 37:30.320
bit about this, but the manna appears basically as soon as the Israelites leave the agricultural

37:30.320 --> 37:35.760
civilization of Egypt and they revert to a nomadic lifestyle, that's when the manna appears,

37:35.760 --> 37:40.200
which is very interesting because it's consistent with everything Terence McKenna talked about,

37:40.200 --> 37:45.920
about how cattle-oriented societies would develop partnership relationships with these

37:45.920 --> 37:46.920
drugs.

37:46.920 --> 37:53.720
So, the Bible is very consistent with things that Terence McKenna said, it's really remarkable.

37:53.720 --> 37:59.320
And it just all makes sense once you realize this is a nomadic society of people who are

37:59.320 --> 38:02.040
living on the outskirts of civilization.

38:02.040 --> 38:08.200
And Moses is actually trained by this priest named Jethro, Shuaib he's called in the Arabic

38:08.200 --> 38:19.000
tradition, and his training is basically seems, Jethro is a shepherd, so he has flocks of

38:19.000 --> 38:20.960
sheep and Moses takes care of these sheep.

38:20.960 --> 38:25.840
And again, you know, the sheep poop and the mushrooms grow out because they're in a fertile

38:25.840 --> 38:31.340
area that's warm, those are the conditions for growing psilocybin mushrooms.

38:31.340 --> 38:37.280
When Moses has his vision of the burning bush, I don't consider that to be a DMT trip, what

38:37.280 --> 38:41.680
I think was happening is while he's looking after the sheep, he ate some mushrooms and

38:41.680 --> 38:44.640
then he walked over to this bush and he had this hallucination.

38:44.640 --> 38:47.520
Because the way the Bible describes it is that the bush was burning, but it was not

38:47.520 --> 38:50.500
consumed by the flame, so it's not literal.

38:50.500 --> 38:54.400
He's having hallucination quite literally, he's already tripping by the point he approaches

38:54.400 --> 38:55.400
this bush.

38:55.400 --> 39:01.640
And then after that, he has this visionary experience where he basically sees the future

39:01.640 --> 39:03.000
is the way that the Bible describes it.

39:03.000 --> 39:07.240
Yeah, they might have retroactively went in there and written the future in to that experience

39:07.240 --> 39:12.640
but basically this seems to me like the moment where he kind of develops his strategy about

39:12.640 --> 39:17.040
how he's going to get the Israelites out of Egypt is under the influence of these drugs.

39:17.040 --> 39:23.200
And it's this very interesting liberatory message and the psychedelics kind of inspire

39:23.200 --> 39:29.920
Moses to basically set out by himself with nothing into Egypt to basically start these

39:29.920 --> 39:34.420
negotiations with the Pharaoh and say, look, you know, the Israelites were done working

39:34.420 --> 39:35.420
for you.

39:35.420 --> 39:41.320
We're in our own nation, we're our own people and we're done.

39:41.320 --> 39:45.680
But he doesn't phrase it that way, he actually phrases it and says, I want to go with my

39:45.680 --> 39:50.440
people outside of Egypt to have a religious ceremony for three days.

39:50.440 --> 39:57.120
So he's basically just trying to get them out of Egypt across the Red Sea and then they

39:57.120 --> 40:02.080
can just establish themselves as nomadic society because he had been experiencing that and

40:02.080 --> 40:07.120
living that lifestyle since he was kicked out of Egypt after he assassinated some Egyptian

40:07.120 --> 40:09.160
slave driver, basically.

40:09.160 --> 40:15.440
So it's this interesting political story that is like fueled by mushrooms as far as I can

40:15.440 --> 40:16.920
tell.

40:16.920 --> 40:23.720
Moses has these insights and these incredible strategic insights about how to deliver the

40:23.720 --> 40:30.200
Israelites out of bondage and out of servitude to the Egyptian empire and his strategy is

40:30.200 --> 40:34.300
just to have the Israelites revert to a nomadic lifestyle.

40:34.300 --> 40:38.160
They were supposed to take cattle and they were supposed to take loans from the Egyptians

40:38.160 --> 40:41.520
before they left and they did this apparently.

40:41.520 --> 40:47.280
And so there's this whole thing where they they landed from the Egyptians and got their

40:47.280 --> 40:51.840
jewelry basically because they wanted to make sacrifices to their God or whatever.

40:51.840 --> 40:55.040
They made up some excuse is basically what happened.

40:55.040 --> 40:59.700
And then they just left and then they had that in their possession.

40:59.700 --> 41:05.620
So the way the Bible says it is that they plundered the Egyptians without bloodshed.

41:05.620 --> 41:10.920
So they basically looted Egypt and left and started their own society and civilization

41:10.920 --> 41:11.920
living in tents.

41:11.920 --> 41:15.840
And that was a kind of traditional way of living for lots of people at that time.

41:15.840 --> 41:18.040
So it wasn't necessarily crazy or anything.

41:18.040 --> 41:25.280
I mean, it was a normal way for some groups of people to live and then he organized everybody

41:25.280 --> 41:28.560
according to their 12 tribes.

41:28.560 --> 41:30.800
I allude to the Atlantis myth, too.

41:30.800 --> 41:33.840
I think Moses might have been familiar with that.

41:33.840 --> 41:39.160
The Atlanteans had 10 kings and the 10 kings kind of oversaw different parts of society.

41:39.160 --> 41:42.720
Moses seems to kind of apply that same principle to the Israelites.

41:42.720 --> 41:47.800
There's 12 tribes and they're overseeing their own tribes and they have these kind of the

41:47.800 --> 41:49.800
system of delegated judges.

41:49.800 --> 41:56.220
So it's a very kind of distributed government that gets established and it's really interesting.

41:56.220 --> 42:01.400
So you see the generation of the culture from scratch in that in that old biblical story.

42:01.400 --> 42:03.600
A lot of people say it's not real.

42:03.600 --> 42:06.480
I won't prove that it's not real if it's not real.

42:06.480 --> 42:11.120
I mean, there's a reason that this text has been preserved for as long as it has survived

42:11.120 --> 42:16.200
for as long as it doesn't even matter if it's real because people are acting based on the

42:16.200 --> 42:19.280
belief and faith in it.

42:19.280 --> 42:24.480
Well yeah, I do personally, I think you get to a point in Genesis where you start talking

42:24.480 --> 42:28.880
about Abraham and you have these historical events taking place.

42:28.880 --> 42:34.360
I don't think that an ancient culture or society would make up stories about their patriarchs

42:34.360 --> 42:36.040
and live by it for thousands of years.

42:36.040 --> 42:37.920
I don't think that makes sense.

42:37.920 --> 42:41.580
I mean, that's just not something that they would do.

42:41.580 --> 42:44.800
If they were going to make up a story, it would be about gods and angels and it would

42:44.800 --> 42:46.920
be some kind of psychedelic visionary thing.

42:46.920 --> 42:52.160
When you're talking about historical events, I don't see a reason to believe that these

42:52.160 --> 42:54.400
people would have made this up.

42:54.400 --> 43:00.000
I think it's a highly incredulous way of looking at this.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.960
It doesn't give these people any credit.

43:01.960 --> 43:07.000
I mean, they were living in primitive conditions most certainly, but they were able to survive.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.880
They had to be smart in order to survive in those conditions.

43:10.880 --> 43:13.800
They had to make sense of the world around them.

43:13.800 --> 43:19.720
So I am very much a kind of apologeticist about the Bible.

43:19.720 --> 43:24.040
But that being said, I don't necessarily take the dogmatic approach that people today take.

43:24.040 --> 43:28.720
I take a historical approach, like how did this historically happen if it happened at

43:28.720 --> 43:29.720
all?

43:29.720 --> 43:35.160
And that's kind of how I approach the stories because it seems to me that there's lots of

43:35.160 --> 43:38.840
things in there that are very plausible.

43:38.840 --> 43:41.280
And we have more evidence now than we used to.

43:41.280 --> 43:48.660
King Solomon, for example, or sorry, King David is referenced in this stella called

43:48.660 --> 43:50.280
the Tel Dan Stella.

43:50.280 --> 43:55.400
It's basically a Hittite stone tablet that references a King David and it dates to about

43:55.400 --> 43:57.640
the time that King David should be around.

43:57.640 --> 44:00.120
This wasn't, I think it was a pretty recent discovery.

44:00.120 --> 44:03.960
So there's some of these recent discoveries that are coming out that seem to indicate

44:03.960 --> 44:06.320
that yes, the Israelites were real.

44:06.320 --> 44:09.340
They weren't like fan fiction of these ancient people.

44:09.340 --> 44:14.320
They were a real historical group and they had an empire and they had a civilization.

44:14.320 --> 44:19.220
And in some ways, I prove this actually in my book and I have some images that I've shared

44:19.220 --> 44:21.600
with you that we can go over as well.

44:21.600 --> 44:26.440
But yeah, if there's any questions or any statements you have on that, you can go ahead.

44:26.440 --> 44:29.160
Well, there are a couple of things.

44:29.160 --> 44:35.600
First of all, the entire psychedelic experience and psychedelics as substance, to me, it makes

44:35.600 --> 44:41.840
sense that they've been preserved as some kind of an exclusivity throughout history

44:41.840 --> 44:45.120
because it's being considered knowledge, the source of knowledge.

44:45.120 --> 44:46.120
Right.

44:46.120 --> 44:47.120
Yeah.

44:47.120 --> 44:56.360
So it's not necessarily what Bible or any other book, whether fact or fiction is talking

44:56.360 --> 44:57.360
about.

44:57.360 --> 45:03.640
It's also how it's being defined and how the people who define those concepts and stories

45:03.640 --> 45:10.080
and lessons and all those things and teachings, how they're being pushed by a, again, a group

45:10.080 --> 45:15.160
of people who have been setting and driving a narrative that you were saying that it's

45:15.160 --> 45:21.120
been discredited very viciously throughout our lifetime, definitely.

45:21.120 --> 45:26.560
But this is a narrative that has been being built since really the enlightenment to minimize

45:26.560 --> 45:32.600
the role of saying, quote unquote, God, because we don't really know what it is because a

45:32.600 --> 45:36.440
lot of people have capitalized on the definition of it.

45:36.440 --> 45:38.360
So they can just take power, right?

45:38.360 --> 45:39.360
Right.

45:39.360 --> 45:44.120
So in absence of in God we trust, it will be in state we trust or in kings we trust

45:44.120 --> 45:50.120
or in, you know, there is no shortage of people who want to rule everybody else.

45:50.120 --> 45:51.120
Right.

45:51.120 --> 45:52.120
Yeah.

45:52.120 --> 45:58.680
So what I'm saying is that it doesn't really matter at this point, especially whether or

45:58.680 --> 46:03.120
not something can be even proven by evidence and fact, because there are tens of millions

46:03.120 --> 46:04.960
of people who are like, oh, I just don't believe it.

46:04.960 --> 46:06.920
It doesn't make sense to me.

46:06.920 --> 46:14.160
You know, and what I'm saying is that this not being able to have the direct experience

46:14.160 --> 46:20.780
and then make sense out of all these pieces that each part can resonate with you differently.

46:20.780 --> 46:24.240
You know, you go and read the Bible, part of it resonates with you.

46:24.240 --> 46:27.520
You read Bhagavad Gita, part of it resonates with you.

46:27.520 --> 46:32.720
And out of all of that, you create that raft that Buddha is saying you build a raft, you

46:32.720 --> 46:33.720
cross the river.

46:33.720 --> 46:36.480
Once you cross the river, you don't need a raft anymore.

46:36.480 --> 46:37.480
Right.

46:37.480 --> 46:38.480
Sure.

46:38.480 --> 46:39.480
Yeah.

46:39.480 --> 46:40.480
Right.

46:40.480 --> 46:41.480
Right.

46:41.480 --> 46:42.480
Right.

46:42.480 --> 46:43.480
Yeah.

46:43.480 --> 46:44.480
Yeah.

46:44.480 --> 46:45.480
I mean, I think there's insight and wisdom in all of these traditions.

46:45.480 --> 46:46.480
No doubt.

46:46.480 --> 46:54.400
I mean, I think it's an interesting argument to make that, you know, that this is a kind

46:54.400 --> 47:01.500
of perennial source for us today, as you were just saying, you know, to build that life

47:01.500 --> 47:06.720
raft, you know, to kind of figure out our lives and to figure out.

47:06.720 --> 47:11.880
And really, the big thing that has kind of been a part of my thinking for a long time

47:11.880 --> 47:19.360
and something I put in the book pretty prominently is how do we build a better government that

47:19.360 --> 47:21.800
doesn't do the things that we have going on today?

47:21.800 --> 47:25.160
You know, how did the ancient people build their governments?

47:25.160 --> 47:27.640
Because you know, they had to figure it out somehow.

47:27.640 --> 47:29.600
What was the organizational principle?

47:29.600 --> 47:35.360
What were they doing when they were establishing, you know, the Athenian Senate or, you know,

47:35.360 --> 47:36.360
what was it?

47:36.360 --> 47:39.920
What was the impetus that made them do this and create these institutions?

47:39.920 --> 47:42.640
I think the psychedelic drugs are a big part of that.

47:42.640 --> 47:49.280
I think so much so even that by the time you get to the Romans, that you have basically

47:49.280 --> 47:52.040
what's called the stipend Palaeus symbolism.

47:52.040 --> 47:54.520
It's the pole and the hat on top of it.

47:54.520 --> 47:57.240
You've probably seen this iconography all over the United States.

47:57.240 --> 48:02.140
It was a big piece of iconography.

48:02.140 --> 48:07.160
This iconography in ancient Rome, I think, was a symbol of a mushroom.

48:07.160 --> 48:12.120
And I think it was actually for the colonial Americans as well.

48:12.120 --> 48:14.740
But what it meant was group government.

48:14.740 --> 48:19.200
It meant collective thinking and action.

48:19.200 --> 48:21.820
It was a senatorial congressional government.

48:21.820 --> 48:23.080
That's what it was a symbol of.

48:23.080 --> 48:29.320
And so when the Romans assassinated Julius Caesar, they kind of paraded the stipend Palaeus

48:29.320 --> 48:32.760
around these mushroom symbols around saying, look, the group government is back.

48:32.760 --> 48:35.600
We don't longer have this dictator Caesar anymore.

48:35.600 --> 48:40.560
They appropriated this mushroom symbolism and used it to say, look, you know, the Senate's

48:40.560 --> 48:41.560
back.

48:41.560 --> 48:42.560
We're back in control.

48:42.560 --> 48:47.160
We have a group government that's based on this ancient religious symbolism.

48:47.160 --> 48:51.680
But they ended up, of course, getting overthrown very shortly after that.

48:51.680 --> 48:58.940
So I don't necessarily think that the senators were authentic kind of religious practitioners

48:58.940 --> 49:01.120
of this tradition at that time.

49:01.120 --> 49:04.120
But the symbolism survived for a long time.

49:04.120 --> 49:09.960
It was the symbol of a freed slave as well, which is very interesting because the Romans

49:09.960 --> 49:15.400
had this idea about slaves that slaves can't be free because they don't have personal accountability.

49:15.400 --> 49:16.400
They need a master.

49:16.400 --> 49:20.680
They need someone to tell them what to do because they don't have a self-accounting

49:20.680 --> 49:21.680
mechanism.

49:21.680 --> 49:25.320
And this was their mentality back in those times.

49:25.320 --> 49:29.440
And the thing that would set you free is to develop that self-accounting mechanisms, that

49:29.440 --> 49:34.520
morality, that internal inspection, and something that can do that is psychedelic drugs.

49:34.520 --> 49:39.000
I mean, so it's very interesting that this mushroom symbolism, the seemingly mushroom

49:39.000 --> 49:45.120
symbolism became the symbol of the freed slave, someone who had gained self-mastery and self-consciousness

49:45.120 --> 49:47.960
and self-awareness.

49:47.960 --> 49:51.660
It's a very interesting thing, and it's also the symbol of freedom in the old biblical

49:51.660 --> 49:53.040
stories as well.

49:53.040 --> 49:57.380
So you see this happen over and over again, where when these psychedelic drugs get introduced

49:57.380 --> 50:02.240
to a culture or a society, you have these situations where you have these kind of revolutionary

50:02.240 --> 50:07.840
sentiments start to erupt and emerge, and that form new governments, I think.

50:07.840 --> 50:11.840
And this is kind of my general historical theory that's kind of come out of my book,

50:11.840 --> 50:16.320
is that this is how you build a better government, is you find people who take psychedelics and

50:16.320 --> 50:19.720
you have them get in a room, you have them think about how to organize the society and

50:19.720 --> 50:24.880
establish some basic rules, not necessarily to lord over or rule over other people, but

50:24.880 --> 50:30.240
just for the sake of convenience of getting things done, because we can kind of see what's

50:30.240 --> 50:35.800
happening now in our society, in America today, where everyone is just not accountable.

50:35.800 --> 50:40.400
Everyone's just kicking the can down the road, and nobody's actually taking the crisis that

50:40.400 --> 50:41.800
we're in seriously.

50:41.800 --> 50:49.280
So I think a part of that lack of accountability, and I think of that as a religious problem,

50:49.280 --> 50:54.520
that lack of ethics and that lack of loyalty to the people that you're supposed to serve.

50:54.520 --> 50:59.680
I think this is a religious problem fundamentally, and I think the psychedelics are a big part

50:59.680 --> 51:00.680
of that answer.

51:00.680 --> 51:05.960
And the Bible is just a way for us to contextualize that experience, I think, and that's the way

51:05.960 --> 51:09.480
that I look at the Bible and I look at the history of the Bible.

51:09.480 --> 51:14.080
These guys did it already, so we can learn from them and bootstrap ourselves to that,

51:14.080 --> 51:18.400
to their way of doing things to a certain extent, but we can create our own ways of

51:18.400 --> 51:19.400
doing things.

51:19.400 --> 51:22.920
We have a new environment, we have technology, we've got these live streams, we've got so

51:22.920 --> 51:23.920
much.

51:23.920 --> 51:34.520
But what I kind of just under the principles of the organization, obligated authority,

51:34.520 --> 51:40.480
it's not all under one person's control or command, you have this kind of group government

51:40.480 --> 51:41.480
in some way.

51:41.480 --> 51:42.480
Decentralized.

51:42.480 --> 51:44.480
Yeah, decentralized government, exactly.

51:44.480 --> 51:45.480
Yes, yes.

51:45.480 --> 51:47.800
So, sorry, I'm a little rambly, sorry.

51:47.800 --> 51:48.800
No, no, no, no, no.

51:48.800 --> 51:54.720
I mean, obviously, you're following a train of thought, I don't want to interrupt that.

51:54.720 --> 52:02.360
I think a big part of what you mentioned is exactly in the difference of time, that the

52:02.360 --> 52:07.600
time that we're living in, considering the technology, and we talked about this with

52:07.600 --> 52:13.340
Jason Giorgiani too, that I don't see the evolution of humanity any separate or any

52:13.340 --> 52:16.160
different than evolution of technology.

52:16.160 --> 52:22.200
I think we have, and psychedelics actually, for me, fits perfectly, because technology

52:22.200 --> 52:24.080
is a tool.

52:24.080 --> 52:30.080
Psychedelic is a source of intention behind the tool, how to use it, and I think the biggest

52:30.080 --> 52:34.920
dilemma for humanity, exactly going back to this duality of religion, good and bad, right

52:34.920 --> 52:42.120
and wrong, is that at the core of it, it's not this or that, good and bad, right or wrong,

52:42.120 --> 52:48.500
it just is, and how you shape it and use it and whether or not you reach your objective

52:48.500 --> 52:49.640
or not.

52:49.640 --> 52:51.640
That's how it's been, right?

52:51.640 --> 52:56.720
And the time that we're living in right now, when I talk to people, for example, I don't

52:56.720 --> 53:02.800
think democracy is an efficient system of governance anymore, and they're like, well,

53:02.800 --> 53:06.040
so what's better than that, fascism, communism?

53:06.040 --> 53:11.640
The thing is, we might not even know the system that we need for this time that we haven't

53:11.640 --> 53:13.440
ever experienced it.

53:13.440 --> 53:18.640
We can't just go through the same bucket of recycled stuff and pull one out, like, okay,

53:18.640 --> 53:23.560
let's try this, let's try this, let's try this, it's not working, and that's why it's

53:23.560 --> 53:24.560
falling apart.

53:24.560 --> 53:27.280
It's based on lies and deception and corruption.

53:27.280 --> 53:32.880
Yeah, it might be a creative effort and endeavor for us to figure out what a new system looks

53:32.880 --> 53:37.640
like that works in our time and for our needs.

53:37.640 --> 53:43.280
Yeah, religions are basically their value systems and their ways of prioritizing your

53:43.280 --> 53:49.240
values, and so I think in some ways we do have to, in some capacity, reconstruct some

53:49.240 --> 53:53.240
kind of a modern religion of some form.

53:53.240 --> 53:56.200
I think actually it's already happening in a way.

53:56.200 --> 54:00.640
I think places like the Joe Rogan experience are a place where that religion is kind of

54:00.640 --> 54:09.280
being birthed, and you have this kind of orientation around psychedelics, around masculinity, around

54:09.280 --> 54:17.480
a few other science to a certain extent, and your diets, and your health, and your wellbeing.

54:17.480 --> 54:22.200
All the lecturers and all the people that go through his show are a lot of bright people,

54:22.200 --> 54:27.200
and that's kind of our priesthood in some ways, and a lot of our podcasters are a part

54:27.200 --> 54:29.760
of our priesthood in some ways.

54:29.760 --> 54:35.120
They're giving us condensed information that we can use and apply to our lives that hopefully

54:35.120 --> 54:42.120
improve our lives in some capacity, and in some cases the one area that people aren't

54:42.120 --> 54:47.280
going into because nobody wants to get in trouble is how do we fix the government, and

54:47.280 --> 54:52.760
also because it's also an extremely complicated question and an extremely complicated problem.

54:52.760 --> 54:58.560
I don't think anybody has all of the answers to how to do that, but I think it's an important

54:58.560 --> 55:01.320
question to ask and to talk about for sure.

55:01.320 --> 55:10.600
There's also a problem of how to define the we, because we in Florida is kind of different

55:10.600 --> 55:15.000
than we in California, for example, in the context of the United States.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
Right.

55:16.000 --> 55:22.080
Some people want more control and authoritarianism and tyranny because they think that, for example,

55:22.080 --> 55:27.280
with respect to this virus, there is a way that you can defeat the virus, and some people

55:27.280 --> 55:32.360
really do believe it, and people who don't believe it and lead and have access to resources,

55:32.360 --> 55:35.960
they just capitalize on that and are like, okay, we're just kicking, as you said, kicking

55:35.960 --> 55:41.220
the can down the road and keep changing the goalpost because this is an unreachable kind

55:41.220 --> 55:45.200
of goal, and at the same time you see some people that are like, just leave me alone,

55:45.200 --> 55:46.200
man.

55:46.200 --> 55:49.080
I've got guns and I've got land, and if you come to my land, I'm going to shoot you with

55:49.080 --> 55:50.080
my gun.

55:50.080 --> 55:51.080
Right.

55:51.080 --> 55:52.080
I don't know.

55:52.080 --> 55:57.040
When I look at American history and I look at, and I've been doing that more as I'm kind

55:57.040 --> 56:01.880
of writing my second book, that's a follow-up to my Old Testament kind of history book.

56:01.880 --> 56:07.600
I've been looking at American history and I'm really impressed by the founders and how

56:07.600 --> 56:08.720
insightful they were.

56:08.720 --> 56:12.480
They were remarkably insightful.

56:12.480 --> 56:17.880
They had a very limited, they had a sense of keeping the federal government fairly limited.

56:17.880 --> 56:26.920
The jobs that it had basically were defense, so the military, and the currency.

56:26.920 --> 56:30.640
There was an attempt at creating some kind of a universal currency that was managed by

56:30.640 --> 56:36.000
the Congress, and other than that, the states generally had their kind of right to make

56:36.000 --> 56:39.480
their own decisions.

56:39.480 --> 56:43.680
I think that we're probably going to see some kind of reversion to more local government

56:43.680 --> 56:44.680
in the United States.

56:44.680 --> 56:45.680
Federalism, basically.

56:45.680 --> 56:46.680
Revival of federalism.

56:46.680 --> 56:51.480
Well, I don't know about a revival of federalism.

56:51.480 --> 56:55.300
I think the opposite actually, where you're going to have, even county governments might

56:55.300 --> 56:59.760
be very different from their neighboring counties in some cases.

56:59.760 --> 57:04.280
If you live in a city or if you live in a rural area, I think you're going to have a

57:04.280 --> 57:08.640
lot more regional policy making, and we're kind of seeing that actually with policy around

57:08.640 --> 57:11.520
COVID and all of that.

57:11.520 --> 57:16.560
I think you're going to see more regionalism happen, but it would be nice to have some

57:16.560 --> 57:21.680
kind of federal framework where we can generally agree on some kind of fundamental principles

57:21.680 --> 57:26.560
of what the federal government's supposed to do and what their job is.

57:26.560 --> 57:29.680
Back in the day, it was the military, the defense of the country.

57:29.680 --> 57:33.820
Everybody agreed that you wanted to keep the powers of Europe outside of our country because

57:33.820 --> 57:37.260
they were all crazy monarchists.

57:37.260 --> 57:39.040
Everyone really agreed on this.

57:39.040 --> 57:44.400
All the states could agree to fight off the encroachment of the British Empire and keep

57:44.400 --> 57:49.320
them basically in Canada because they couldn't get them out of Canada, but that was kind

57:49.320 --> 57:52.320
of how it was.

57:52.320 --> 57:53.320
Sorry.

57:53.320 --> 57:57.920
By revival of federalism, I basically meant revision of federalism because there is some

57:57.920 --> 57:58.920
kind of federalism.

57:58.920 --> 57:59.920
Yes.

57:59.920 --> 58:00.920
A revision, certainly.

58:00.920 --> 58:01.920
Yes.

58:01.920 --> 58:02.920
A revision.

58:02.920 --> 58:03.920
Yes.

58:03.920 --> 58:04.920
A simplification.

58:04.920 --> 58:11.040
Yes, simplification, dramatic simplification because if it's not simplified, I really don't

58:11.040 --> 58:14.960
see any reason why big tech wouldn't take over the role of government.

58:14.960 --> 58:15.960
Right.

58:15.960 --> 58:19.680
It kind of has in a lot of ways.

58:19.680 --> 58:24.320
I don't look at government as, they're like, oh, break up the big tech.

58:24.320 --> 58:26.840
They're not going to do that.

58:26.840 --> 58:32.720
They have this idea that they can run them and they can ride them basically according

58:32.720 --> 58:35.480
to their intention and priorities.

58:35.480 --> 58:39.080
I don't think that's smart either.

58:39.080 --> 58:44.680
The new power and new source of resources basically is data.

58:44.680 --> 58:45.680
It's not oil.

58:45.680 --> 58:46.680
It's not gold.

58:46.680 --> 58:47.680
It's data.

58:47.680 --> 58:54.520
You see this currency that it's going to disrupt the hell out of US dollar and Chinese central

58:54.520 --> 58:56.360
bank digital currency.

58:56.360 --> 59:00.520
They're all decentralized digital information, pieces of information, cryptocurrencies and

59:00.520 --> 59:01.520
Bitcoin.

59:01.520 --> 59:02.520
Right.

59:02.520 --> 59:03.520
Yeah.

59:03.520 --> 59:09.720
There's interesting potential and possibilities there too.

59:09.720 --> 59:14.480
I imagine that we're not very far away from a kid in his garage being able to build a

59:14.480 --> 59:17.000
system of government on his computer.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.080
I imagine we're not very far away from that.

59:19.080 --> 59:20.080
Yeah.

59:20.080 --> 59:21.080
With smart contracts.

59:21.080 --> 59:22.080
Yeah.

59:22.080 --> 59:23.080
Exactly.

59:23.080 --> 59:32.480
It may be possible for us to develop a blockchain based electoral system and currency and basically

59:32.480 --> 59:36.520
that could serve as a kind of federal government, quote unquote.

59:36.520 --> 59:43.000
You'd want to have some kind of backups in real space and time just in case you have

59:43.000 --> 59:47.160
some kind of electronic disaster, a solar flare or something.

59:47.160 --> 59:53.160
You want to have something backed up, but that would serve the purpose at least of basically

59:53.160 --> 59:56.400
everything that the federal government does.

59:56.400 --> 59:59.960
If you're trading that currency, it can just automatically tax you however much you're

59:59.960 --> 01:00:04.160
bringing in according to whatever the policy is.

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:06.760
It may be all automated.

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.760
You wouldn't need any government employees.

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:12.160
It would cost basically nothing.

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:18.120
There's a potential for some amazing stuff to happen with this technology.

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.240
It's really interesting.

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:24.200
There's lots of opportunities, but I think the biggest area where we have problems in

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:31.840
our society is basically in terms of ideology and in our divisiveness as a country.

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:35.040
The founders would call it faction and it was something that they were very against.

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:37.560
They were against the party system actually.

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.240
They didn't want to have political parties.

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:43.680
A lot of them were very much against forming political parties at all.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:49.920
They wanted people just to run their personal merits for office and that was kind of it.

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:54.400
They didn't want there to be these warring parties in this divisive internal fighting

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:58.080
inside of the country, but inevitably it just happened that way.

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:06.680
It seems like a natural outcome of tolerance and diversity as ideology.

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:13.240
You shouldn't be tolerant against intolerant people and diversity has no place for people

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:15.300
who are against diversity.

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:21.320
You can't be like, hey, we accept cancer because it's just natural.

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:27.600
I don't really understand how any nation can survive when you have and I'm saying it as

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.600
an immigrant.

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:33.440
I've been living here five years, four years, I live in Canada 11 years, but I've been to

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.800
other places in the world.

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:41.440
No serious country will allow people who hate that country fundamentally to play the role

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:46.440
of policy makers and lawmakers and leave their borders open and they're like, well, people

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:47.840
need help.

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:49.600
What?

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:56.400
You cannot treat a country and a nation like this and say that this is a serious country.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:00.080
Precisely.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:07.480
Part of that too, the factionalism is that it gets weaponized by commercial interests.

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:12.440
What happens is you have the Democratic Party is all about bringing in all of these underprivileged

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:15.800
people or at least that's how they market it, that's how they sell it, but what they're

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:21.320
really doing is they're getting slave wage labor into the country so that they don't

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:22.320
become-

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.640
You have voters.

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:30.600
You get hooked on slave labor wage and therefore you become dependent on government based on

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:36.560
some kind of a UBI or a food coupon or whatever and then you keep voting for the party that

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:38.880
is feeding you from the palm of their hand.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.160
It's disgusting.

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:45.200
Yeah, it is.

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:50.520
That being said though, if our government was managed correctly, we could handle bringing

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:52.400
in as many immigrants as we wanted to.

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:55.960
If we had a public works program that just made sure that everybody had housing and everyone

01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:01.360
was employed all the time, yeah, we could bring in as many people as we wanted to.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:06.000
Because we have so much natural resources in this country, we could literally do that

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.960
for maybe 100 years and then at that point, maybe it'd probably be too much.

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:18.240
We could manage taking in tons of immigrants if we had a well-managed functioning government,

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:20.760
but the problem is that we don't.

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:25.560
Basically it's run by crooks who are in the private sector and that's basically a big

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:31.600
part of what that problem is.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:37.800
To me, the way to fix this is we need psychedelic people in office who are familiar with the

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:42.000
psychedelic experience and have that inward sense of accountability, responsibility and

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.320
they try to do good just fundamentally as a character.

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:49.800
I totally agree with that and I think that's the moral high ground basically to say that

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:55.040
I've done psychedelics and I face my demons, my shadows.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:59.600
How far do you think we are as a society for someone to run in this platform?

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:05.800
I am psychedelic conscious to the table.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:06.800
I don't know.

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:12.160
It's funny and it's meme-worthy, who knows?

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:21.160
I think that's a great qualifying point of qualification, I guess.

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:27.240
To have somebody who basically says, yes, I've taken psychedelics, I've faced my demons,

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:32.360
I've looked at the world and I want to try and do good things, it's really simple.

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:33.360
It's really simple stuff.

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:37.880
If you have somebody with the right attitude to go into government and doesn't compromise,

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:42.200
doesn't sell out, you're going to have at least the prospect of sorting a couple of

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:43.960
things out.

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:49.720
I think until you get that psychedelic personality though, and I don't think it can be just one.

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:54.160
I think you need lots of senators, lots of county government people.

01:04:54.160 --> 01:05:00.680
You need people across the board stepping up to the plate and just doing something.

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:05.520
It can't just be one leader, I don't think.

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:08.640
Maybe it could, but that's the whole concept of the Caesar.

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:10.440
I don't know if you're familiar with that or not.

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:11.440
Yeah, right.

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:14.040
Very popular now because people are basically looking for everywhere.

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.040
Right.

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:19.440
If people have problems, they're looking for someone from somewhere to come and fix that

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:21.400
problem without them doing anything.

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.400
Right.

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.400
Yeah.

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:27.560
I think theoretically, I like the idea of the Caesar.

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:28.560
I like the idea.

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:29.560
Yeah.

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:30.560
I like the idea.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:36.960
Add psychedelics into the mix and I'm like, yeah, it's a go, it's a go.

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:44.720
Yeah, it's interesting, but it would be very efficient actually if the country became just

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:49.440
totally willing to hand over that much power to somebody to just basically restructure

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:52.720
the government, basically change everything.

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:55.160
That would be wild.

01:05:55.160 --> 01:06:00.160
You could do a lot with one person.

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.560
That's something I've thought about too.

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:04.840
It's like, what could one person do?

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:05.840
It's an interesting question.

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:07.800
I've thought about it too much maybe, but yeah.

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:08.800
Elon Musk.

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:09.800
Yeah, Elon Musk.

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:16.580
Not to run the country, but the answer to the question, what can one person do?

01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:21.620
The answer is Elon Musk because we are in a different timeline and different reality

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:24.880
after this dude pushed for reusable rockets.

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:27.280
It's a different game completely.

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.280
Yeah, right.

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:29.280
Sure, sure.

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:30.280
Yeah, it's different.

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:34.600
That's what one person can do, but the problem is that there are a lot of people who are

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:42.200
invested in things that those disruptive innovations will disrupt.

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:47.360
These people are in positions of power and I don't believe they can win.

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:52.680
We cannot win against technology, but they're slowing down everything at the cost of the

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:57.280
future and prosperity of the nation that they're supposed to be representing.

01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:58.720
Yeah.

01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:04.720
I think the biggest, like I said, the biggest challenge we have is this religious problem

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:07.560
and this internal division.

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:13.480
I think that once people start uniting around a central principle or an organizational principle,

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:18.440
then naturally you'll have some leadership figures start to emerge that can leverage

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.160
that group.

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:25.720
Right now, there's a big divide and conquer strategy going on that's very effective, I

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:26.720
think.

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:29.040
Very effective in its working wonders.

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:36.960
It has half a country hating the other half and it is a divide and conquer strategy to

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:42.280
get hold of the government and it's remarkable to me that it's gone as far as it's gone and

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:44.800
that people aren't snapping out of it yet.

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:48.800
Personally, I think more than half of the comments and everything on Twitter and YouTube,

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.800
I think they're all fake.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:54.880
I think that lots of the times, these are bot organizations.

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:58.940
They're paying people to go and post and manufacture consent.

01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:03.880
They're smart enough to realize that public opinion is made on places like Twitter, Instagram,

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:08.400
and so they leave comments on anti-regime rhetoric.

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:13.880
If Nicki Minaj, for example, just happened the other day, they leave comments on these

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:21.240
people's pages that make them look like social outcasts or whatever and that politicize everything

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:26.720
that happens in our society because it is a super effective way of keeping everybody

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:33.520
divided and to keep us from coming to what you could call a populist political center.

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:41.020
I think that basically, the Rust Belt is the future of American politics.

01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:45.160
Whatever happens in the Rust Belt, if there is a social or political transformation in

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:50.560
the Rust Belt, it can totally overthrow everything in politics.

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:57.000
For me, as a midwesterner myself, I think one of the reasons I actually wrote my book

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:04.920
is that, look, if we oriented ourselves towards a more fundamentalist paradigm and perspective

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:14.440
in terms of just original, very basic questions about where humans come from, who are we?

01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:18.800
The answer to that question, as far as I can tell, is psychedelics.

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:22.820
Psychedelics are the center of what caused us to become human.

01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:26.120
Maybe there's aliens involved in there somewhere, I don't know, but psychedelics seem to play

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:30.120
a very prominent role through all world history.

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:34.920
Part of the revival of American culture, I think, will involve reclaiming that legacy

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:35.920
in some way.

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:41.280
I absolutely believe it and I've come to a pretty interesting conclusion about George

01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:42.280
Washington.

01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:43.280
I think he was a psychedelic head.

01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:46.520
I really do.

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:48.400
He was friends with Native Americans.

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:54.880
He's smoked from a peace pipe and he has a vision at Valley Forge, which you can read

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:59.720
about, which is totally remarkable and totally interesting, that basically kind of describes

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:02.980
the future of the country in some ways.

01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:07.520
People say it's not historical, it's fake, it was published in the 1850s.

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:16.080
It was published in the 1850s, but it was supposedly told to this journalist by a Revolutionary

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:18.280
War soldier.

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:23.440
It seems kind of unreasonable to me that during the 1850s, kind of during the tumult before

01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:29.840
the Civil War, you're going to have this, basically somebody slandered George Washington

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:36.360
in a Revolutionary War veteran in the same breath with this newsletter that was published

01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:40.960
that basically is George Washington, he's sitting in his barracks at Valley Forge and

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:46.160
he basically starts feeling these weird sensations and he gets sick to his stomach a little bit

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:51.440
and then he has this vision and these angels come and tell him the future of the nation.

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:52.440
It's remarkable.

01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:56.000
It's a psychedelic trip and I think it was like an accurate report of the future in some

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000
way.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:02.480
I can't explain why or how, but I think that that's part of the mystery of this stuff and

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:07.320
it's been used for divination for a long time and probably because it works if you do it

01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:08.320
the right way.

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:13.040
I mean, I don't know if we necessarily know how to do it the way that these people did

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:16.600
in the ancient times or maybe it's just blind luck.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:21.240
Maybe just every once in a while you just get a glimpse into some kind of quantum reality

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:25.120
that allows you to see some kind of potential future or something like this.

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:29.800
I think this happened with George Washington and that's going to be in my second book that

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:30.800
I'm working on.

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:33.560
You can read the story of Valley Forge if you're interested in that.

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:35.960
It's a remarkable story if you haven't read it yet.

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:42.200
I think a lot of people get into psychedelic experiences with some kind of a preconception

01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:43.680
or some kind of a bias.

01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:48.080
They've already made a decision about what is enlightenment, what is God, what is all

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:53.360
these things and they go with that kind of an expectation into the experience and they

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:56.560
get something else and they call it a bad trip or whatever.

01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:01.680
They do it a couple of times, they don't do it again or they keep doing it with kind

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:06.280
of that bias in their head all the time that hey, I got it, I'm enlightened, I know God.

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:10.960
So they start creating their own communities and try to see people wearing the same kind

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:14.920
of clothing, listen to the same kind of music.

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:20.520
But there is also an approach that it's like a feedback loop.

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:24.920
You're in this reality and then you have the kind of a psychedelic experience which is

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:34.800
a mirror into who you really are and then you come back and it's like a, again, technology

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:39.920
and humanity kind of evolution that you evolve with and because of it.

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:45.880
And at some point you got to realize that even psychedelic is a tool because if that

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:51.880
is becoming a God itself then I think you haven't got it because it's the experience

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:58.760
of what is rather than holding on to anything whether it's religion or culture or your identity

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:01.040
or psychedelics or anything like that.

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:08.160
And that's the dilemma really that the core of this kind of thing is in a way pointing

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:13.880
away from the conventional understanding of government and governance that we do have.

01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:18.940
That there is a group of people who are going to be in charge of things and it goes way

01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:26.320
closer to what you're describing the more of a regional, localized kind of structure

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:33.440
but again, it's a system that we have to develop based on our technology and our understanding

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:35.560
and our objective and this time.

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:40.920
Right, right, yeah and I think, I don't know, I have a lot of hope and faith in the younger

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:45.840
generation just because I mean, well, one, they're growing up with the internet, they're

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:50.800
growing up with access to lots of information and they can see through the propaganda and

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:58.400
the bull crap and that's a good, I mean, that's a really good sign.

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:01.440
Things that I see online are just the way kids talk about the government and how they

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:08.680
just have no trust or respect for it is very good as far as I'm good because that's going

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:12.320
to lead to some kind of really radical transformation at some point.

01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:18.600
It's going to end up there and it's going to happen and also the fact that they're open

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:23.400
to people like Joe Rogan and that they're getting this education on Terrence McKenna

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:28.780
and the role of these psychedelic drugs and their potential role in ancient history.

01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:32.000
This is going to train up and raise up like a new generation.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.080
I mean, they used to call it the indigo children, you know, the 90s, right?

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:38.520
I really think it's a phenomena.

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:45.280
I think it's going to really have a huge impact on our cultural footprint in a way.

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:50.120
I think that we're just getting into the stages where it's going to be the case that you have

01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:54.160
these indigo children kind of leadership figures who really start getting serious about like

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:58.760
leading the government and doing things like that because really that's what psychoanalysis

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:01.960
psychedelics were for going back into antiquity.

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:06.480
The reason that, you know, the priests of antiquity took this stuff is because it gave

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:10.040
them insights into the way into reality.

01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:14.560
They could anticipate trends and a big part of how they do it too, which is something

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:18.360
I get to in the book, is that they regionalized it.

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:23.720
They had these ceremonies at temples so you'd have all these people come from all over and

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:27.840
they'd come, they'd have these trips and then they'd explain what they saw in their visions

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:31.900
and that would kind of explain subconsciously like things that they thought and how they

01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:32.900
perceive the world.

01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:37.400
And you could kind of build this map of like what everyone is thinking and the direction

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:39.240
that society is going in.

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:45.840
So it was this very advanced map making ceremony, I think, is what a psychedelic trip was in

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:46.840
a group.

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:51.180
It was, so you'd have these conversations with people and, you know, that's what confession

01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:56.760
was when it came to priests, they would, you know, you get this confession and it was intelligence

01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:57.760
gathering.

01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:02.400
So these temple centers were places where people went to take psychedelic drugs, they

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:04.320
confessed, they told the priests about everything.

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:08.280
So the priest was taking these drugs and integrating all this information and trying not to have

01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:11.200
biases and just see it for what it is.

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:16.360
And the psychedelics were just this way of deconstructing their own thoughts and not

01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:20.040
getting stuck in any kind of paradigm.

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:24.600
I think, at least, that's the way that I see it and it seems like a really magnificent

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:27.960
system that probably worked pretty well.

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:34.000
And another thing that I kind of talk about in my book is that classical architecture

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:39.280
actually is probably more ancient than ancient Greece, probably goes back to the Semitic

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:48.040
and Anatolian regions, and that I basically trace one really big archaeological site to

01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:51.240
King Solomon that is considered to be a Roman site.

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:57.080
But I trace it to King Solomon and actually, I'll just say it's Baalbek.

01:16:57.080 --> 01:17:01.600
I think Baalbek was the temple of King Solomon in the Bible.

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:05.200
And I'm not the only person who thinks this, there's lots of people in Lebanon who just

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:06.200
say this.

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:07.920
This is what the oral tradition in Lebanon is.

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:13.840
It's that Baalbek is the temple of Solomon and they also call it the Tower of Babel.

01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:21.440
And so the Eurocentric view that has been applied to the history of the Middle East

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:22.920
has erased so much history.

01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:26.680
It has erased so much, it's remarkable.

01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:31.800
And it's also kind of mycophobic because the Anglo-Saxon world is kind of very historically

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:33.840
afraid of mushrooms.

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:39.280
So this has caused us to totally black out a piece of this history that is, I think,

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:43.080
absolutely integral to the proper functioning of society.

01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:45.800
What is the cause of that fear?

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:50.160
Well one is that some mushroom species will kill you.

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:54.560
So they're used as poisons in some places in antiquity.

01:17:54.560 --> 01:18:01.160
And the British Empire probably had maybe a larger abundance or maybe there were more

01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:05.760
assassinations that happened through the use of mushrooms, I'm not totally sure, but it's

01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:09.080
definitely an Anglo thing.

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:16.400
And so when that fear just applied to the rest of history, you lose so much, you lose

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:17.400
so much.

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:18.400
It's really amazing.

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:23.400
And Gordon Lawson actually touches on this about the mycophobia of the Anglo-Saxon worldview

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:26.000
is actually what got him interested in his scholarship.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:31.480
He's one of the first mushroom mycologists is that his wife was a Russian and she loved

01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:32.480
mushrooms.

01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:37.640
She picked a bunch of Amanita mysterias on their honeymoon and brought them like a gift,

01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:41.400
like look, we have these drugs we can take and it's our honeymoon, we're going to get

01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:42.680
wild and have a good time.

01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:44.680
And he just flipped out and he lost his mind.

01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:45.680
He's like, are you crazy?

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.680
These are going to kill us.

01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:53.780
So that interaction fascinated him and basically started his career as a mycologist.

01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:55.680
Why the hell did I have that reaction?

01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:59.960
It was my honeymoon and she wasn't worried at all.

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:04.140
And also I think that part of that reaction too is the psychological effect that these

01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:06.080
drugs have on some people.

01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:10.440
If you're not willing to let go of those cultural biases that you have when you go in, you're

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:11.760
going to have a bad time.

01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:14.240
You're going to have a very bad time.

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:18.520
You're going to question who you are, you're going to have all these really hard questions.

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:19.520
Which is the point.

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:21.800
And that's the point, exactly.

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:23.440
So that's part of the funny thing of this.

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:28.840
There's like this natural threshold and this natural barrier that keeps like certain people

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:29.840
out.

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:32.040
It's just this weird, I don't know.

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:33.040
That's the matrix.

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:34.040
That's the cage.

01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:35.040
Yeah.

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:36.040
Right.

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:41.440
And on the other side of it, people have difficulty to define themselves, to identify themselves.

01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:44.160
Yes, yes, yes, yeah.

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:49.280
So you got to be open to that, to not having all the answers right away.

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:53.520
If you're going to take this stuff and you want to do your research and you want to take

01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:56.520
stuff that's not going to kill you if you can.

01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:59.680
And you have to be careful because some of them are deadly.

01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:04.000
If you pick the wrong mushroom and you're out in the forest, not every mushroom is going

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.600
to get you high and give you a good time.

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:06.880
Some of them will just kill you.

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:11.840
And so that's kind of part of the reason why the Anglo-Saxon world is a little more mycophobic.

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:19.120
What are the most significant examples of a psychedelic system, government, society,

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:24.400
civilization throughout history, according to your research?

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:27.560
I would say the Abrahamic religions, actually.

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:30.020
That's what I would say.

01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:33.720
Maybe the colonial government in America as well.

01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:39.080
The Freemasons seem to kind of carry some of that mushroom mysticism.

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:44.840
It seems that was kind of the primary vessel that brought it over to the United States.

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:48.440
But the Native Americans had their own traditions too.

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:51.560
But yeah, definitely the Old Testament government.

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:56.840
Basically the way that it worked is that with Moses, you had the tabernacle.

01:20:56.840 --> 01:21:00.120
You had the high priest and you had the priest around the priest.

01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:05.640
And the tabernacle was where basically people brought animals to be sacrificed to Yahweh.

01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:08.520
But this was a form of actually paying taxes back then.

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:09.720
They were a nomadic society.

01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:13.400
All their wealth was in these livestock animals.

01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:16.720
So what they would do is they'd bring this and then everyone would have a feast on the

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:17.720
Sabbath.

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:22.560
I think it's Saturday for Jewish people, but it's not really correlated to our calendar

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:24.120
so it doesn't really matter.

01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:27.380
But every seven days they'd have some kind of a feast.

01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:29.680
So all the poor people would be able to eat.

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:37.680
It was a kind of redistribution of wealth and you could go to the priest if you had

01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:41.880
a problem, if you were a poor person or let's say somebody committed a crime against you.

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:46.360
You could go to the priest and they'd sort it out.

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:52.400
The temple was a total governmental administrative place where people were taking hallucinogenic

01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:56.480
drugs and that's just how the system works.

01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:58.240
And it worked pretty well in those times.

01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:02.440
Obviously, we're not going to bring sheep to the White House and have them slaughtered

01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:09.760
and have everybody have a feast because that's just not going to work for us today.

01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:15.520
But as a model, it worked back then and you can get those fundamental principles out of

01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:18.440
that religion and you can apply it in a similar way.

01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:19.440
There was charity.

01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:22.720
There was some form of charity and Islam does a good job of this too.

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:25.960
They established the Zakat at least in the early days.

01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:34.520
I think that Islam was largely corrupted pretty honestly and it basically became very non-psychedelic,

01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:39.840
very authoritarian, very against the kind of...

01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:40.840
Political.

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:45.240
Yeah, very political.

01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:48.760
But for a little while, it seemed to really function well and I think that's why it grew

01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:53.840
so quickly and it was adopted so quickly.

01:22:53.840 --> 01:23:00.600
It congealed all these different religions and I think that it was probably more or less

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:03.840
acceptable to take some kind of hallucinogen.

01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:10.440
When you look at Arabic art and Eastern art, very clearly has hallucinogenic influence.

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:15.020
The arabesque is these infinitely repeating patterns, very clearly something that's inspired

01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:20.080
from these fractal geometric figures that you can see under the influence of these drugs

01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:22.560
as far as I'm concerned.

01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:30.520
Then you have drugs like a Syrian roux, particularly in Iran, still commonly used as an incense.

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:37.720
It's got an anti-depressive effect, but it also activates DMT.

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:43.800
Any kind of DMT in your regular food will get a slight activation from that incense.

01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:50.440
You might not necessarily perceive it, but you might recognize it.

01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:52.320
There's drugs all over the Middle East.

01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:55.000
Drugs are a part of some cultures out there too.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Iran, still.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Yeah, sure.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Right, right, right.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Absolutely.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
It's coming right from Afghanistan.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Right.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Yep, yep.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.560
Our next door neighbor was actually, when I was growing up there, he was smoking it

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:12.520
and he would come through our house through air conditioning system.

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:16.520
My mom was getting so pissed and like this guy was smoking opium again.

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:17.520
No kidding.

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:18.520
Yeah, yeah.

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:23.840
There are places, like southern cities, there's one place, Kerman, especially, that when you

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:30.240
go to someone's house, if they want to respect you, they bring you tea and opium and it's

01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:32.360
part of their customary.

01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:33.920
Right, man.

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:38.160
I mean, yeah, those are traditions that probably go back a while, I'd imagine.

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:39.160
Yeah.

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:41.520
I mean, yeah, because why wouldn't you do that?

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:46.480
You have a guest over, you know, get them loaded up and having a good time so they're

01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:49.080
not like judging you or like, you know, being an asshole.

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:52.480
Yeah, you don't do that because, you know, people who run the system, they're like, if

01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:56.240
you do this shit, you don't want to go to a school or join the workforce because they're

01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:57.560
like, why the fuck am I doing that?

01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:02.120
I just sit outside and play flute and look at butterflies and watch the clouds go by.

01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:03.760
It's a good way to live life.

01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:04.760
Right.

01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:05.760
Yeah.

01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:09.160
I mean, personally, I take an attitude of like some moderation.

01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:12.160
You know, I'm pretty moderate about my use.

01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:21.080
But yeah, I mean, it's just been part of human culture forever.

01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:25.680
And it's just ridiculous to have the taboos around it that have been around.

01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:27.400
They're going away now, thankfully.

01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:34.080
But yeah, I share that article with you about how employers in the United States now are

01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:35.520
not requiring drug tests.

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:36.640
Amazon is one of them.

01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:39.400
There's a couple other ones that are jumping on board with that.

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:40.400
For marijuana, at least.

01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:45.400
So, you know, I know people from different countries who are, you know, like let's say

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:51.000
from Iran, the dude knows the Farsi language and knows the cultural context and stuff.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.760
And therefore he could be considered an asset for CIA.

01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:58.080
But the problem is he's done a little too much asset.

01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:59.080
Sure.

01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:00.080
Right.

01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:07.320
So these are not good points of government because somebody who's done a lot of psychedelic

01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:11.840
experiences could be very useful to CIA, for example, you know, the kind of perspective

01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:13.300
that they're bringing.

01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:16.560
But I know for a fact that they're saying marijuana, you shouldn't have smoked for

01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:17.800
the past 12 months.

01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:21.560
I'm using CIA as an extreme example because they say it on their website.

01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:26.200
But other drugs, they're going to have further conversations like, I wonder what other drugs

01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:27.200
are.

01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:30.840
For example, they were like, what have you done, DMT, asset, blah, blah, okay, dude,

01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:34.280
we can't work with you, you know, right off the bat.

01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:37.680
And the FBI, as I mentioned, they were looking for hackers, but they couldn't find anybody

01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:39.240
who wasn't smoking weed.

01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:40.960
So they dropped that requirement.

01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:43.600
Right, right, yeah, yeah.

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:44.600
That's interesting.

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:49.160
I mean, I mean, the whole Silicon Valley thing too, technology as this kind of extension

01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:52.080
of our, of our evolution too, it makes a lot of sense.

01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:57.480
So what you were saying earlier, yeah, I mean, the people in Silicon Valley have been experimenting

01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:58.480
with these drugs.

01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:03.840
I mean, you know, LSD, I mean, that's where the hippie movement really kind of took off.

01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:08.160
I mean, in the 1960s, and that culture has kind of been there in the subculture, I mean,

01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:09.160
the whole time.

01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:12.320
So yeah, it's been going on for a long time.

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:19.100
And that's, that's something that bugs me to high heaven when I hear conservative people

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:24.960
go on these shows and just like talk about how, you know, psychedelic drugs are a menace.

01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:25.960
Hippies were a menace.

01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:29.080
Like, are you, are you crazy?

01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:31.960
Hippies created this world that we live in, in a lot of ways.

01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:36.320
Yeah, they got straight and they went to work and they, you know, but they still, you know,

01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:41.280
smoke joints on the side and they were, they still kept that, that certain kind of rebelliousness

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:44.000
even in their character.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:49.280
And that's part of the whole startup culture is breaking away from that business world.

01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:54.640
And you get a couple people together with computer and you write up some code and you

01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:55.640
create your own thing.

01:27:55.640 --> 01:28:00.600
I mean, this is like this weird, like hippie thing that emerged in Silicon Valley.

01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:08.040
I mean, it's totally like values from the 1960s applied to these, these startups that

01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:13.320
come out of these psychedelic drugs and this, this disregard for the official way of doing

01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:18.880
things on these kind of hierarchical authoritarian systems.

01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:23.280
So it's people totally discredit, not just in American history, but also going back into

01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:28.880
antiquity, the profound role that these drugs had on the development of our thinking and

01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:31.560
the development of our governments and of our technology.

01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:33.840
I mean, it's really remarkable.

01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:38.460
I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if like more than 50% of like all technological innovations

01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:43.080
were from people who had some kind of drug experiences or something.

01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:44.080
Scientific discoveries.

01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:45.080
Exactly.

01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:46.080
Yeah.

01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:47.080
Cause it gets you out of your head.

01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:48.680
It makes you think about things differently.

01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:53.900
And you know, it's a great catalyst for, for that.

01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:58.200
If you have the right mentality for it, you know, but it's also, you know, it's good for

01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:02.680
recreation too, but it's, but it can produce a lot of good for society.

01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:07.880
And it's so annoying to me when you, when these, these right wing conservative guys

01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:13.400
just get so serious about ridiculous and they're very blind, both about technology and about

01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:17.640
psychedelics because you know, you don't have to go that far to see them.

01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:23.280
More veterans are dying out of the battlefield here in the United States than they have died

01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:28.320
in battlefield and a lot of it is because they don't have access to the right kind

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:29.320
of medicine.

01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:33.440
You know, there's a documentary made about these two veterans who came back and one of

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:38.080
them got hooked on, I think, opium and they ended up doing ayahuasca.

01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:40.760
I think one of them did, or two of them did ayahuasca.

01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:45.240
One of them did MDMA, MDMA therapy.

01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:49.360
And they're like, I can't believe it that how much it has helped.

01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:53.880
And all those years that we got hooked on pharmaceuticals and all this chemical nonsense

01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:58.000
that, you know, basically little by little destroyed us.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Right.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Yeah.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.320
People are waking up and they're seeing these alternatives and people are talking about

01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:04.320
it too.

01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:10.760
And so it's spreading this, the awareness that, you know, the corporatized, you know,

01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:14.480
way of doing things in America is just doesn't work at all.

01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:18.440
It just doesn't fundamentally work and that there's other alternatives and that really

01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:23.840
the 1960s, the people in the 1960s were onto something, but that whole revolution was put

01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:24.840
down.

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:31.360
I think we almost had this kind of grand revolution in the 60s, like, but it was all put down

01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:33.240
by the CIA, basically by the deep state.

01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:39.320
You had JFK get assassinated, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, a lot of other people were

01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:44.140
literally assassinated for having the wrong views and the wrong ideas who worked their

01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:49.160
way into positions of massive social and cultural influence.

01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:51.720
I don't think, I think that it's going to happen again, but I don't, I think it's going

01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:57.040
to be so widespread and the, I think that the government's ability to muster some kind

01:30:57.040 --> 01:31:01.080
of militarized response to this is going to be nil.

01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:05.440
There's going to be no way that they're going to be able to respond to the, this kind of

01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:08.640
what I think is going to be a resurgent psychedelic revolution.

01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:09.920
I really think it's going to happen.

01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:14.920
I think it's, we're in the, in the throes of it to a certain extent now, because I mean,

01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:20.960
really people kind of adhere to the conservative party to some extent, but in another 10 or

01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:25.800
20 years, most of the conservative party line is just going to be over.

01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:26.800
It's going to be gone.

01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:28.480
It's going to have no relevance.

01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:30.640
Conservative party, you're talking about Republicans?

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:32.640
Yeah, the conservative Republicans.

01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:33.640
Yeah.

01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:35.160
It's going to be pretty much over.

01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:40.240
There's a couple of young people who are kind of still carrying the line, but like, or toeing

01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:44.600
the line, I guess, but it's, it's not going to have influence.

01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:49.400
The religious people are going to gravitate towards, if anything, I think like a version

01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:55.940
of like Orthodox Christianity, which is like an Eastern form of Christianity.

01:31:55.940 --> 01:32:02.080
But the whole neocon thing is politically just so reprehensible.

01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:05.280
I think it's going to be over very soon.

01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:09.720
I mean, that's my, my take on it at least, but you mentioned six season revolution and

01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:15.120
all that in the series of books that I also like to mention in this conversation is the

01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:21.320
psychedelic experience by Timothy Leary and manual based on the Tibetan book of the dead.

01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:27.920
It's really interesting, especially if you read it on acid, quite a journey.

01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:33.120
He's the guy, you know, he, uh, his, his, uh, have you read his autobiography?

01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:34.120
I don't think so.

01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:36.600
No, no, it has the best title.

01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:37.600
It's flashbacks.

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:39.600
That's the title of it.

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:40.600
It's so funny.

01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:46.440
It makes me laugh every time I think about it, flashbacks, super funny.

01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:50.080
Do you, um, do you feel politically homeless?

01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:51.800
Oh, for sure.

01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:58.040
I mean, in some way I, at the same time, I'm not super political.

01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:04.240
I guess I, the one way, you know, watching these podcasts is very heartening to me.

01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:09.400
I think that it's not political yet, but like all there's a lot of podcasts, Joe Rogan,

01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:15.680
Jordan Peterson, you know, Jocko Willink, these guys who are kind of, you know, right

01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:20.840
leaning in some ways, but not necessarily they had, they're open to a lot of different

01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:22.960
ideas and ways of looking at the world.

01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:23.960
Yeah.

01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:26.560
They look right leaning because the left has gone insane.

01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:28.560
Yes, precisely.

01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:29.560
Yes.

01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:30.560
Yes.

01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:34.640
And, um, yeah, the, I mean, there is no left anymore.

01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:36.200
I mean, there really isn't.

01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:39.720
It's just, these are just corporate sphuges is all it is and liberty.

01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:40.720
That's what it is.

01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:41.720
Yeah.

01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:42.720
It's amazing.

01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:43.720
It's amazing to me.

01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:45.680
I mean, I live in Minneapolis, so I mean, it's amazing to me.

01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:50.320
What I've, what I've seen is just like, it's just amazing.

01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:56.920
Like how ridiculous the whole, you know, BLM crap is, it's just so ridiculous.

01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:57.920
They're corporate stooges.

01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:02.360
I mean, this organization is paid for by these international organizations.

01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:08.960
It's I mean, leftism used to be about contesting authority and contesting, uh, corporate authority

01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:09.960
and overreach.

01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:12.040
And it has nothing to do with that anymore.

01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:13.040
It's all about towing.

01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:14.040
Yeah.

01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:15.040
It's bizarre.

01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:17.040
It's totally bizarre.

01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:18.040
Yeah.

01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:19.040
And I don't know, man.

01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:23.960
I mean, one thing I'm optimistic about is that there's lots of like, you know, uh, mixed

01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:28.720
race and minority people who are openly speaking out against this, like, yo, this does not

01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:31.200
represent me at all.

01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:32.920
And that is a good sign.

01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:36.440
Like the democratic party has totally alienated itself.

01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:40.040
Um, and yeah, I'd prefer the conservative view on things.

01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:44.720
I just wish they'd be a little bit less, uh, insane about some of their biblical positions.

01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:49.120
I think that is, I literally think that there's a mental illness and conservativism.

01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:51.400
That's just, that is just crazy.

01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:56.600
Well, I mean, any kind of a fundamentalism, you know, this is a part of the story that

01:34:56.600 --> 01:35:01.920
children who went to pleasure Island have begun turning into donkeys.

01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:06.220
So some people are saying that, Hey, the solution is in the belly of the whale.

01:35:06.220 --> 01:35:10.400
So we got to go back to the belly of the whale, where, which is, you know, fundamentalism

01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:11.400
and all those things.

01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:17.680
But these people forget that Pinocchio and Geppetto got out of the whale by lighting

01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:21.040
the fire and fire is a piece of technology.

01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:24.840
So they ignore that part altogether that, Hey, we got to get to the whale and we got

01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:25.840
to be safe.

01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:28.080
No, you're not going to be saved.

01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:29.080
That's a problem.

01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:35.120
But when you hold onto something in this ocean of uncertainty that we're swimming in, you

01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:37.880
know, you're holding onto it because you need a sense of identity.

01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:39.600
You need a sense of purpose.

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:42.440
You need a sense of direction, ethics and morality.

01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:46.560
And I think that is completely outdated and broken.

01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:52.000
The way that we have treated it in a conventional sense of the way and psychedelics again, I'm

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.200
not suggesting anybody to do it or not do it.

01:35:55.200 --> 01:36:01.020
I I've done it many, many times for many, many years and it's done wonders for me.

01:36:01.020 --> 01:36:05.360
But I also had experiences that I could consider, you know, bad trips or whatever, but they

01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:06.360
were all tough ones.

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:07.360
Yeah.

01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:08.760
It's all part of the puzzle.

01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:13.720
You know, you realize that in hindsight that actually I'm glad that I went through that

01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:14.720
kind of experience.

01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:15.720
Exactly.

01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:16.720
Yeah, for sure.

01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:17.720
Yep.

01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:18.720
Yep.

01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:22.120
It's it's part of the process of learning how to handle it too.

01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:26.520
And because, you know, especially those first ones, I think are real tough for people because

01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:27.920
we're indoctrinated in our culture.

01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:30.320
I mean, we're totally fed bull crap.

01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:35.320
And so those first encounters you have with psychedelics are going to challenge you for

01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:41.320
sure, because it's it's going to show you how much this our society is bullshit.

01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:47.040
I mean, it's I mean, at least that's that's kind of my reflection on my earlier experiences

01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:52.200
was that it really kind of it was kind of disassociative in some ways.

01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:55.800
But once you kind of work through it and I took a break from it for a while and I kind

01:36:55.800 --> 01:37:00.520
of reflected on it, I realized, you know, like, yeah, there's a lot of stuff that I

01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:06.360
do in my personal life that's just like attached to this like fake cultural edifice, you know,

01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:10.280
that that I don't need to do, you know.

01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:14.760
So it's a part is a part of everyone's own process.

01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:17.120
And it's something that you have to figure out for yourself and you got to be kind of

01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:18.560
brave if you're going to do it.

01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:23.080
And so do your research, read Terrence McKenna, you know, that's that's a good place to start,

01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:24.080
at least.

01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:25.080
Yeah, really.

01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:30.640
McKenna and Alan Watts, I went through a couple of years of just these two.

01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:34.800
If I want to consider anybody as my guru, I don't believe in that concept, but these

01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:35.800
two would be it.

01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:36.800
You know, it's just.

01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:37.800
Yeah.

01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:38.800
Same.

01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:39.800
Yeah.

01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:40.800
Same.

01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:41.800
Yeah.

01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:42.800
Terrence, for me, for sure.

01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:43.800
Yeah.

01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:44.800
Yeah.

01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:45.800
How old were you when you had your first experience?

01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:46.800
And with what substance?

01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:47.800
I was 18.

01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:51.200
And I took some LSD with a couple of friends.

01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:53.560
Yeah, it was pretty interesting.

01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:57.600
I was in art school, so it's you know, it was kind of all around there.

01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:58.600
Yeah.

01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:04.000
So in LSD, I found to be a little bit more aggressive than psilocybin.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:11.200
I think psilocybin is a lot less aggressive and a lot less analytical as well.

01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:14.080
LSD is very analytical.

01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:17.800
So I think psilocybin is probably a better first run.

01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:21.840
If I could go back and change, I probably would have done psilocybin first just to kind

01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:25.560
of warm up a little bit because LSD is just, I found it to be really intense.

01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:26.560
But yeah.

01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:27.560
All right.

01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:36.360
Adam's book is called Eden and Enthugen, Psychedelic History from the Bronze Age to the 1960s.

01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:40.520
It's available for free on archive.org.

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:45.160
And I'm showing you guys now that you can flip through the pages digitally and you can

01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:48.440
even listen to it being read by an AI voice.

01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:51.240
Are you aware of that on archive.org?

01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:52.240
I did not know that.

01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:55.880
It's just like auto, auto-generated voice.

01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:56.880
Is that new?

01:38:56.880 --> 01:38:58.600
I hadn't even tried that.

01:38:58.600 --> 01:38:59.600
Yeah.

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:00.600
Interesting.

01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:02.440
I just tested it before coming on.

01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:03.440
Oh, okay.

01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:05.240
So yeah, it's working.

01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:10.160
Hey, what were some of the main sources of your research for the book?

01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:15.360
Well, basically, the majority of the book is actually a commentary just on Old Testament

01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:16.360
verses.

01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:17.960
So you'll see an Old Testament verse.

01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:22.400
I'll give some commentary on it, and it's just to cruise you through like a couple hundred

01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:28.440
years of biblical history and just give all the important psychedelic moments and points

01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:31.960
and kind of tie it back to Terrence McKenna.

01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:35.160
There's a couple other people that I reference periodically.

01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:38.320
One of my favorites is Michael Hudson.

01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:39.960
He's a Minnesotan too.

01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:45.860
Michael Hudson did this scholarship on ancient Sumerian economies.

01:39:45.860 --> 01:39:53.040
And basically, he did this Harvard study with these Harvard researchers, and they analyzed

01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:58.600
the cuneiform tablets, and they figured out how the economy in these ancient Sumerian

01:39:58.600 --> 01:39:59.600
city-states worked.

01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:04.680
And it's really interesting.

01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:07.160
It's very counterintuitive how it worked.

01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:08.160
It's really interesting.

01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:12.620
And so I incorporate a little bit of that into the book of how these ancient temple

01:40:12.620 --> 01:40:16.640
complex cultures manage their economies, because they had managed economies.

01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:19.760
It wasn't like barter and trade or anything like that.

01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:23.160
The ancient Sumerians had priests, and they set prices.

01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:27.740
And the temple was also a storehouse, as well as a place where they took psychedelics.

01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:33.920
So it was this all-purpose marketplace, government headquarters, religious temple, is really

01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:39.400
an interesting way of managing a society, really.

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:44.160
And it kind of all makes sense that that's actually where markets originated.

01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:49.880
It was in these temples, in these storehouses, where you stored grain, where you stored precious

01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:53.820
metals, you stored all kinds and fabrics as well.

01:40:53.820 --> 01:40:57.840
And that it was psychedelic people who, again, were managing this.

01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:01.920
He doesn't do the psychedelic thing, but I tie it into my general analysis of how the

01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:02.920
Bible worked.

01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:04.880
And it just makes sense that you'd have...

01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:06.520
These were religious centers as well.

01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:10.040
So yes, of course, you're going to have these people taking these drugs there.

01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:16.420
So I tie my theories into some prominent scholars like Michael Hudson in unique ways that haven't

01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:20.200
really been done yet, but I don't know.

01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:21.720
It's a little bit dense, and it's really just...

01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:26.040
It's kind of for the academic heads up there in some ways.

01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:27.560
And you're working on a new book.

01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:28.560
Yeah.

01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:33.000
The second one is a follow-up, because this book is 600 pages, but it just gets up to

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.240
the Book of First Kings in the Old Testament.

01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:42.880
So the next book is going to really cruise through Christianity, Islam, colonial America,

01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:46.840
and some of the Greek and Roman legends as well, because you have psychedelic stuff going

01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:47.840
on there.

01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:52.640
So what the point is, is to show the continuity of the psychedelic system of government that

01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:59.400
starts with Terence McKenna's nomads, and then it turns into ancient Egypt, and then

01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:03.880
you get the Israelites, and then you kind of just kind of follow the thing through.

01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:06.720
And you can see this culture emerging and re-emerging.

01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:08.760
It's really, really interesting.

01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:14.080
And I think you can follow points of collapse when people abandon this lifestyle of taking

01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:18.480
these hallucinogens, because that's what keeps you in touch with reality in some way.

01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:21.880
Or at least you have to have a few people who are doing it periodically.

01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:24.040
It's not like they have to do it all the time.

01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:25.360
You just have to have that.

01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:29.360
You have to have some people who are reevaluating things and saying, okay, wait, maybe we're

01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:32.620
not doing things right here or there or whatever.

01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:37.480
So once the society becomes decadent, they stop caring about that kind of self-reflective

01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:40.640
instinct, that's when you get collapsed.

01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:42.200
I think that's what we're dealing with today.

01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:46.000
So I think it's totally relevant to what our society is going through.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Yeah.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:52.200
On the second book, so you're basically exploring the psychedelic systems of governance.

01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:57.760
Yeah, it gets a little bit more detailed because as you move forward in history, you get more

01:42:57.760 --> 01:42:59.600
records and references.

01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:02.920
One of the interesting things that I found recently was Mormonism.

01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:09.000
A lot of people, South Park, for example, did all kinds of jokes about Mormonism just

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.320
being like literally insane.

01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:16.120
This guy's crazy, he had visions, God was talking to him.

01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:21.680
But looking at it again, it's just remarkable.

01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:25.120
The guy had these relationships with these Native Americans.

01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:30.720
He had these visionary experiences and it seems that he appropriated some of these interesting

01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:36.920
psychedelic symbols from the early colonial period and he was very much about herbal healing.

01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:44.040
He had an herbalist in his kind of cult and he was very much about herbal healing.

01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:50.520
There's some sculptural reliefs that indicate some different psychedelics.

01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:54.920
So saving some of that for the second book, it's really interesting, but you see it everywhere.

01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:59.840
If you really look for it, this is at the center of these religious movements and it's

01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:00.840
interesting.

01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:04.360
I mean, Utah now is like a totally kind of unique state.

01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:05.520
It's a Mormon state.

01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:08.640
It has its own governing principles.

01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:12.920
It has its own religious sense of orientation.

01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:18.000
So you have potential to do something like what Joseph Smith did and recreate some kind

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:21.240
of cultural renaissance with psychedelics.

01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:26.760
So you can kind of look at these historical figures and you can model some potential outcome

01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:31.360
of a new emergent kind of civilization.

01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:36.760
So it's kind of interesting to read through history that way and see those models, I think.

01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:41.640
Mormons are very interesting because of the way that they define God, that God is basically

01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:45.200
an enlightened man, so anybody can become a God.

01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:53.960
And because of that, they also have Mormon transhumanist association.

01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:58.480
The more fundamentalist Mormons, they're not very friendly towards them.

01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:05.840
So it's not like they're united, but this definition of the core, their God has allowed

01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:11.680
for a lot of different innovation for lack of a better word within that context, within

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:14.040
that religious context.

01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:15.200
Right.

01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:16.760
It's such an interesting religion.

01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:21.480
I mean, some of the stuff that they believe is just so far out, I just laugh every time

01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:22.480
I just...

01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:27.020
I mean, one of the things was, apparently Joseph Smith said that there were people living

01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:30.640
on the moon that looked like Quakers who are like...

01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:31.640
It doesn't surprise me.

01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:32.640
Yeah.

01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:37.000
He's like said the craziest things and I'm like, yes, exactly.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:41.360
I've thought about converting to Mormonism just because it's so awesome, it's so out

01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:43.040
there and so crazy.

01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:44.040
It's great.

01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:45.040
I think it's so funny.

01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:50.720
Hey, Adam, where can our audience follow your work?

01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:54.600
And you already said what's next for you because that's also the question that I ask along

01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:55.600
with this one.

01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:56.600
Right.

01:45:56.600 --> 01:46:00.520
Next for you is your new book and where can people follow your future works and future

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:01.520
endeavors?

01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:04.560
Well, I upload onto Internet Archive.

01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:10.000
So you can follow me on Internet Archive if you just look up Eden and Entheogens there.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.760
That's basically where I upload all my stuff.

01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:17.840
So if you want to keep in touch and read the book or whatever, you can comment there too.

01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:22.160
And there's also an email address in the...

01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:28.600
Like on one of the first pages of the book, Eden and Entheogens at protonmail.com, I think.

01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:30.480
So yeah.

01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:32.720
So that's probably the best way to get in touch if you want to.

01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:34.520
I'm not like super savvy with social media.

01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:39.200
I do it a little bit, but I'm not like, I don't know, I'm not building a following or

01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:42.120
building anything like that.

01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:43.360
Well this was awesome, man.

01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:46.960
Thanks for coming up and thanks for reaching out.

01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:49.640
Hopefully I'll have you back for your second book.

01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:53.800
We talk about the images and some more that you sent as well.

01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:55.720
Yeah, that'd be cool, man.

01:46:55.720 --> 01:46:56.720
Yeah.

01:46:56.720 --> 01:46:57.720
I had a great time.

01:46:57.720 --> 01:46:58.720
Thanks for having me on.

01:46:58.720 --> 01:46:59.720
Yeah.

01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:01.880
Let me ask you the final question I ask all my guests.

01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:06.240
If you come across an intelligent alien from a different civilization, what would you say

01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:14.720
is the worst thing humanity has done and what would you say is their greatest achievement?

01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:15.720
That's such a hard question.

01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:20.080
I don't know, because I don't like to do the absolutes too much.

01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:24.840
The worst thing, oh my gosh, just, I don't know, the past 50 years of American culture

01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:29.920
and civilization basically since they destroyed the 1960s I think is probably one of the worst

01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:32.720
things that's ever happened.

01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:37.320
It's just spiritually it's just decimated so much.

01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:41.480
People are smart and they find a way to work around it, but yeah, there's been a really

01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:46.800
severe system of control in place I think basically since the Nixon administration at

01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:47.800
the very least.

01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:51.760
I think it probably goes back a little further, but that's the worst.

01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:57.880
The best thing that we've ever produced, oh man, that's a tough question.

01:47:57.880 --> 01:48:02.760
I think it's part of the size of the 1960s, but I think computers are just marvelous.

01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:06.760
I just think computers are just incredible.

01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:11.640
Some of the coolest things as far as material things we've produced, I'd say computers,

01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:16.040
but also I might say classical architecture because I just thought I love classical architecture,

01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:35.720
so somewhere in between there, yeah.

01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:53.080
Thank you.
