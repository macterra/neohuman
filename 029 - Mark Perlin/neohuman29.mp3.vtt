00:00.000 --> 00:03.840
it's one thing to use genetics to try to cure disease,

00:03.840 --> 00:07.560
it's another thing to change the genetics of our species.

00:07.560 --> 00:11.280
How do you feel about that, changing the genetics of our species?

00:11.280 --> 00:16.280
Well, I'll tell you, it makes no biological sense.

00:23.800 --> 00:28.280
Hello and welcome to the 29th episode of Neohuman Podcast.

00:28.280 --> 00:32.160
I'm Agabahari Adygologist on Instagram and Twitter,

00:32.160 --> 00:37.960
and you can follow the show on liveinlimbo.com, iTunes, and YouTube.

00:37.960 --> 00:42.760
With me today again is Mandy Gray, and with us today we have Dr. Mark Perley,

00:42.760 --> 00:45.320
and thank you so much for your time, Mark.

00:45.320 --> 00:47.040
You're welcome, glad to be here.

00:47.040 --> 00:50.760
Why don't we start by hearing some of your background,

00:50.760 --> 00:56.840
some of the work that you've worked on and what you're working on now these days?

00:56.840 --> 00:59.600
My background is in science and medicine.

00:59.600 --> 01:06.920
I have two PhDs, one in computer science and one in mathematics and a medical degree,

01:06.920 --> 01:13.920
and the work that I've done over the years has been in computer science and genetics

01:13.920 --> 01:18.200
at Carnegie Mellon University, and for the last 20 years,

01:18.200 --> 01:22.800
I've been working at my small company here in Pittsburgh,

01:22.800 --> 01:28.520
we have about 10 people, on getting more information out of DNA data

01:28.520 --> 01:31.840
using computers and statistics.

01:31.840 --> 01:38.680
So when you say DNA data, what are the major uses or what is it used for?

01:38.680 --> 01:44.680
Originally, when we started in the 1990s, it was for genetic diagnosis,

01:44.680 --> 01:49.800
gene mapping, and genome projects, but over the last 15 years,

01:49.800 --> 01:54.040
it's mainly been for forensic identification.

01:54.040 --> 01:59.720
Mark, how have you seen the change in the field with the advancement

01:59.720 --> 02:04.400
of the technology in the past decade, especially in your field?

02:04.400 --> 02:07.920
Well, in forensic identification, it's interesting,

02:07.920 --> 02:15.440
the sort of dichotomous split, you have advances in the ability to generate

02:15.440 --> 02:22.080
high-quality data in high volumes in crime labs from low-level DNA

02:22.080 --> 02:28.760
and from mixtures, most DNA evidence is a mixture of two or more people,

02:28.760 --> 02:34.680
and so the data is phenomenal, but there's also been a parallel development,

02:34.680 --> 02:43.280
which we started on over 15 years ago, of using statistical modeling and computers

02:43.280 --> 02:53.120
in order to separate out this data into the genetic types of the individuals

02:53.120 --> 02:58.400
who left their DNA and determine reliable match statistics.

02:58.400 --> 03:03.720
So that's a separate strand, and while laboratories have been very keen

03:03.720 --> 03:13.040
to adopt improvements in laboratory equipment that help them generate more data,

03:13.040 --> 03:22.120
the adoption of technology that will resolve these DNA signals

03:22.120 --> 03:26.320
without human intervention has been a bit slower.

03:26.320 --> 03:29.360
When you're saying that the sample of DNA is a mixture between two people,

03:29.360 --> 03:31.520
what exactly do you mean by that?

03:31.520 --> 03:34.440
Well, here's several examples.

03:34.440 --> 03:42.040
In a sexual assault, there's two people involved or more, a victim and an assailant.

03:42.040 --> 03:46.640
On a handgun, there'll typically be four or five people

03:46.640 --> 03:49.640
who've touched different surfaces on the gun.

03:49.640 --> 03:55.480
So if you take a swab from the handgun, you'll end up with a signal

03:55.480 --> 04:00.600
that doesn't just have the DNA of one contributor, say the owner of the gun,

04:00.600 --> 04:06.960
but will have DNA from the four, five, or six different people

04:06.960 --> 04:08.800
who've all handled that gun.

04:08.800 --> 04:16.280
And so the type of data that you're getting isn't the very easy DNA from one person

04:16.280 --> 04:20.760
that somebody might watch on television or hear about in high school.

04:20.760 --> 04:28.920
It's a more complex signal that adds together the DNA components from multiple people.

04:28.920 --> 04:36.360
I see. The common belief is that a lot of wrongfully convicted people,

04:36.360 --> 04:40.520
that could have been avoided if we had a more conclusive kind of an evidence.

04:40.520 --> 04:46.480
And DNA evidence have been always pointed out as more of a conclusive and definitive kind of an evidence.

04:46.480 --> 04:51.240
How accurate that statement would be in your opinion?

04:51.240 --> 04:57.840
Well, the idea is how informative is the information that you're getting.

04:57.840 --> 05:04.800
The methods that crime labs traditionally have used over the last 15 years for DNA mixtures

05:04.800 --> 05:09.720
tend to be limited in that only some of the data is used.

05:09.720 --> 05:16.560
And the conclusions tend to be inclusionary statistically, not exclusionary.

05:16.560 --> 05:24.320
Newer computer methods can provide an exclusionary score showing the extent to which somebody

05:24.320 --> 05:33.600
hasn't contributed their DNA as well as the degree to which someone else may have contributed their DNA.

05:33.600 --> 05:43.840
So these newer methods that are computer based and statistical are a boon for being able to exonerate people

05:43.840 --> 05:51.200
and provide exculpatory evidence that somebody's DNA was not present on an item at a crime scene.

05:51.200 --> 05:58.120
Right. So over the last couple of weeks, we've talked a little bit about the reluctance of the courts to embrace technology.

05:58.120 --> 06:04.120
Has that been your experience or where have the courts landed on the introduction of this evidence

06:04.120 --> 06:11.200
or even just like at the investigative level amongst police officers, for example?

06:11.200 --> 06:22.120
We've seen fairly good acceptance of cyber genetics started out over 15 years ago, doing a lot of validations.

06:22.120 --> 06:32.680
We had a grant from the Department of Justice 15 years ago to validate this mixture separation technology for DNA that we were developing.

06:32.680 --> 06:40.000
And to date, there have been 34 validation studies, seven of them published in peer review journals,

06:40.000 --> 06:54.400
that show the effectiveness of our true allele system in producing reliable match statistics, whether inclusionary or exclusionary.

06:54.400 --> 07:02.440
So when we go to court, if there is some sort of a challenge from an opposition,

07:02.440 --> 07:10.760
then the questions that the court really focus on is what's the scientific reliability?

07:10.760 --> 07:19.800
I don't know if you've talked in your show about issues of courtroom acceptability, such as Daubert or Frye.

07:19.800 --> 07:29.920
But there are certain criteria, certainly in the United States, and they involve typically the general acceptance of a method.

07:29.920 --> 07:41.680
But particularly since 1993 in the Daubert decision, the federal government and most of the states embrace a more scientific criteria for judges to consider.

07:41.680 --> 07:51.080
And the main three criteria are is a method inherently testable or is it not testable at all?

07:51.080 --> 07:58.000
Does it have an error rate? Can you produce an error rate to show how often it succeeds or fails?

07:58.000 --> 08:07.080
And has the method been accepted by peer review and demonstrated to actually work?

08:07.080 --> 08:15.280
So given the emphasis that we have put and other groups as well on validating scientific methods,

08:15.280 --> 08:20.960
that's helped with courts accepting it as of today.

08:20.960 --> 08:34.000
There have been 10 challenges out of the 400 cases we've done, and the courts have accepted Trualiel as reliable scientific evidence in all of those cases.

08:34.000 --> 08:41.720
Right. So you've been called then, I guess, as an expert witness to testify to the validity of it then? Is that how it works?

08:41.720 --> 09:00.040
So in a criminal trial, say in about maybe 5% of cases, an opposition, no matter which side happens to be presenting your evidence, can ask for a hearing.

09:00.040 --> 09:07.720
I think it may be called a voir dire hearing in Canada. That's what it's called in the United Kingdom and in Australia.

09:07.720 --> 09:18.360
And actually, Trualiel has had those voir dires in Northern Ireland and Australia, which went well.

09:18.360 --> 09:24.840
And at those hearings, it's up to the judge, serving as a gatekeeper, to decide on reliability.

09:24.840 --> 09:34.640
In most cases, there is no challenge because the science is seen to be acceptable and a judge will either not allow a challenge

09:34.640 --> 09:43.360
or the opposing side doesn't ask for one because it doesn't get you very far.

09:43.360 --> 09:49.440
I mean, in theory, you could ask for a scientific challenge every time you go to court.

09:49.440 --> 09:52.240
You could ask, does the sun shine during the day?

09:52.240 --> 09:58.880
That could be an objection. And if the judge grants it, you could have a hearing on meteorology.

09:58.880 --> 10:09.520
So you can always challenge evidence. But I think the result of Trualiel having been in the courts for since 2009,

10:09.520 --> 10:18.720
I've testified in almost 50 cases and there are six crime labs in the United States that are using Trualiel regularly.

10:18.720 --> 10:25.600
It sort of has a general acceptance as a valid method and is particularly based on validation studies.

10:25.600 --> 10:33.520
Right. So is it being introduced then by the state prosecutor and then opposed by the defense counsel?

10:33.520 --> 10:35.680
Is that usually how it goes down?

10:35.680 --> 10:45.600
That's usually how it goes. Though this year, we had some interesting cases where we were assisting the defense.

10:45.600 --> 10:57.280
There was one case in upstate New York, which is sort of near you, where we used Trualiel to analyze about 150 items of evidence

10:57.280 --> 11:04.720
in the people of New York versus Nick Hillary case.

11:04.720 --> 11:14.000
And what we helped the defense show was that the evidence that was introduced by the prosecution

11:14.000 --> 11:19.280
was subjective and the answer could have gone either way, depending on the data that was used.

11:19.280 --> 11:30.880
If you used some data, the prosecutor's software could reach one conclusion.

11:30.880 --> 11:35.280
If you use more data, you could reach another conclusion.

11:35.280 --> 11:40.160
And when we ran the same data through Trualiel on all the evidence,

11:40.160 --> 11:45.760
we saw there was no statistical support for the defendant, Nick Hillary, being in the data.

11:45.760 --> 11:51.680
We also had two exonerations in Indiana this year.

11:51.680 --> 11:58.080
The second one is just happening this week. The first one was in April.

11:58.080 --> 12:08.000
And there there was a case of an individual, Darrell Pinkins, and two of his colleagues who were

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
it falsely convicted of a crime they couldn't possibly have committed.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.040
It was a very vicious gang rape.

12:15.040 --> 12:24.960
There was a group of criminals going around in northern Indiana bumping into cars on the motorway.

12:24.960 --> 12:30.000
And when the passenger got out of the car, they would rob them.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.520
And then the robins turned to beatings. Then they turned to rapes.

12:33.520 --> 12:38.080
Then they turned to robbing, rapes, beatings, everything.

12:38.080 --> 12:43.760
And what had happened with Mr. Pinkins and some of his co-workers is that the coveralls,

12:43.760 --> 12:48.080
the uniforms that they had at work, were stolen from their car.

12:48.640 --> 12:54.960
These coveralls were found back in the late 1980s at this crime scene.

12:54.960 --> 13:00.800
And two of them were convicted of participating in the gang rape.

13:00.800 --> 13:07.040
The DNA evidence that would later exonerate them actually existed in 2001.

13:07.040 --> 13:13.520
But the interpretation methods that were used then and are still prevalent now

13:13.520 --> 13:19.120
weren't able to get at the smaller components of the mixture.

13:19.120 --> 13:23.360
They couldn't identify the five or ten percent components.

13:23.360 --> 13:28.560
And after we analyzed the same data from 15 years ago,

13:28.560 --> 13:33.280
because that's what our computer does. We don't work with DNA wet samples.

13:33.280 --> 13:36.240
We just work with the data that comes out of the lab.

13:36.240 --> 13:41.200
We were able to establish that there were five individuals present at this crime scene.

13:41.200 --> 13:44.560
Three of them were brothers and none of them were the defendants.

13:44.560 --> 13:50.880
And so in April, Darrell Pinkins walked out of jail after having

13:51.600 --> 13:54.320
been wrongfully imprisoned for 24 years.

13:54.320 --> 13:59.920
So same evidence, just the interpretation of it was improved because of the technology advancement, correct?

14:00.560 --> 14:01.280
Exactly.

14:03.280 --> 14:09.360
Do you see that all these successful cases is paving the road towards the future where

14:09.360 --> 14:14.720
we're using biology and genetics as primary forms of identification for individuals?

14:14.720 --> 14:17.760
For example, when you go into airport, they're not going to use passports anymore.

14:17.760 --> 14:21.040
They're going to use eye scan or a DNA sample or anything like that.

14:21.040 --> 14:24.960
Well, for DNA, you'd have to have pretty rapid scanning, right?

14:24.960 --> 14:27.600
And there is a technology is also progressing, right?

14:28.640 --> 14:32.960
So we may get to a point where we might be able to do it on the spot.

14:34.160 --> 14:42.800
Yes. And people, manufacturers do develop equipment for rapid DNA scans and it's getting faster.

14:42.800 --> 14:48.960
It's still not at the point where it would be as fast as a retinal scan or a fingerprint.

14:48.960 --> 14:57.440
But do you think there's a possibility that move towards the place in the future where

14:57.440 --> 15:00.480
we don't need to use ID or passport or anything like that?

15:00.480 --> 15:05.120
Our biology, our face facial recognition, our DNA would be our identification factors.

15:05.760 --> 15:08.000
It's already working that way on my new iPhone.

15:09.440 --> 15:14.720
It recognizes my thumb and it activates my credit card.

15:14.720 --> 15:18.480
I guess if somebody stole that and could replicate my fingerprint,

15:18.480 --> 15:20.000
they could buy a new car with it.

15:20.000 --> 15:26.560
But we have some faith that this sort of biometric works even in our everyday life.

15:27.360 --> 15:30.800
So what is happening to the future of data gathering and security?

15:32.240 --> 15:36.800
Because this is getting within inside people's body, right?

15:36.800 --> 15:40.560
People are concerned now that their phone calls are being monitored

15:40.560 --> 15:43.440
or companies can track what they're searching on internet.

15:43.440 --> 15:50.640
How would they feel when, you know, it's their biology, it's their genetics?

15:51.920 --> 15:52.560
I don't know.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.040
It's nothing that we're involved in.

15:56.320 --> 16:01.840
But as you say, there's facial recognition software, there's all sorts of new biometrics.

16:02.480 --> 16:07.680
With DNA, if someone had the resources, you see this at crime scenes.

16:08.320 --> 16:12.480
Suppose a perpetrator leaves someone's house

16:12.480 --> 16:14.720
and then you have video recordings.

16:15.440 --> 16:19.680
This is from a case I was involved in in Pittsburgh earlier this year.

16:19.680 --> 16:23.440
This video recordings of the person walking down the street,

16:24.480 --> 16:27.920
possibly having left this crime scene and shedding clothing,

16:28.640 --> 16:37.440
going to an ATM to get money out and getting into a car.

16:37.440 --> 16:43.920
So there's a history that's left not just in these videos and transactions,

16:43.920 --> 16:51.120
but in the biological materials that from what the person touched,

16:51.120 --> 16:56.960
from the clothing that they wore, from whatever was left as they left the crime scene.

16:57.520 --> 17:00.640
So when you're working on a crime,

17:00.640 --> 17:03.600
obviously you'd want to have all that information

17:03.600 --> 17:06.320
and put it together and figure out who the person was.

17:06.320 --> 17:09.040
But I think what you're discussing is the potential

17:09.040 --> 17:12.720
of imagine that we're five or 10 years in the future.

17:12.720 --> 17:15.200
Speed has increased, costs have gone down.

17:16.560 --> 17:21.360
Is there the potential to check a lot more material

17:22.000 --> 17:25.440
without even having some probable cause to do so?

17:26.320 --> 17:30.080
I would hope that our constitutions and our laws would protect us from that.

17:30.640 --> 17:33.440
But technologically, it would be feasible.

17:33.440 --> 17:38.240
Right. And do you think that that's kind of a no-brainer for general public

17:38.240 --> 17:42.800
to start to educate themselves more about the advancement of technology?

17:42.800 --> 17:46.240
Because most of the people that I'm speaking to,

17:46.240 --> 17:51.760
a lot of these advancement and progress, it's just surprising to them.

17:51.760 --> 17:53.600
They can't believe how far we've come

17:53.600 --> 17:57.680
and they can't believe all the possibilities that are available ahead of us.

17:57.680 --> 18:03.120
And I think it freaks a lot of people out every possibility that exists already

18:03.120 --> 18:06.720
and will continue to exist to interfere in their personal life.

18:07.360 --> 18:10.160
A lot of it for the main purpose of security,

18:10.160 --> 18:14.000
but a lot of people will raise the question of what is happening to privacy?

18:15.280 --> 18:18.080
Well, I think we're all concerned about privacy.

18:19.440 --> 18:23.360
I think when people hear about what technology does for good,

18:23.360 --> 18:28.080
for example, advances in DNA technology that can diagnose disease,

18:28.080 --> 18:31.680
or maybe now with newer CRISPR technology,

18:31.680 --> 18:37.600
the name of the technology is CRISPR technology, possibly cure diseases.

18:38.960 --> 18:44.800
So with the case of forensics, the ability to solve crimes

18:44.800 --> 18:50.160
that could not have been solved before to achieve justice and resolution for victims.

18:52.080 --> 18:55.040
On the positive side, I think people can envision all that.

18:55.760 --> 19:01.600
But the darker side is what happens when these technologies may be used

19:01.600 --> 19:04.080
in ways that people haven't thought of.

19:04.880 --> 19:07.360
For example, with the CRISPR technology,

19:07.360 --> 19:11.200
it's one thing to use genetics to try to cure disease,

19:11.200 --> 19:14.080
it's another thing to change the genetics of our species.

19:14.880 --> 19:17.760
How do you feel about that, changing the genetics of our species?

19:21.440 --> 19:23.760
Well, I'll tell you, it makes no biological sense.

19:24.400 --> 19:25.360
Here's what would happen.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.320
You've seen Gattaca?

19:28.320 --> 19:28.640
Yes.

19:28.640 --> 19:36.080
OK, so in a world like Gattaca, what would happen is that you'd get a narrowing of diversity.

19:37.200 --> 19:41.920
You would have parents or governments or somebody making decisions

19:42.800 --> 19:50.000
to weed out what might be considered bad, in quotes, bad genes and reinforce good genes,

19:50.000 --> 19:53.520
move towards almost a clone-like population.

19:53.520 --> 19:56.640
And that might be seen as good.

19:56.640 --> 20:00.720
But biology and nature doesn't really view that as good.

20:00.720 --> 20:06.720
And when you end up with a few catastrophes, like influenza viruses or other attacks,

20:07.920 --> 20:10.560
that lack of diversity would wipe out our species.

20:11.280 --> 20:14.640
So what seems like a really good idea in the short term,

20:15.600 --> 20:19.120
in the long term, really wouldn't work for a species,

20:19.120 --> 20:22.960
because if we all become too uniform, we lose the diversity

20:22.960 --> 20:26.960
that enables the survival of a species.

20:26.960 --> 20:32.480
What if that decision is made, let's say, by an artificial intelligence based on enormous amount

20:32.480 --> 20:35.520
of data that is impossible for humans to process?

20:35.520 --> 20:40.960
It has to be processed by machine using machine learning or whatever techniques that is going to

20:40.960 --> 20:46.480
arise, and they just, you know, artificial intelligence more and more getting involved

20:46.480 --> 20:51.440
directly in our lives, and they just decide that this would be the better path for humanity.

20:51.440 --> 20:55.120
And we're so dependent on them at some point that we just have to deal with it.

20:55.760 --> 21:01.120
Well, as I said, when technology is used for good, that can be fine.

21:01.120 --> 21:09.280
For example, our Trulio technology is a type of machine learning that mines information out of data.

21:09.760 --> 21:16.080
And when it's used for good, for resolving crime, that's wonderful.

21:16.080 --> 21:23.680
But if you were to rely on computers to decide to make a boneheaded decision for our species,

21:23.680 --> 21:28.160
maybe that would mean the computers are a bit smarter than we'd want them to be,

21:28.160 --> 21:29.840
and they're plotting our extinction.

21:31.280 --> 21:39.920
Certainly, winnowing diversity out of our population through genetics is a very bad idea.

21:39.920 --> 21:42.160
We don't know what genes really do.

21:42.160 --> 21:52.160
We don't know what the evolutionary adaptations can be for any feature that humans have.

21:52.160 --> 21:57.760
But what we do know is that evolution relies on that diversity, that genetic diversity,

21:57.760 --> 22:02.160
in order to maintain survival of a species.

22:02.160 --> 22:05.680
Would it be fair to say that you have concerns about the rise of artificial intelligence,

22:05.680 --> 22:08.880
like Bill Gates or Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking's?

22:08.880 --> 22:13.520
No, I don't think I have a concern about artificial intelligence.

22:13.520 --> 22:17.200
I would have a concern about misuse of artificial intelligence.

22:17.200 --> 22:20.800
The same way I don't have concerns about cars,

22:20.800 --> 22:23.760
but I do have concerns about people running people over with cars.

22:24.640 --> 22:31.040
It's a tool, and unfortunately, as we see in society, some people abuse tools.

22:31.040 --> 22:38.000
So I guess my question is this, where do you see DNA research going in terms of forensics,

22:38.000 --> 22:39.840
and what's next?

22:39.840 --> 22:46.080
Are you looking to expand, or are you looking to look into other areas of research

22:46.080 --> 22:50.880
to exonerate more people, or how do you hear about these cases?

22:53.680 --> 22:59.600
People tend to contact us, and we're not the only ones who contact us.

22:59.600 --> 23:06.640
People tend to contact us, whether they're police, prosecutors, defenders, or innocence projects,

23:08.320 --> 23:14.240
when the methods that their labs are using don't go far enough.

23:15.360 --> 23:18.080
The labs tend to be pretty conservative.

23:19.600 --> 23:25.440
They tend to like methods that confirm what they can see by eye.

23:25.440 --> 23:28.160
This isn't all labs, but it's many crime labs.

23:28.160 --> 23:35.120
Whereas, the information that's contained in data is often beyond what you can see by eye.

23:35.120 --> 23:42.880
I mean, there are so many examples in medicine to see what we can see in a magnetic resonance image,

23:43.440 --> 23:46.080
which I did research on that about 30 years ago.

23:47.840 --> 23:57.600
We rely on MRI scans, and we have magnets and radio waves that can take cross-sectional

23:57.600 --> 24:03.200
of our brains and bodies, and use them in very subtle ways for diagnosis.

24:03.840 --> 24:13.840
If you didn't accept that we could make very good use of data and reconstruct it by machines or

24:13.840 --> 24:20.560
computer intelligence, then you wouldn't have the benefits of probably most medical technology nowadays.

24:20.560 --> 24:32.080
So, we tend to get involved when someone in law enforcement or law needs more information from data.

24:32.080 --> 24:35.760
The nice thing about Tru-Allele is that it's completely objective.

24:35.760 --> 24:41.520
There's been a lot of research and talk about subjectivity and potential bias

24:41.520 --> 24:45.520
when you have complex DNA samples, particularly mixtures.

24:45.520 --> 24:51.440
Those are real concerns that can be confirmation bias or other sorts of bias that human analysts

24:51.440 --> 24:56.960
have. The most common bias is to say nothing and just give no answer at all.

24:56.960 --> 25:03.440
But with Tru-Allele, nobody chooses the data for it.

25:03.440 --> 25:07.440
All the data goes into the machine, and the machine doesn't see the answer.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.640
It doesn't know who you're going to be comparing it with, what their genetic types are like,

25:12.640 --> 25:18.480
the results can be compared against one person, ten, or a database of a million people.

25:18.480 --> 25:22.240
So, objective technology like that is pretty good.

25:23.200 --> 25:30.560
We tend to get called when crime labs have reached their limit of what they're willing to do or what

25:30.560 --> 25:37.520
they're able to do. And then usually through word of mouth or internet, somebody finds out about us

25:37.520 --> 25:39.520
and asks if we can help.

25:39.520 --> 25:45.760
So, I'm assuming it's only the most serious cases that you would be asked to come in on?

25:47.520 --> 25:52.160
We tend to only get involved in serious case. I mean, the most serious case we ever did in some

25:52.160 --> 25:58.800
sense was the World Trade Center disaster, when we were asked by the medical examiner's office in New

25:58.800 --> 26:06.640
York City over 10 years ago to re-examine all the DNA data from the over 18,000 victim remains.

26:06.640 --> 26:15.040
And the DNA that was collected from relatives and personal effects from the 2,700 missing people,

26:15.040 --> 26:24.080
analyzed everything in Trulio, and then make automatic comparisons to identify the victim remains.

26:24.080 --> 26:27.680
How long does that take to identify that many people?

26:27.680 --> 26:32.400
Well, it was a project. We scaled up, we built a supercomputer for it.

26:32.400 --> 26:41.520
It was the first of that type with our current Trulio architecture can work on 50 or 100 problems

26:41.520 --> 26:48.800
simultaneously. And we first built a machine for that when we started on that re-analysis task

26:49.840 --> 26:55.840
10 years ago. So, I'd say maybe it took, the whole effort probably took at least a year

26:55.840 --> 27:01.760
of entering the data, asking the computer the questions. For the computer to answer the

27:01.760 --> 27:08.960
questions, solve the DNA questions, make the comparisons, and get the numbers,

27:08.960 --> 27:16.000
that wasn't as much work as its computer. But just getting the data, it ended up being about

27:16.000 --> 27:26.240
100,000 samples of data that had to be entered into the system in a reliable way.

27:26.240 --> 27:30.240
And this is something that would have been impossible without the use of the machines, correct?

27:30.240 --> 27:36.480
Certainly, in the way that we did it. You can have a huge effort and do a lot of things manually,

27:36.480 --> 27:41.200
but you won't get as much information. You are correct that we tend to only work on

27:41.200 --> 27:51.120
more high-profile cases, or cases where it's important to get a resolution.

27:51.120 --> 27:58.720
We can think of any number of examples. You have a serial rapist who's terrorizing a town.

27:58.720 --> 28:04.880
There's a lot of DNA. The crime lab can't interpret it, but once it's gone through the

28:04.880 --> 28:11.680
truly ill process, and the evidence can be compared against evidence, it can be compared

28:12.480 --> 28:21.920
with databases. There are issues with databases due to government's reluctance to use newer

28:21.920 --> 28:31.520
technologies. We haven't seen that in Canada. By being able to have computers resolve the evidence

28:31.520 --> 28:39.120
and separate out the mixtures and make comparisons, determine what items are not matching people,

28:39.120 --> 28:46.080
or what items are not matching items, we can really map out a crime scene and get a sense

28:46.080 --> 28:49.200
of what's been happening and who are the different players.

28:49.200 --> 28:54.400
Mark, as someone who's dealing with genetics, basically the basis of humanity,

28:54.400 --> 28:58.720
do you see ethics and morality as objective or subjective?

28:58.720 --> 29:05.840
That's an interesting question. I think everybody has their own morality, and I know there are

29:05.840 --> 29:11.360
different systems of ethics. Once you would have more than one system of ethics, if people can

29:11.360 --> 29:15.520
adopt which ones they want to choose, you now have some subjectivity.

29:15.520 --> 29:20.560
We have this conversation in many episodes, and my main follow-up question would be,

29:20.560 --> 29:23.600
then how do you think it will translate into the media?

29:23.600 --> 29:29.440
One of the provincial methods that some people are talking about of controlling artificial

29:29.440 --> 29:33.120
intelligence is applying our own ethics and morality into the machine, so they know what

29:33.120 --> 29:39.920
killing is bad. If you're driving in a road and three people are there and one child is there,

29:39.920 --> 29:44.240
which direction should you go to? What are your thoughts about that?

29:44.240 --> 29:46.880
I think you'd be at the mercy of the programmers.

29:46.880 --> 29:56.400
In the sense that there are many possible answers. Sometimes what people would decide

29:56.400 --> 30:03.360
would be an ethically correct decision may depend on information that you're not giving

30:03.360 --> 30:09.040
a program, or it doesn't have access to.

30:09.040 --> 30:18.800
I mean, you have all these hypotheticals, right? Is it okay to ever take a human life?

30:18.800 --> 30:24.320
Well, then you get the, but what if you had a time machine and you could kill Hitler?

30:24.320 --> 30:32.480
We obviously are taking away many human lives on a daily basis using technology to do it easier and safer.

30:32.480 --> 30:40.160
Yes, and then there are ethical issues of should we be using technology to prevent that sort of wholesale killing?

30:40.160 --> 30:46.080
I mean, one of the ethical issues that we've seen in the Middle East with Syria is,

30:46.080 --> 30:52.960
which you read about all the time, is what should have been the ethical obligation on the part of

30:52.960 --> 30:59.040
various, you know, different ways in which we could have done that?

30:59.040 --> 31:08.320
The ethical obligation on the part of various large powers to somehow intervene in the wholesale slaughter there.

31:08.320 --> 31:16.080
That was a place where technology might have helped, and yet it was humans who made decisions not to help

31:16.080 --> 31:23.520
and not to deploy that technology. You could call it natural intelligence or natural stupidity,

31:23.520 --> 31:29.920
as opposed to artificial intelligence. But people make decisions all the time

31:29.920 --> 31:34.240
that can affect thousands or hundreds of thousands of lives.

31:34.240 --> 31:38.560
A lot of the job of interpretation is being done by machine, if I understand it correctly,

31:38.560 --> 31:41.520
and a lot of job of data gathering is being done by humans.

31:41.520 --> 31:46.560
Do you think that also data gathering needs more technology and more machines involved

31:46.560 --> 31:52.640
instead of humans to maybe minimize the mistakes and faults?

31:52.640 --> 31:58.800
We don't see too many mistakes in the data gathering with DNA evidence.

31:58.800 --> 32:04.640
One of the reasons it's really not much of a problem, particularly with true allele interpretation,

32:04.640 --> 32:14.960
is suppose that there's a possible fault that would be that the police officer or the analyst,

32:14.960 --> 32:20.320
DNA analyst, collecting the sample contaminates the DNA.

32:20.320 --> 32:25.520
So instead of there being the original two people, say the victim and the perpetrator,

32:25.520 --> 32:30.720
who'd left their DNA on an item, now you have a third person.

32:30.720 --> 32:39.040
Well, if the lab is using interpretation methods where they can't do anything about that contaminant,

32:39.040 --> 32:44.720
about the person who left their DNA by accident, who is collecting the sample,

32:44.720 --> 32:49.920
then that's a mistake. On the other hand, if you use technology like true allele,

32:49.920 --> 32:54.400
that says, okay, well, there's one more contributor in there, just to count for them

32:54.400 --> 33:01.440
and factor out that extra contribution so we can focus on what was actually happening at the crime,

33:01.440 --> 33:08.960
then what might have been a mistake using better technology that can separate out components from

33:08.960 --> 33:19.200
data is no longer a mistake. So we don't really see mistakes of that kind. We may see more complex data,

33:19.200 --> 33:26.320
but then we just aim the computer at it and it solves it as best it can.

33:26.320 --> 33:34.480
You guys just had an election down there. And one of the main issues, if not the main issue,

33:34.480 --> 33:42.640
was jobs. And one of the arguments against what Trump proposes is that a lot of those jobs are

33:42.640 --> 33:46.960
not going to come back because they will be automated. What are your thoughts about how

33:46.960 --> 33:52.000
technology is replacing jobs? I don't know if it's happening as much in your field as well,

33:52.000 --> 33:57.600
but in many other fields, it's a big threat to a lot of people. What are your thoughts on that

33:57.600 --> 34:01.280
automation and the future of job and how is it going to affect our society?

34:02.320 --> 34:07.280
Well, I've heard different people talking about this. There are some people who are looking

34:07.280 --> 34:12.720
forward to the day in the near future where artificial intelligence and machines have

34:12.720 --> 34:19.600
eliminated the need for work entirely. I certainly don't see that in my weekly existence. I can

34:19.600 --> 34:25.360
easily go up to 100 hours in a week if there's too much to do. So despite all the computers that we

34:25.360 --> 34:33.680
have, there seems to be more work. I think it's a combination of education and technology.

34:34.400 --> 34:40.720
From what I've seen in the history of science and in my own work, if you bring in more technology,

34:40.720 --> 34:46.000
if you have education that goes along with it, you're going to create more jobs. A great example

34:46.000 --> 34:54.000
of that is when we moved from horses to cars. At the time, blacksmiths were terribly opposed to the

34:54.000 --> 35:02.320
job loss that would result from removing horses as a form of transportation. On the other hand,

35:02.320 --> 35:09.040
once the cars came along, re-educating blacksmiths or educating other people to become

35:09.040 --> 35:16.400
designers, manufacturers, mechanics, just everything that's needed in that ecosystem

35:16.400 --> 35:23.520
created a tremendous amount of work. Make the same argument for accounting or any field where

35:23.520 --> 35:31.280
the computers have come in, not just machines. If you don't have retraining, if you don't have

35:31.280 --> 35:38.880
education, and ideally education in the broadest sense, which isn't limited skills, but the ability

35:38.880 --> 35:48.000
to learn and think, then you can have a problem. If you have a workforce that doesn't have the

35:48.000 --> 35:54.240
opportunity to learn and grow and move with the technology, there could be a lot of displacement.

35:54.240 --> 36:00.640
But if you do have rapid technological growth and you have governments that support and

36:00.640 --> 36:07.520
support the education that needs to happen along with that, and a workforce that's willing to

36:07.520 --> 36:15.840
relearn, I think historically you've seen an expansion in jobs as technology evolves.

36:17.040 --> 36:23.680
I also want to talk about the way that the United States is dealing with genetics in

36:23.680 --> 36:31.600
comparison to a country like China. China being apparently the biggest atheist country in the

36:31.600 --> 36:37.600
world, they have no problem experimenting with many different experimentations. The method CRISP,

36:37.600 --> 36:44.400
I think, the first experiments were done in China. They're saying the United States is going to be

36:44.400 --> 36:50.400
next, but another subject is designer babies. They're apparently very open-minded about it

36:50.400 --> 36:54.880
in China and Russia to experiment over it, but in the United States there are religious

36:58.000 --> 37:01.520
maybe judgments and obstacles along the way. How do you feel about that?

37:02.320 --> 37:10.800
Well, as I said before, the concept of Gattaca-style designer babies may seem like

37:10.800 --> 37:20.880
a good thing in the short run, but it leads to a loss of diversity that is genetically bad for

37:20.880 --> 37:27.440
a population, if not a species. But do you think United States in America, they have a kind of a

37:27.440 --> 37:32.080
limitation in front of them because of religion that Chinese and Russians don't have? Because

37:32.080 --> 37:37.600
they're going to do it anyways, whether bad or not, because it's kind of like a Cold War kind of

37:37.600 --> 37:46.240
an era. It's a competition that they're using military and they're using technology to gain

37:46.240 --> 37:50.480
the dominance of the leadership in the world. Do you think that United States is falling behind

37:50.480 --> 37:54.880
because of the religious approach that they have in politics, especially?

37:55.600 --> 38:02.720
I don't know. Here in the Northeast, we don't really see in Pennsylvania the effect of

38:02.720 --> 38:12.720
religious prescription against these sorts of scientific adventures or misadventures.

38:13.600 --> 38:19.360
There may be other types of regulations. The US can be pretty chaotic. Different communities,

38:19.360 --> 38:26.640
states or counties or cities will embark on their own social experiments. We have a lot of diversity.

38:26.640 --> 38:35.600
You may have less of that diversity in a more structured authoritarian country like in China

38:35.600 --> 38:45.360
or in Russia. The same thing is true in Canada. Canadians are fairly laid back and what happens

38:45.360 --> 38:50.080
in Toronto may be different from the cultural mores of Saskatchewan.

38:50.080 --> 38:54.240
Excellent. I'm just going to ask you the last question that I'm asking all the guests. If you

38:54.240 --> 38:59.280
come across an intelligent alien from a different civilization, what would you say as the worst thing

38:59.280 --> 39:02.880
humanity has done and what would you say as humanity's greatest achievement?

You should have sent me this question to think about for a month ahead. I'm taking it very

39:09.840 --> 39:16.880
seriously. Part of the point of the question is just to capture the reaction of the people

39:16.880 --> 39:22.800
hearing it for the first time too. I think the worst thing that humanity has done is

39:22.800 --> 39:38.160
depriving human beings as people of opportunities to become what they can. The most severe example

39:38.160 --> 39:47.840
that would be genocide, murder and war, but that can happen in other forms of repression, poverty

39:47.840 --> 39:56.240
and so on. I think in the ways in which society makes us either not exist or become less human,

39:57.520 --> 40:06.000
that's a terrible thing. To the extent that society can help people become more, do more

40:06.000 --> 40:13.200
and contribute more, that's a great thing. I think my answer to that would be a human answer

40:13.200 --> 40:20.800
as opposed to any other technology answer. To the extent that society can help humans become more

40:20.800 --> 40:28.160
human and people and having greater interrelationships, that's great. The degree to

40:28.160 --> 40:43.600
which people and their potentials are repressed, that's terrible.

40:58.160 --> 41:05.600
Thank you.
