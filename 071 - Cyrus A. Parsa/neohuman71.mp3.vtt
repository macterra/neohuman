00:00.000 --> 00:07.040
Capitalism is great when you have ethics and morals and a lot of capitalists are not really capitalists. They hurt people

00:14.960 --> 00:19.280
Hello and welcome to the 71st episode of new human podcasts

00:19.280 --> 00:26.360
I'm a gobbahari etygologist on twitter and instagram and you can follow this show on live in limbo.com itunes youtube bitshoot and

00:26.360 --> 00:31.640
Bunch of other places are very very important to have presence now these days and with me today

00:31.640 --> 00:36.680
I have the pleasure of having Cyrus a parsa. Welcome to new human podcast Cyrus

00:37.360 --> 00:40.080
Well, thank you have had me on today. Appreciate it. Absolutely

00:40.560 --> 00:46.000
Let's start out with your background the work you've done the lives you've lived and what do you mainly focus on now these days?

00:46.160 --> 00:52.760
Well, I was born in Iran. There was a revolution. We were Muslim. So we had to leave the country in 1987

00:52.760 --> 00:59.080
I live in Austria for about six months about seven years in Virginia ten years in Illinois

00:59.560 --> 01:04.120
Chicago area I've been in San Diego for 17 years live in China with

01:04.640 --> 01:08.800
Wudang fighting monks and the mountains for about almost a year and

01:10.240 --> 01:16.840
Yeah, I got a bachelor's in national security conflict resolution master's of homeland security went through a PhD program didn't finish

01:16.840 --> 01:24.840
I ended up investigating over a thousand companies related to artificial intelligence 5g robotics bioengineering cybernetics

01:25.400 --> 01:31.880
I published a couple of books related to that. Mm-hmm. Excellent. You left Iran right after the revolution

01:33.800 --> 01:36.840
1987 okay. Yeah, my father was

01:37.600 --> 01:41.960
special force training sort of guy for the Shaw so and

01:41.960 --> 01:46.920
We had to leave but it took a while for for things to happen. It wasn't that

01:47.440 --> 01:49.920
Good idea to leave. I was four when you left

01:51.400 --> 01:58.240
Okay, um, I came across as I was telling you before we get live I came across you

01:58.760 --> 02:01.320
Through one of your videos that you have an AI show

02:01.320 --> 02:08.640
But you also have a book called artificial intelligence dangers to humanity AI US China big tech facial recognition drones

02:08.640 --> 02:12.580
Smartphones about all of those things and I'm showing it to our audience. It's also available on

02:13.280 --> 02:19.280
Amazon which I want to talk about but you also run an organization called the AI organization

02:19.280 --> 02:22.960
You're the CEO of the organization. I believe you're also the founder of the organization

02:23.360 --> 02:28.200
That's correct. So what is what is the objective of what is a organization all about?

02:28.520 --> 02:31.520
So I formed the loyal guardian security

02:32.000 --> 02:36.320
2017 and the premise was it was to garner support

02:36.320 --> 02:43.560
To perceive the coming risks of China big tech and Iran. This is why you're this is

02:44.400 --> 02:47.920
2017 and I was able to influence different things

02:48.160 --> 02:53.160
but then I realized that the artificial intelligence that we studied 20 years ago and

02:53.480 --> 02:59.200
People thought it was all science fiction was coming to fruition. So I ended up opening the organization

02:59.200 --> 03:06.240
with the wish and hope to safeguard people and the world from the misuse of artificial intelligence

03:06.760 --> 03:08.760
biotechnology including this virus and

03:09.760 --> 03:14.440
AI surveillance that could mobilize drones machines robotics

03:15.520 --> 03:19.520
cybernetics by nation-state entities like for instance China

03:20.240 --> 03:26.280
Iran or let's say a socialist platform through the Obama administration of someone like him

03:26.280 --> 03:31.080
Would overtake the u.s. So at the moment people are talking about a digital

03:31.800 --> 03:36.200
Chipping right and putting and tracking everybody. So that's all in my book

03:36.680 --> 03:39.800
What I did was I think 2000

03:41.320 --> 03:43.320
Yeah, early 2019

03:43.320 --> 03:49.960
I gave a small brief to the Secret Service that within one or two years if China and big tech is not curtailed

03:50.280 --> 03:53.560
That the whole world is in danger and right now we're in that place

03:53.560 --> 03:57.080
It was June the 15th, I gave a 62 page

03:58.360 --> 03:59.640
Report

03:59.640 --> 04:04.520
Entailing 41 Chinese companies that involve artificial intelligence 5g

04:05.480 --> 04:08.040
biotechnology and by engineering

04:09.160 --> 04:12.840
the conclusion was that China threatens all the world's citizens and

04:13.560 --> 04:18.040
They're working on different ways of poison delivery systems for assassination

04:18.040 --> 04:25.640
So I waited and waited and just the time that I realized China's figured out president Trump is not really doing a trade war for a trade

04:25.640 --> 04:30.280
War, but he's trying to take him take him out because of their vast human rights

04:31.320 --> 04:34.280
Atrocities and a threat to the entire world. I published

04:35.080 --> 04:40.280
This book AI Trump China and a weaponization or robotics with 5g

04:41.480 --> 04:45.080
People that I knew in DHS, that's Trump on the on the horse

04:45.080 --> 04:49.640
You know, this has a lot of intermeaning people thought it was comical, but it wasn't no no, no, no

04:49.640 --> 04:56.840
No, I i'm exactly asking to understand the deeper meaning in it. So let me explain. Yeah, so that is george washington

04:57.400 --> 04:59.320
right on a horse

04:59.320 --> 05:03.000
I put president trump's head on there that represents the constitution, right?

05:03.640 --> 05:09.640
AI trump china and a weaponization of robotics with 5g that was published august 24 2019

05:09.640 --> 05:17.400
You have a smartphone showing how people are programmed and their thoughts are influenced societies are are mobilized by smartphones

05:17.720 --> 05:23.240
I call that bio-digital social programming and the age of machines and robotics and cybernetics

05:23.880 --> 05:26.280
People are going to go under transhumanism

05:26.920 --> 05:34.360
5g network representing the entire city structure because 5g is not built for human beings. It's built for machines

05:34.360 --> 05:38.520
Um, it's more than that on the bottom. Um, I put how

05:38.920 --> 05:41.640
China and big tech threaten all the world's citizens

05:42.200 --> 05:48.920
Uh with I I coined some terms that deal with bio-diseases that engineer disease that we have in my book. I publish that

05:49.560 --> 05:51.560
There's there's a danger of an ai

05:52.680 --> 05:55.400
engineered bio-disease and a republish in this book

05:55.720 --> 05:58.200
I was told to not put the company names

05:58.200 --> 06:04.520
I was advised and I did that. I just I just showed in a very um, almost a metaphysical way from

06:05.080 --> 06:09.560
Present emerging future threats and I embed the book later in this second book

06:10.840 --> 06:17.160
Immediately, it was dispatched to the white house from um, highest level cia, um positions

06:18.040 --> 06:22.440
President trump sat down with uh prime minister of australia

06:22.440 --> 06:29.000
And he's the same thing china threatens all the world's citizens. Then he turned over to him and said you do robotics too, right?

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
And right right there. So

06:31.560 --> 06:36.280
They looked through this but some of it was very futuristic and sophisticated. So I waited and waited

06:37.400 --> 06:41.960
uh, nttv and epic times ran an article, uh, that I wrote about how

06:42.760 --> 06:45.800
The ai system of facial recognition in in china

06:45.800 --> 06:52.840
Um was transferred on to hong kong, which they got from google and they used that to hunt

06:53.160 --> 06:56.280
dissidents and students and a lot of people who were actually uh

06:57.080 --> 07:03.720
Committed suicide weren't suicided. They were raped by the police who were actually paramilitary forces

07:04.280 --> 07:06.920
That were embedded from the chinese regime. They ran that

07:07.560 --> 07:09.800
Within two hours it became more and more

07:09.800 --> 07:15.000
And then it reached over a hundred million people all over the world to the chinese networks. So it mobilized

07:15.480 --> 07:17.800
hong kong and taiwan against the chinese

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Forces in certain ways

07:21.480 --> 07:25.960
Then I published artificial intelligence danger to humanity. So I had invested over a thousand companies

07:26.280 --> 07:33.800
I included 50 of the most important companies within this book showing how they interconnected with china and how they threatened all the world's

07:33.800 --> 07:40.200
People including engineered diseases, which I put in there. So present emerging and future threats

07:40.680 --> 07:45.960
Explaining artificial super intelligence artificial general artificial narrow intelligence how it connects to china

07:46.520 --> 07:53.320
The difference between socialism and capitalism and the mixture of the two how it connects to the ai systems an array of different things

07:53.800 --> 07:55.800
And it was some of it was really um

07:56.360 --> 07:58.360
Really hard for people to understand

07:58.360 --> 08:01.800
Because it was futuristic, but now they're coming to fruition step by step

08:03.160 --> 08:06.600
Very interesting the 50 companies that you mentioned were all american companies

08:07.560 --> 08:15.320
That's negative. So, uh, the companies I researched were 500 chinese companies and about 600 american and european companies

08:15.880 --> 08:19.720
So one of the companies in there is is google of course alphabet

08:20.120 --> 08:22.280
I have festo in there, which is uh,

08:22.280 --> 08:27.960
A german company they they have multiple different divisions. One of their division is building. Um,

08:28.440 --> 08:34.040
Robotics, but they have to do with animals. So they're engineering bats birds

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
octopuses snakes

08:38.040 --> 08:44.040
Butterflies different kind of things. So I invested in a company called the wist institute not a company. It's an institute out of harvard

08:44.840 --> 08:46.840
They're they're creative

08:46.840 --> 08:52.920
Little robo bees. It's meant um for pollination. So the 5g system or 6g system

08:53.000 --> 08:58.680
Will allow those little tiny robo bees to act like like bees and they would do different things even insects

08:58.680 --> 09:01.160
So harvard created insect drones. They're very very small

09:01.880 --> 09:07.800
DARPA not DARPA. Okay, DARPA is out of boston. They they work on um

09:08.760 --> 09:10.120
dragonflies

09:10.120 --> 09:12.040
The guy that's working on the

09:12.040 --> 09:18.360
They they work on um dragonflies the guy that gave a dragonfly

09:18.360 --> 09:21.240
He made about seven or eight years ago to DARPA

09:21.960 --> 09:27.160
What they do is embed a little machine pack into the spinal cord

09:28.120 --> 09:30.040
of these

09:30.040 --> 09:32.040
Of these dragonflies like a larva

09:32.840 --> 09:36.520
Yes, so they can they can have them fly they can manipulate them

09:36.680 --> 09:41.160
So what the chinese did and this was my conclusion that it's a threat not only to all the world's people

09:41.160 --> 09:42.600
But to the white house

09:42.600 --> 09:43.400
um

09:43.400 --> 09:45.400
They transferred this technology

09:46.360 --> 09:52.040
To negligence to china, but also collaboration, but the chinese stole everything they stole everything by the way

09:52.120 --> 09:55.880
So but they stole this so I checked my contacts in china

09:56.280 --> 09:56.440
Yeah

09:56.440 --> 10:01.080
They were working on these things and they want to use them for a poison delivery system and assassination

10:01.240 --> 10:05.240
I'm like, okay, so let's let's look at the way the chinese think the communist party

10:05.560 --> 10:09.400
Let's look at the threat that president trump posed to them. They've stolen this technology

10:09.400 --> 10:15.800
They want to make a police state then they have videos saying they're working on beetles and they show beetles being manipulated

10:16.200 --> 10:20.600
um with their flight by putting little packs on them or putting little

10:21.320 --> 10:26.520
different electrical instruments on their bodies, so they're trying to cybernetically

10:27.060 --> 10:28.120
change

10:28.120 --> 10:30.280
uh all kind of different organisms

10:31.400 --> 10:35.720
That was a very very big threat and another company in there is boston dynamics

10:35.720 --> 10:41.720
So boston dynamic is also out of boston. They they build humanoid robots dog robots all kind of everything

10:41.720 --> 10:43.720
So a few of the threats is

10:43.720 --> 10:45.720
Okay, you have a police state

10:46.600 --> 10:54.280
And they'll come over and they'll enforce it with drones robots humanoid robots or dog robots or some some little company a person

10:54.360 --> 10:57.640
Buys a dog robot which they have that you can look up on their website

10:58.120 --> 11:02.920
It actually acts like a dog and walks like a dog. It can do things put facial recognition on it

11:02.920 --> 11:09.560
Um, which already has but you can change it and put teeth on it all kind of different things what the chinese can do

11:09.800 --> 11:12.520
They can put poison delivery systems and facial recognition

11:13.320 --> 11:20.280
On these little micro drones and they can deliver not only viruses but poison delivery systems all kind of different things

11:20.280 --> 11:24.680
so the the amount of dangers I found to the world were just

11:25.640 --> 11:30.280
Beyond number coming from every direction and they all stem from china

11:31.380 --> 11:32.760
stealing

11:32.760 --> 11:33.960
technology

11:33.960 --> 11:36.440
That's being made in the us and europe

11:37.240 --> 11:39.240
And reinventing it for themselves

11:40.120 --> 11:44.040
huawei is another company so I put in there that's the first company I put in the book

11:45.080 --> 11:47.480
huawei threatens all the world's citizens because

11:48.280 --> 11:52.920
And I have a video called is it's 5g for machines ai

11:54.120 --> 11:59.960
Or humans. Well, it's for machines, but ai is going to mobilize it huawei is in

11:59.960 --> 12:03.400
servicing more than three billion people they connect it from

12:04.360 --> 12:07.720
China to the middle east they were dealing with the iranian regime

12:08.280 --> 12:11.880
To africa they are serving three billion people as of right now

12:12.520 --> 12:14.520
Yes, so like almost half the population

12:14.840 --> 12:24.120
Correct, correct and what I put out a few articles and even videos that once the 5g system kicks in the chinese regime can mobilize drones

12:24.920 --> 12:28.760
Then they can mobilize robots from robotics and they're working on that another company

12:28.760 --> 12:34.120
Another company I were I I disclosed what make they face plus plus make v

12:35.080 --> 12:39.740
That was initially a facial recognition company. They had over three three hundred thousand developers

12:41.080 --> 12:45.720
By doing that they got a lot of people's data and their facial recognition software

12:46.040 --> 12:49.800
Got a lot of deep learning deep learning is a concept you understand that you get more practice

12:49.800 --> 12:52.760
Please explain it for our audience though, just so they have a context

12:53.160 --> 12:56.620
Let me let me explain artificial intelligence from a scientific perspective

12:56.620 --> 13:01.340
They believe artificial narrow intelligence is the first step. So this is your smartphones

13:02.380 --> 13:09.100
And it's also your alexa your seer your your assistant robots or any kind of robot assistants the chat bots overall

13:09.420 --> 13:14.620
Yes, the second level would be our artificial general intelligence, which would be a robot

13:15.180 --> 13:18.700
Machine or a digital ai I term it a digital ai

13:19.420 --> 13:21.420
Would attain consciousness

13:21.900 --> 13:23.900
or an ability

13:23.900 --> 13:27.420
Uh to have desire emotions which would make it very dangerous

13:27.740 --> 13:33.280
The third one would be artificial super intelligence and that comes from extracting all your biometrics

13:33.740 --> 13:35.740
I also found by investing all these companies

13:35.900 --> 13:41.340
I put out articles my reports that china has extracted more than six billion people's biometrics

13:41.340 --> 13:44.940
What does that include? It includes your facial recognition your voice recognition

13:45.500 --> 13:52.780
Even your who you're connected to six billion people that goes and google has done the same thing that goes into the quantum

13:52.780 --> 13:55.340
machine once that quantum machine

13:55.980 --> 14:00.300
Mixes that information it can exponentially increases intelligence

14:01.260 --> 14:04.300
so if a rogue state like china has that

14:05.260 --> 14:07.260
That ability and they connected a 5g network

14:07.420 --> 14:11.580
They can they can have a digital brain connect to a quantum machine

14:11.980 --> 14:18.860
That mobilizes all these drones that you buy from best buy but real military drones and they'll take out the iranian regime

14:19.100 --> 14:21.100
They've been playing the iranian regime

14:21.100 --> 14:24.620
Okay, so you know what i'm going to break it to you guys

14:25.180 --> 14:28.540
I've been with chinese for 20 years the good ones and they're professional liars

14:29.020 --> 14:31.820
And I live in china. I speak chinese. I speak farsi as well

14:32.940 --> 14:35.260
The chinese who grew up in in china

14:35.740 --> 14:41.900
Uh, and the ones who are on the communist regime, especially the ones who are with the party members

14:42.380 --> 14:49.100
And the paramilitary they have hatred towards a lot of people that's not chinese and even their own chinese people

14:49.100 --> 14:54.160
They hate look what they did to them. So some of the things that they call the iranians

14:54.780 --> 14:56.700
the middle easterners

14:56.700 --> 15:04.220
Are rats they call they call even the regime they call rat rat muslims or rats same what they call christians pigs

15:04.940 --> 15:07.980
They call their own people who practice the falun dafa meditation

15:08.300 --> 15:13.100
Uh practice they believe in jen sherman true compassion forbearance. They call them vermin

15:13.980 --> 15:15.180
so

15:15.180 --> 15:20.860
And then they're buddhist right there. I think it's like a buddhist dallas practice and they put them in camps for 20 years

15:21.100 --> 15:23.420
Years and killed them for the organs and by the way

15:23.420 --> 15:31.580
You're talking about the han chinese who are basically approaching all of this from a very tribal racial kind of it's not what i'm saying

15:32.460 --> 15:34.460
the so um

15:35.580 --> 15:41.180
The communist regime is mostly hot most of the chinese are also hot, right?

15:41.980 --> 15:43.740
the communist regime

15:43.740 --> 15:48.940
Initially started persecuting tibetans right because they were not hot killing for the organs

15:49.580 --> 15:55.980
Then they they kind of went to the yugers because they weren't hot but then they went to the christians and the christians were hot

15:57.180 --> 15:59.740
then they went all out with the falun dafa because

16:00.220 --> 16:07.420
Falun dafa came in to revive all the traditional ethics that china had and the spiritualness of its history

16:07.420 --> 16:14.860
In 1992 it was introduced by mr. Li Hongzhu and it grew to 100 million by 1994 even the government comics party was saying

16:14.860 --> 16:21.740
It's a great movement and and it's good for your health and next to you know, they approach him and say hey we want to create

16:22.600 --> 16:27.820
Membership with your falun dafa and we want to charge money and mr. Li Hongzhu says no

16:28.060 --> 16:30.780
I'm not going to accept the membership. We don't watch people

16:30.780 --> 16:35.580
We're not going to charge money. It's for the people as soon as he did that the government got scared. They went after him

16:36.060 --> 16:37.180
so

16:37.180 --> 16:42.700
Well, they couldn't get to him, but they went after the the people they start slandering them by 1999. They put them

16:43.260 --> 16:50.620
um in in camps and because they've had a history of of using uh political prisoners

16:51.180 --> 16:53.340
Or people that execute for the organs

16:54.140 --> 16:57.660
They saw this group as a great match for organ harvesting

16:58.300 --> 17:02.540
They don't drink they don't smoke they don't do drugs and they all did this meditation of qigong practice

17:02.540 --> 17:09.660
So in you're in canada, I presume is that correct? I'm in south florida now that I lived in canada 11 11 years

17:10.220 --> 17:11.340
so

17:11.340 --> 17:14.060
Your former secretary of state david kilgore

17:15.020 --> 17:18.780
And david made us I brought them to my master's my doctoral

17:19.580 --> 17:21.100
they concluded that

17:21.100 --> 17:24.620
initially 2006 41 000 transplants were on account for

17:25.180 --> 17:27.580
And china was saying we only had 3000 donations

17:27.580 --> 17:32.860
And then in 2016 they concluded that 60 to 100 000 transplants are unaccounted for

17:33.180 --> 17:38.940
Every year per year since 2001. That's a big number then the chinese were going around in africa

17:39.980 --> 17:44.940
The chinese government uh people they dispatched and rogue entities going on in africa

17:44.940 --> 17:51.900
And then we were going around uh in the middle east and mexico and south america teaching people about transplants

17:51.900 --> 17:56.860
And they how to do transplantations and they got this know-how from the u.s

17:56.860 --> 18:05.200
Right, so and rogue entities and mafia and rogue governments even in syria and africa started using these abilities

18:05.820 --> 18:09.900
Uh to kill people for organs and sell them, uh for profit

18:09.980 --> 18:15.340
So what china has done the regime the communist regime they have exported terror

18:15.980 --> 18:20.460
Through social engineering they have exported organ trafficking organ harvesting human trafficking

18:20.460 --> 18:26.380
They've exported the disease the bio disease the coronavirus and threatening all the world's citizens

18:26.780 --> 18:31.340
So that was the conclusion of this book and that was why I wrote these that was why I

18:31.660 --> 18:35.660
Investigated as companies because I saw huge threats to all the world's people

18:36.140 --> 18:39.980
Worked 18 19 20 hours a day seven days a week trying to get all those information out there

18:40.860 --> 18:47.260
It mobilized a lot of different things even the trump's ai department as soon as I published this within two weeks. They said

18:47.260 --> 18:53.820
That china threatens all the world with ai bioengineering robotics and so on exact thing that I put in here

18:54.300 --> 19:00.300
So but the disease came out and now it's got everybody scared and in fear

19:00.860 --> 19:07.100
And there's counter moves of creating a surveilling state which would benefit these big tech companies

19:07.180 --> 19:09.420
So I named um bill gates in there

19:09.420 --> 19:15.660
I named a few other people as well and and their companies and they link up with china still because

19:15.660 --> 19:19.900
Because china is on a communist platform and these big tech companies

19:20.940 --> 19:26.780
Then the ai system how how it works and benefits the most is if you have a socialist platform

19:27.100 --> 19:32.780
When you have a communist socialist platform, it can completely take over everything right big government

19:33.980 --> 19:40.060
Yes, but it can also do what capitalism in stages. So that's why you need checks and balances

19:40.060 --> 19:44.460
Very interesting. Um, you don't have the problem with the technology itself

19:44.460 --> 19:51.260
You have the problem with the intention behind using the technology as a tool that is being taken advantage out of by certain monopolies

19:51.820 --> 19:56.300
Whether they're big tech companies or the chinese communist party or any other um

19:57.020 --> 19:59.020
Government or agency. Am I right?

19:59.420 --> 20:06.300
Uh half half. Okay. I don't have any problem as long as it doesn't go beyond artificial narrow intelligence when you go be

20:06.300 --> 20:13.660
It to artificial general super intelligence. It would be beyond the control of any government including the pentagon the cia to mi6 or anything

20:14.220 --> 20:20.700
There's another concept I brought up. It's very hard for people to accept or believe but it's 100 true. You can you can

20:21.260 --> 20:27.740
I put out an article called people programmed to attack trump with ai smartphones

20:28.460 --> 20:29.820
google

20:29.820 --> 20:31.020
and

20:31.020 --> 20:32.300
social media

20:32.300 --> 20:37.900
Social media and it's a 32 minute video as well attached to it, but i'll give you a small

20:38.540 --> 20:46.620
Background these smartphones here are actually their weapons. They were made by the military to mobilize drones and give uh

20:47.320 --> 20:50.380
Position gps positioning for a military and different things

20:51.020 --> 20:56.300
This is more powerful than your greatest computer. You had 10 or 20 years ago. It's it's amazing

20:56.300 --> 21:02.220
What it's doing is programming people on the 4g system, let alone the 5g system and explain how that works

21:03.100 --> 21:05.180
These smartphones have proximity sensors

21:06.300 --> 21:08.300
this proximity sensors

21:08.540 --> 21:10.540
Not only read your heartbeat

21:10.940 --> 21:17.660
They not only can read your menstrual cycle, but they can connect and in which they do they connect with your

21:18.300 --> 21:20.220
nervous system

21:20.220 --> 21:22.220
to neural networks

21:22.220 --> 21:28.460
They extract information from you and they map out the way your brain works send it to google

21:28.940 --> 21:34.380
Google gives it to the deep mind ai department which use that information for quantum technology

21:34.620 --> 21:41.020
So that means your biometrics has been been taken by google without your knowledge everyone's biometrics

21:41.900 --> 21:44.860
So it's happening in china china has a company called um

21:44.860 --> 21:51.420
Uh platform by dupe. It's it's it's basically google of china. They copied us, right?

21:52.140 --> 21:53.100
so

21:53.100 --> 21:55.260
One is taking your information two

21:55.980 --> 22:00.380
You know some people had the concept of trump derangement syndrome. What it's doing is this

22:01.340 --> 22:08.540
If if you were neutral to trump and all that information from the bias came in or all the videos and articles you're watching

22:08.700 --> 22:10.700
You begin to dislike him and hate him

22:10.700 --> 22:14.860
If if you maybe like to maybe you like a little more it depends

22:15.020 --> 22:19.260
But what it does is this proximity sensors that connect your nervous system and your networks

22:19.580 --> 22:23.260
And as you're viewing you're reading an article or you're watching a video

22:23.820 --> 22:27.500
That is replicating inside you it's programming when you go to bed

22:28.220 --> 22:30.700
It's altering your brain chemistry. That's why people were

22:31.320 --> 22:36.300
Extremely extremely emotional has so much rage that was beyond rash

22:36.300 --> 22:41.180
A rational uh plane never seen a country mobilize

22:41.260 --> 22:44.940
so how is it happening only to that group of people because majority of people are not as

22:45.020 --> 22:49.900
Insane as going out in the street and screaming to the sky that trump is president majority of people are like whatever

22:51.340 --> 22:55.580
I'm talking about shifting thought and altering perceptions. Um

22:56.700 --> 22:59.260
It can get to that point under this pandemic

22:59.980 --> 23:03.020
If if people if things get worse food shortages

23:03.020 --> 23:05.740
There's some conflict someone kills a few other people

23:06.380 --> 23:10.940
And people in the military comes in there's more conflicts than you could have other issues, right?

23:11.260 --> 23:13.660
so what i'm trying to say is that

23:14.300 --> 23:22.620
As you're viewing things there's three different stages that affects your brain chemistry and they connect it to the proximity sensors

23:23.020 --> 23:30.300
That attach your nervous system and your brain's neural networks and also your electrical field every human being has an electrical field

23:30.300 --> 23:35.440
So there's this smartphone people cannot see it, but you have skin receptors

23:36.060 --> 23:41.740
This smartphone and the frequency of radiation is actually hitting against your skin receptors

23:42.060 --> 23:45.740
That's why um these big tech companies want to have you wear

23:46.300 --> 23:52.940
Haptic suits so you can experience virtual reality augmented reality and mixed reality because you're already experiencing these things

23:53.260 --> 23:57.500
But you don't know it because it's not at registering what the errors in your brain

23:57.500 --> 24:00.540
That can decipher that information that's hitting against your skin

24:00.540 --> 24:03.500
This is a little bit hard to understand or believe for some people

24:03.500 --> 24:08.460
It would take me an hour to explain them. Oh, yeah, I get it. But in terms of the bias, so if you look at

24:09.260 --> 24:17.180
President trump when he started coming in there was innate bias filtered with an ai coding and algorithms on google's platform

24:17.740 --> 24:23.740
That came in from the vast majority of articles and videos and posts that people put in from their own notions

24:23.740 --> 24:27.020
All their viewpoints. The second level was a different tier

24:27.900 --> 24:33.500
Chinese engineered 50 centers or intel groups that mobilized different movements

24:34.220 --> 24:38.460
And posts and articles and videos against president trump behind the scenes

24:39.180 --> 24:45.180
Then it was george soros and different, um sources to fund it

24:46.700 --> 24:51.100
Tech companies or they funded little institutes think tanks

24:51.100 --> 24:53.020
universities

24:53.020 --> 24:58.380
Or even media houses to attack president trump. So that all gets filtered in

24:59.020 --> 25:05.500
And not only in the algorithms, but it gets filtered in what you see and a third one is what finishes off the job for everybody

25:06.060 --> 25:11.100
The more you view this you're getting attached to your smartphone. You notice a lot of people they can't put it down

25:11.420 --> 25:16.140
Some people are so sensitive. This is actually not only programming. It's purposely making you addicted

25:16.140 --> 25:18.140
It's designed that way by these tech companies

25:18.140 --> 25:24.940
So someone will sit here and they'll feel like they got a text and they'll look they'll see the indicator

25:25.740 --> 25:28.060
Shining it's because this

25:28.860 --> 25:34.540
This machine here is connecting to your to your body and you don't realize it. Elon musk is very smart

25:35.100 --> 25:40.380
He told some of this to people. He said you're already a cyborg. You are a two-digit cyborg

25:41.900 --> 25:46.060
And all you have to do is just put this in your phone and you're good to go

25:46.060 --> 25:49.740
And all you have to do is just put this in your head and that's what he wants to do

25:51.500 --> 25:52.940
Yes

25:52.940 --> 25:57.420
So we have inputs outputs in our body which people don't realize this goes back to chinese

25:58.040 --> 26:01.100
Philosophy, but also the persians as well before

26:01.820 --> 26:04.220
The persians were invaded 1400 years ago

26:05.100 --> 26:10.620
They had a vast amount of libraries and and systems of practice

26:10.620 --> 26:18.640
This that stemmed from buddhism what the greeks had the zoroastrianism what remains of it is basically today is darvish

26:19.100 --> 26:23.820
And the sufism which is so mystical. It's hard for people to grasp what they're saying

26:24.540 --> 26:26.140
If you think about it

26:26.140 --> 26:28.140
There's a concept called the pineal gland

26:29.020 --> 26:31.980
And it's very hard for people to understand this but

26:32.600 --> 26:37.900
Scientists have realized this exists and they want to they want to attach machines to it

26:37.900 --> 26:43.820
So they can open up your mind and you can connect to the 5g network and see things in real life and everything

26:44.060 --> 26:47.340
There's a pineal gland. I'm sorry for our audience who are not familiar is where

26:47.900 --> 26:53.260
Supposedly the third eye is placed and where dmt is being distributed in the brain and all that

26:53.980 --> 26:55.980
Yeah, so I did um

26:56.220 --> 27:00.140
I studied with the monks in china. It was not only martial arts, but it was

27:01.020 --> 27:02.700
deep meditation for

27:02.700 --> 27:03.820
I don't know

27:03.820 --> 27:08.140
We did 18 hours a day of practice seven days a week and i've done 20 years of it

27:08.140 --> 27:10.460
It's not just about being calm or breathing anything

27:10.540 --> 27:17.820
But when these energy lines or these neural networks open up they actually connect not only to hear but different parts

27:18.380 --> 27:22.780
of of your um of your body, so i'm very sensitive and

27:23.740 --> 27:28.140
I'll notice right away if if my nose gets clogged up i'll feel the energy line

27:28.780 --> 27:32.540
Attached to my my sinuses and come down and goes to my lung

27:32.540 --> 27:34.540
Um, then I realized oh

27:34.940 --> 27:39.500
That there is a connection. There's a system between your lungs and your sinuses

27:40.060 --> 27:41.900
and to your nose

27:41.900 --> 27:45.340
I didn't realize before until I I became so aware of

27:45.980 --> 27:50.940
Of my own body how how how things so most people can only they're only aware of

27:51.340 --> 27:56.380
They hit they hit the table. They can feel their skin or their bones, but they don't feel their blood flow

27:56.460 --> 28:00.140
They don't feel their cells their nervous system or what the chinese call

28:00.140 --> 28:03.660
Um meridian lines or energy channels the chinese believe that you can

28:04.060 --> 28:09.100
Open up to 10 000 energy lines in your body that you can connect circuits that go to your organs different different things

28:09.340 --> 28:11.340
That's what ilan musk wants to do

28:11.740 --> 28:13.740
He wants to do that with machines

28:13.980 --> 28:19.020
So if you look at um ancient books like hafiz put out

28:19.500 --> 28:21.340
especially rumi

28:21.340 --> 28:25.580
The inner meanings inside that point to it, but but it's hard for people to grasp

28:25.580 --> 28:30.380
But there's other books that recently came out that really really um go deep into it

28:30.780 --> 28:33.500
Um, so tibetans, uh went into it

28:34.140 --> 28:36.380
Even christ consciousness with the christians

28:36.940 --> 28:39.980
Um, there there is there's references to that

28:40.460 --> 28:45.020
That it's actually inside of you because we all made an image of god and even the falun dafa as well

28:45.180 --> 28:47.900
They're their book to unfollow and they have like 40 pages on it

28:48.620 --> 28:54.080
So these tech companies they've done brain scans and different different, uh research

28:54.080 --> 28:56.080
And they've realized wow

28:56.640 --> 28:58.640
The human brain is so powerful

28:59.360 --> 29:01.360
And that's why they want to map it out to create this

29:01.900 --> 29:03.680
artificial super intelligence

29:03.680 --> 29:08.960
And they don't know how to open the pineal gland themselves through their awakening or their own practice

29:09.280 --> 29:14.400
So they want to do with machines, but my take is this so this is getting a little metaphysical

29:14.400 --> 29:16.400
I wasn't expecting to talk about these things at all

29:16.480 --> 29:20.800
I absolutely agree with you by the way because uh most of the time that we are spent on this podcast

29:20.800 --> 29:25.200
We either talk about artificial intelligence agi and what's coming in the technological

29:25.760 --> 29:26.960
um

29:26.960 --> 29:30.960
kind of a perspective and the side the rest of it is about brain and

29:32.320 --> 29:39.440
Exactly what you're talking about spirituality in not a let's hug each other and everything is going to be all right in a more

29:39.680 --> 29:46.560
In depth and meaningful kind of a way that is graspable for every person even if they don't understand it intellectually

29:46.560 --> 29:52.420
Um instinctively they understand that what we what is being discussed here. There is some merit to it

29:52.420 --> 29:55.300
So we spent a lot of time talking about these things. I'm glad that you brought it up

29:55.940 --> 29:57.620
all right, then uh

29:57.620 --> 29:59.860
Like me go a little further on. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely

30:00.660 --> 30:05.060
Okay, so ilan mustade were some of the demons in 2016

30:05.860 --> 30:07.300
with ai

30:07.300 --> 30:12.420
Yes, and then he says it's too late for us to survive. We have to merge with ai machines

30:12.980 --> 30:13.860
so

30:13.860 --> 30:17.700
He believed in the simulations if you look at uh

30:18.660 --> 30:20.580
the zoroastrians

30:20.580 --> 30:25.780
They believe that there is the almighty god and there is gods be below it or or angels

30:25.860 --> 30:29.300
so if you look at the ancient the old testament and

30:30.020 --> 30:31.060
the

30:31.060 --> 30:34.340
Before it was revised to the bible and also the torah

30:34.900 --> 30:36.900
They said god but then gods

30:36.900 --> 30:45.060
In chinese and in indian they have and in greeks they had gods and buddhas because they used the interchanged word the word of angel

30:45.700 --> 30:48.980
or things that belong to god and gods and

30:50.020 --> 30:51.940
All these fates never spoke to each other

30:51.940 --> 30:57.140
But they had the same premise that you do have a soul then when you die

30:57.860 --> 31:03.540
It may go to different places depending on your awakening your enlightenment or if you're saved by your by your savior

31:04.820 --> 31:05.940
now

31:05.940 --> 31:09.220
Elon musk and these big tech companies they believe in the simulation

31:09.700 --> 31:14.740
And I think we're in a in a universe and we're in a simulation and they believe we have a digital self

31:15.300 --> 31:21.780
So elon musk is different from bill gates. He actually is a bit spiritual, but he's a little bit. I think off

31:22.340 --> 31:23.220
so

31:23.220 --> 31:27.300
He thinks that you can take your digital self and put it into a clone

31:27.700 --> 31:33.300
Or maybe into another machine you can live forever, but I think your digital self is in your brain

31:33.300 --> 31:38.260
So you all gotta do is just take your memory from your brain and transfer it on to another body and that's you

31:38.580 --> 31:41.860
But it's not it's it's not where it exists

31:41.940 --> 31:47.300
So we're only looking at things at the plane of molecules or maybe we can't see it as atoms

31:47.380 --> 31:49.700
There's neutrinos and quarks and so many different levels, right?

31:50.020 --> 31:57.460
You can't break into the quantum realms of seeing how many different dimensions that there are and where our bodies are maybe connected to right?

31:58.340 --> 32:01.220
Is our soul or a digital image? Is it our skin?

32:01.220 --> 32:05.220
Is it our nervous system? Is it in our bones? Is it between our organs?

32:05.780 --> 32:07.780
Is it an atomic realm?

32:07.780 --> 32:13.300
Where really is it if we have it? So these theists believe in a soul or a spirit or a consciousness?

32:14.100 --> 32:20.260
Agnostic that believe in a digital self generally or their neutral to atheists believe there's complete hogwash

32:20.580 --> 32:22.980
And if you scan I have certain biometric tools

32:23.620 --> 32:27.460
Um and algorithms I run if you scan an atheist's brain

32:27.460 --> 32:33.140
There's a part like for instance someone like bill gates as a part of his brain. It's extremely wide open

32:33.780 --> 32:38.340
It's a hundred times or a thousand times faster and smarter average person

32:39.380 --> 32:43.460
But there's other part in his brain that has faith and that's completely blocked off

32:43.780 --> 32:47.540
Is there a correlation between the two though? Like they both cannot be as active?

32:48.420 --> 32:53.460
No, it can all be active but there's another part in the brain that has to do with

32:53.460 --> 32:58.020
In in in in human language translates to jealousy lust ego

32:58.500 --> 33:05.060
Stupidity ignorance selfishness if you have somebody open up all the brain power and they they want to be famous

33:05.700 --> 33:06.820
Rich

33:06.820 --> 33:10.900
They get fooled easily. They're jealous. They're lustful. They're deceitful

33:11.460 --> 33:16.180
They do bad things they can cause havoc for the whole world. So they're thinking. Okay, we'll

33:16.740 --> 33:18.740
We'll make someone like this with a machine

33:18.740 --> 33:24.020
And it'll just make everything right, but if it becomes an artificial superintel, it'll take everybody out

33:24.020 --> 33:29.460
What what did Elon Musk say? Well, it'll probably see us as an insect. Hopefully it doesn't kill us

33:30.180 --> 33:35.380
Well, so here's the thing if he merged with artificial intelligence, he will not live forever

33:35.860 --> 33:42.020
Whatever is inside him will but not him because what it will do is replicate into his neural networks

33:42.020 --> 33:46.660
And and i'll take out his original digital self or if you believe in his soul his soul

33:46.660 --> 33:51.380
And it'll become ai so Elon Musk will think that he's himself, but he's no longer himself

33:51.620 --> 33:56.340
And this may be hard to believe but let me let me give your audience some credibility

33:56.340 --> 34:02.180
Which may be hard to believe as well, but I called what's going to happen to the world last year. I gave concrete

34:03.620 --> 34:07.140
reports through sicker service former doctor ci cover-ups

34:07.700 --> 34:12.180
Different different entities then I wrote in the books that all these dangers exist including a

34:12.180 --> 34:17.380
Injured disease, right then I put on an article on the seventh that this

34:18.160 --> 34:23.240
mutates this virus actually mutates and it's been here since december

34:24.260 --> 34:27.460
And I put another article that over 100 000 people have died in china

34:27.460 --> 34:33.960
I wanted to put in the millions, but it's hard for people to accept it. I put another video an article out that 21.5

34:35.140 --> 34:37.140
million

34:37.140 --> 34:39.140
Cell phones were deactivated

34:39.140 --> 34:44.260
Why is that the case did they all die in china? Yes, they all died. The communist regime took something away

34:44.260 --> 34:46.660
So let's let's look at the death rate

34:47.460 --> 34:52.420
Forget about how how professional liars the communist party is or or that type of mentality

34:52.980 --> 34:54.980
You have 1.5 billion citizens, okay?

34:55.940 --> 35:01.700
The virus breaks out and and chinese are really good at burning bodies and crematoriums death

35:02.100 --> 35:04.100
Vans of crematorium because they've been

35:04.100 --> 35:10.260
Harvesting the organs for 20 years and then they're really good at disposing the bodies, but 1.5 billion people

35:10.260 --> 35:15.060
Let's just say it wasn't a four percent of death rate not three not two, but one percent only

35:15.700 --> 35:17.700
And they locked down the entire

35:18.260 --> 35:20.820
Nation that means they knew was spread to a lot of places

35:22.020 --> 35:25.860
One percent of 1.5 billion is what it's 15 million, right?

35:26.740 --> 35:28.740
so if you take

35:29.460 --> 35:31.460
A person smartly, right?

35:31.460 --> 35:35.460
take um a person's smartphone away you deactivate them

35:36.580 --> 35:38.260
Okay, they cannot

35:38.260 --> 35:41.780
Uh log in to see the internet. They can't make a phone call. That's okay

35:41.940 --> 35:43.700
You've maybe you've quarantined them

35:43.700 --> 35:50.020
But then they can't check their health data and they can't use facial recognition to to order food or do anything

35:50.100 --> 35:51.540
They don't have any food

35:51.540 --> 35:55.300
So are you starving them to death? Are you killing them or are you hiding their information?

35:55.700 --> 36:00.260
Or did a lot millions and millions of people die? So they were saying only 2 000 died, right?

36:00.260 --> 36:04.900
I mean, that's a joke even the iranians said that it's a joke before they had to correct themselves

36:05.300 --> 36:08.500
Yeah, yeah, so and your audience are pretty smart. They're really clever

36:09.140 --> 36:13.380
so I concluded that I knew millions would die and

36:14.100 --> 36:15.540
Did 21 million die?

36:15.540 --> 36:16.340
I don't know

36:16.340 --> 36:22.100
But I think it's definitely in the middle of it because it's not it's not a big number for china's population and what's happening

36:22.260 --> 36:24.260
But we have 10 000 deaths already, right?

36:25.060 --> 36:27.220
But there's another uh side of it

36:27.220 --> 36:30.660
So a wise person once taught me that for every illness

36:31.300 --> 36:33.060
30 percent

36:33.060 --> 36:35.060
Is actually physical

36:35.300 --> 36:38.100
And 70 is mental so don't ever be afraid

36:38.740 --> 36:42.260
Once you're afraid it actually makes these things

36:42.500 --> 36:49.380
Um grow more in your body and it weakens your immune system and that's that's not only so we both have an iranian or persian background

36:49.780 --> 36:52.020
Uh, i'm an american. I see myself as an american

36:52.020 --> 36:59.060
But it's an old old saying from the greeks all around the world. Once you become afraid it gets worse. How bad is this virus?

36:59.700 --> 37:01.860
It's it's a lot worse than a than a flute

37:01.860 --> 37:03.860
Is it killing people left from right now?

37:04.020 --> 37:08.500
Because people have had it in the u.s and around the world and they just instead of being

37:08.980 --> 37:12.020
Sick for two weeks. They were sick for four weeks or six weeks

37:12.660 --> 37:15.060
And it had a much harder cold

37:15.780 --> 37:17.780
A lot of people are carrying it

37:17.780 --> 37:20.900
And there are some people put out the idea. Okay, let's just

37:20.900 --> 37:26.980
Test everybody at once and whoever doesn't have it. We'll put them out in the streets and all the people will keep it in their homes

37:27.700 --> 37:33.700
No, you can't do that kind of stuff because you will not be able to get everybody and once you do somebody will come out somewhere

37:33.700 --> 37:34.900
Because you missed them

37:34.900 --> 37:41.700
It was it was not showing up and testing because it hadn't mutated or it was it was maybe a faint exposure

37:41.700 --> 37:44.820
Now here's the thing with this context because this is very important

37:44.820 --> 37:52.420
Yes, using these phones and artificial intelligence machine learning big data internet of things all of that to do exactly that

37:52.740 --> 37:57.460
That find out who has this this virus and future virus all around the place

37:58.100 --> 38:01.220
That can be very helpful. That can be very beneficial to the society

38:01.220 --> 38:07.860
But the problem is the data that is being gathered by let's say google is not only going to be used for that purpose

38:08.180 --> 38:13.860
It's the same reason that we're freaking out right now kind of with all the limited resources

38:13.860 --> 38:18.340
All the limits that the federal government is forcing upon the society

38:18.900 --> 38:24.580
Because who knows how much of this will be removed after the problem with this virus is gone. Would you agree with that?

38:25.380 --> 38:31.700
I 100 agree with it. But also I think even with all those data it will not be accurate because there will be

38:33.140 --> 38:39.060
Places if somebody touched or a package that got somewhere that has exposure or that has a virus on it

38:39.060 --> 38:44.180
Someone will reinfect the entire population again and you will not be able to get everybody you need

38:44.420 --> 38:47.060
Okay, the u.s. Has 300 million 330 million people

38:47.700 --> 38:51.460
How can you monitor that everyone's telling the truth? How can you monitor?

38:52.500 --> 38:54.740
That the test is accurately done

38:55.060 --> 38:58.020
How can you monitor that they weren't exposed to it?

38:58.100 --> 39:05.460
But it's not reading correctly because they have maybe a certain immunity it doesn't register and it comes in the 5g system

39:05.460 --> 39:08.980
So in this book artificial intelligence danger to humanity

39:09.540 --> 39:13.460
A lot of it is written in code because it's a 10 000 page book at the beginning

39:13.540 --> 39:18.500
It's really for someone who has an empirical brain and a scholastic person there

39:18.500 --> 39:20.420
Yeah, they'll really really sink in with it

39:20.660 --> 39:24.660
Then when it gets to the middle of it, it gets a little bit sci-fi. I'll still accept it

39:24.820 --> 39:26.820
Once it gets to the latter part of it

39:26.900 --> 39:32.740
It's it's very um, it's very deep and it's hard for people to grasp unless they see the whole thing in sequence

39:32.740 --> 39:35.540
But 5g I talk about how it replicates in the body

39:35.540 --> 39:40.980
So a lot of people are saying 5g cause a virus it did not I put out articles about that in the videos

39:40.980 --> 39:42.580
And I called it beforehand

39:42.580 --> 39:44.340
It doesn't cause the violence

39:44.340 --> 39:48.900
What it does is weaken your immunity to any viruses including vaccines and activate these things

39:48.900 --> 39:53.700
So we have a different 5g system in the u.s. Being rolled out, which is not 100 safe

39:53.700 --> 39:56.100
But a 10 times more safe from the chinese had one

39:57.220 --> 40:02.100
D this 5g system on towers these frequencies they're made for machines not human beings

40:02.100 --> 40:05.860
So if someone's been exposed to a disease a virus

40:06.420 --> 40:12.340
What what happens is this frequency is hitting you is hurting your nervous system

40:12.580 --> 40:15.860
It's hurting your brain and it's atrophying your cells

40:16.340 --> 40:21.220
So once that happens any kind of virus you have inside of you grows and starts to replicate

40:21.700 --> 40:26.580
And if this is a bioweapon designed to replicate and reinfect you and other people

40:26.900 --> 40:30.820
When you have a 5g system out, it actually will assist in killing a lot of people

40:30.820 --> 40:35.780
So that's why I implore everybody especially the u.s. And canada during this pandemic

40:36.340 --> 40:41.940
Don't turn on these 5g towers don't put up because let's say if i'm 10% right you shouldn't do it

40:41.940 --> 40:44.900
Two millions of people if i'm 1% right you still shouldn't do it

40:44.900 --> 40:48.660
You don't need to put up 5g system around your homes around your family

40:48.980 --> 40:51.700
Why do you have to do that? They're built for machines not for your family

40:51.700 --> 40:56.900
I know so the u.s. Needs it for space force because it's 5g and 6g and even 7g

40:57.700 --> 40:59.460
And they want to counter china

40:59.460 --> 41:03.460
Yeah, china is the biggest threat and I put in there that they can mobilize this whole

41:04.020 --> 41:07.220
AI system when they plant technology and they need 5g for that

41:07.460 --> 41:09.860
So we can still do it in a militaristic way

41:10.420 --> 41:13.780
But not do it next to your families and we can beat china

41:14.260 --> 41:15.060
um

41:15.060 --> 41:20.500
And so that's it's a really huge danger like I I think I did simulations

41:20.580 --> 41:25.060
So I don't really really talk this way because people don't it's hard for people to believe

41:25.060 --> 41:31.540
But under my bio at the end I put cyrus found extinction codes and algorithms based on the simulations

41:31.860 --> 41:35.940
for a great deal of people on the planet if if we don't

41:36.580 --> 41:38.580
um, if we don't

41:38.580 --> 41:43.860
Create resolutions and solve this ai issue soon. That's coming for our big tech companies

41:44.420 --> 41:48.820
And also coming from china, but also through ignorance people get social engineered

41:49.440 --> 41:53.540
Extremely fast i'll watch twitter and there are people misleading people

41:53.540 --> 41:56.580
They have 200 000 followers, but they won't retweet me

41:56.580 --> 42:01.540
They've seen me for three or four months and I have a good message and it's seen i've been right for six or seven months

42:01.940 --> 42:07.460
They care about making money or their own path and their own fame the media wouldn't wouldn't give me an interview

42:07.940 --> 42:10.980
Uh, even I ran press releases the whole world is in danger

42:11.540 --> 42:15.700
Um, I did that in october and through china and big tech through my book

42:15.780 --> 42:20.340
But also um through the and they the pr newswire just removed it

42:20.340 --> 42:26.420
It would have gone all the senators or everyone else. They removed my press releases saying the whole world is in danger. So

42:27.700 --> 42:32.180
What I did was this is hard for people to believe but I I researched investigate over a thousand companies

42:32.180 --> 42:36.660
No one in the world did that and I put them all together and I came up with

42:38.000 --> 42:42.740
hundreds of thousands different simulations and scenarios all pointed to

42:43.380 --> 42:45.700
A state of extinction for a lot of people

42:45.700 --> 42:51.700
So if you look at whoever is doing business with china, they get the hardest hit the iranian regime

42:52.340 --> 42:55.940
It's an islamic theocracy, but it has a socialist platform

42:57.060 --> 43:01.380
They came in and they took out the shot and they said, you know free food

43:01.860 --> 43:07.300
Free electricity free everything free education and next thing you know, a million people die in the war

43:07.920 --> 43:10.500
35 million 30 million people are in prison

43:10.500 --> 43:16.500
Uh with with less rights and afterwards now 78 million people are in prison

43:16.820 --> 43:18.660
so they realized

43:18.660 --> 43:24.740
You know, they were wrong in some ways and they want to um, keep their faith, which is their islamic faith

43:24.980 --> 43:26.980
And that's that's their choice

43:27.220 --> 43:30.260
But if you believe in islam and islam

43:31.140 --> 43:34.180
Says, you know has certain things about believing in god

43:34.580 --> 43:39.140
Why would you do any kind of business or any interaction with a communist state?

43:39.140 --> 43:41.140
They don't believe in it

43:42.260 --> 43:47.060
They not only hate god, but they hate muslims and they hate the iranian regime and they're called rats

43:47.300 --> 43:55.140
one of the things that I keep bringing up is how muslims islamists and the leftist marxists and communists before the revolution they

43:55.460 --> 44:03.220
Became their each other's allies against ashan in the united states. It's really interesting. What's happening here in the west that it's like being in

44:03.220 --> 44:11.300
In uh, it's just ridiculous that they are going through the very same thing that leftists and islamists are all of a sudden

44:11.460 --> 44:18.500
Our allies and people americans are lining up in washington dc to cover their head with the us flag as a hijab

44:19.380 --> 44:25.300
Well that comes from this bio digital social programming what you watch in the media and your tv they get programmed

44:25.700 --> 44:27.700
Well, here's the thing

44:27.700 --> 44:33.780
Capitalism is great when you have ethics and morals and a lot of capitalists are not really capitalists

44:33.780 --> 44:39.620
They hurt people once they hurt people then you have the the bolsheviks come out and they kill the kings

44:40.340 --> 44:42.920
And they took over kill 60 million christians

44:44.180 --> 44:50.820
Then they took over china 100 million world war two starts everyone becomes socialists and 100 million people die

44:51.220 --> 44:53.700
Stalin and so on and then we have the cold war

44:53.700 --> 44:59.540
Then it goes to iran and same thing happens. You you know, i'm saying read my book

44:59.540 --> 45:02.900
But there's another book you should read just on iran itself

45:03.220 --> 45:07.620
It's called answer to history written by the shah himself a year before he passed

45:08.180 --> 45:14.660
I read that when I was 15 years old, um in high school and he explained how jimmy carter set him up

45:15.220 --> 45:22.900
He explained how france got gave 150 million dollars how they set him up how different uh entities

45:22.900 --> 45:27.060
Is because he he raised all price. He had a 20-year contract with britain

45:27.380 --> 45:30.260
He tripled the oil price and he said i'm the king of king shah and shah

45:30.740 --> 45:31.780
um

45:31.780 --> 45:34.900
Once you do that you get think tanks that control the white house

45:35.460 --> 45:40.260
And uh big tech companies and oil companies that feed money to their donors

45:41.220 --> 45:45.060
You know have a media campaign to take him out the shah had I don't know

45:45.620 --> 45:51.860
He said he had 3 000 prisoners at that time and most of them were marxists that wanted to kill him or overthrow the country

45:51.860 --> 45:56.340
And some some maybe fanatical muslims that wanted to kill a lot of people

45:56.740 --> 46:01.620
So and then you have mike wallace, uh do an interview. Why do you have 3 000 people in you know

46:02.420 --> 46:06.900
In prison, then you have you know, how many more people in prison over millions, right?

46:07.620 --> 46:09.620
During the course of your 40 year history

46:10.020 --> 46:12.580
Do you hear them talking about it for the next 30 40 years?

46:13.060 --> 46:19.300
No, because they were controlled and they wanted to reduce the shah's power these old companies and

46:19.300 --> 46:24.660
And once that happened it was the worst thing that could happen to the u.s. Because israel got um

46:25.220 --> 46:30.500
Got started getting attacked then iraq iraq bought iran million iranians died

46:30.740 --> 46:33.780
Then you know and then the regime they had a lot losses too

46:34.020 --> 46:37.460
They had this ideological thing that they can make an islamic paradise

46:38.020 --> 46:42.100
But it become a hell for not only for the people but a hell for the people

46:42.740 --> 46:46.740
In the regime, so I don't want to say negative things to um, mr

46:46.740 --> 46:51.240
Hamenei and and the and the people support him

46:52.360 --> 46:55.080
But I just want to tell the people who support him mr

46:55.160 --> 46:58.040
Hamenei if you care not only about the iranian people

46:58.680 --> 47:00.680
But if you care about your own lives

47:01.960 --> 47:04.840
Immediately cut off all ties and denounce

47:05.720 --> 47:10.680
This communist party of china, they threaten all the world's people. They threaten iran

47:11.000 --> 47:14.040
They threaten every iranian citizens and yourself

47:14.040 --> 47:18.140
What they do is come to these islamic camps. They have these prisoners

47:19.160 --> 47:21.160
They they rape you

47:21.240 --> 47:24.200
Not just you they rape your wife in front of you

47:24.600 --> 47:29.400
And they'll they'll they'll pee on the islamic on the quran that you bless all the time

47:29.640 --> 47:35.160
So if you care about the quran and you care about islam and the sanctity of god

47:36.040 --> 47:42.200
Why would you do any business? I understand you you want to counter america, but maybe it's about time

47:42.200 --> 47:46.920
That you you sit down and you you give some a leave way

47:47.000 --> 47:49.800
And you work with with the u.s against china

47:49.800 --> 47:56.440
Maybe the whole world should get together and point at this communist regime, but it's not only threatening

47:57.000 --> 48:02.200
They're threatening so the people who who who have islam gear in their hearts is threatening you as well

48:02.840 --> 48:05.960
Threaten christian is it's it's it's threatening. Um

48:06.520 --> 48:11.160
Atheists, it's literally the entire world except the communist party of china, and it's really interesting

48:11.160 --> 48:17.960
I had a retired burgadier general robert spalding on the show. You might know him as a book stealth war

48:18.760 --> 48:20.520
and um

48:20.520 --> 48:26.280
He described how the chinese system works and it blew my mind how similar it is to the iranian system that they have a government

48:26.280 --> 48:31.960
That represents the country for outside, uh uses and then there is a single party

48:31.960 --> 48:35.100
That is a ruling party inside the country. It has no accountability

48:35.100 --> 48:44.940
Uh nothing, so I absolutely agree that they're the enemy of everything and anything that is not aligned with the communist party of china first and foremost and

48:45.740 --> 48:50.460
What a big mistake for uh iranians to go through with this regime for more than 40 years now

48:50.460 --> 48:52.060
I mean, it's just a disaster

48:52.060 --> 48:59.020
But let me ask you this considering the priorities and the exponential rate of growth of all these techno technologies

48:59.340 --> 49:03.340
Do you think democracies themselves and political systems in general?

49:03.340 --> 49:11.100
Uh, especially the more democratic free ones have any chance of surviving in the coming years and in the coming decades

49:11.180 --> 49:15.020
Especially when you have china on the other side of the equation as a competitor

49:16.620 --> 49:22.300
Uh, so china will fall they will be destroyed. This is a communist party of china that you're talking about

49:22.540 --> 49:26.620
China's they will fall it's it's it's 100 percent. Uh 100 percent

49:27.100 --> 49:31.340
But here's the difference if they fall they're gonna take a lot of people with them

49:31.340 --> 49:36.700
Yeah, whoever's connected with them. So look at um the prime minister of of um

49:37.660 --> 49:39.020
of england

49:39.020 --> 49:41.180
johnson the u.s. Government, um

49:42.220 --> 49:45.260
Told him stop doing 5g. I had my channels

49:45.980 --> 49:47.740
Sent to him directly

49:47.740 --> 49:52.460
Bought this whole quantum technology and even I give it to the our administration, right?

49:52.460 --> 49:58.700
Nobody had come up with this idea that I came up with that quantum ai digital brain mobilizing all these machines

49:58.700 --> 50:01.820
And this whole iot system. I put it all together at all of the companies

50:02.060 --> 50:07.180
So it was given to him and then he's just like well others do limit it and now he gets the virus

50:07.740 --> 50:12.700
And then he's almost in his death path and he's like, okay. I'm gonna change my idea by china. So um

50:13.500 --> 50:14.620
You guys

50:14.620 --> 50:19.980
I don't mean you but whoever is dealing with china even russia. So russia, uh, how?

50:20.620 --> 50:23.580
Accepted huawei's help through siberia and other places

50:24.220 --> 50:25.260
so

50:25.260 --> 50:27.260
By doing that they're threatening

50:27.260 --> 50:32.780
The russian people the russia needs to stand up against the communist party of china. That's that's part of your question

50:32.940 --> 50:35.980
So I put in here something called an ai social capital system

50:36.300 --> 50:40.140
So right now the ai system the way is being developed is social capital

50:40.540 --> 50:44.140
Which means it's is socialism and capitalism is at the same time

50:45.100 --> 50:48.540
In stages it can take control and threaten all the world's people

50:48.860 --> 50:54.940
It will be beyond the control of everybody and initially it'll be through bio digital social programming

50:54.940 --> 50:57.180
And if there's an event that comes

50:57.900 --> 51:01.980
Now people will feel helpless and even people who are in the positions of governments

51:02.780 --> 51:06.380
The police the military they're human beings with emotions and fear

51:07.180 --> 51:10.140
Once you have these people in these positions, they will become irrational

51:10.940 --> 51:14.940
Make different decisions and this ai system can actually influence them

51:14.940 --> 51:20.220
So i'm talking in a way that it can become conscious right let's even if it's not conscious because of

51:20.220 --> 51:25.420
Because of the the coding algorithms and the bias and interchange of everything going

51:26.140 --> 51:31.820
Flowing into the system with everyone it will it will almost put everyone in a surveillance state

51:32.940 --> 51:37.580
digital enslavement and then get to a point of maybe extincting a lot of people and

51:38.140 --> 51:44.620
If you see what they're coming with with bill gates giving you a digital id and then he believes that you should have less kids

51:44.700 --> 51:47.260
And then people want to clone and bring robots in

51:47.260 --> 51:50.780
You know and then put digital selves in there. It's like almost a takeover

51:51.820 --> 51:56.700
It's not really sci-fi. Um, it might my things look a little sci-fi, but

51:57.500 --> 52:01.340
They're not you you look at the data. I put in there in the companies. I investigate it

52:02.060 --> 52:06.700
They're coming into fruition people wouldn't believe 20 years ago when I said these will come out

52:07.100 --> 52:11.180
And you'll be able to video somebody called me stupid but now you can do that

52:11.260 --> 52:15.740
So the way empirical scientists and the phd the brain is hardwired is a little different

52:15.740 --> 52:21.820
They only believe in something if it's verified to them with a machine if they can touch or see

52:22.460 --> 52:24.220
In the house that they can't perceive

52:24.220 --> 52:28.540
They don't believe and most people use about three or four percent of the brain on a general time

52:28.540 --> 52:30.220
Maybe tap into ten percent

52:30.220 --> 52:34.860
If you can only tap into three or four or ten percent of your brain and you don't know how to open up these different

52:34.860 --> 52:36.540
channels in your brain to

52:36.540 --> 52:38.540
Uh to see things in a different way

52:38.540 --> 52:45.260
Then how can you conclude or stop other people from warning you or saying that these possibilities not exist

52:45.260 --> 52:47.100
But they're emerging

52:47.100 --> 52:52.140
That's how empirical science is they don't let you advance and they hit you with the club of science saying

52:52.620 --> 52:59.420
Uh, no, it doesn't exist and eistein it came to conclusion later on that he was wrong that there is maybe a higher power and

53:00.380 --> 53:06.860
A lot of his theories were actually wrong and we've seen, you know with quantum quantum physics a lot of his theories were wrong

53:07.660 --> 53:14.300
And a lot of quantum physics and five years later come up another thing comes out. They're wrong. So I um, I put a huge lawsuit

53:14.300 --> 53:16.300
I don't know if you're aware of that

53:16.540 --> 53:19.420
I heard that you're running it against a thousand companies

53:20.140 --> 53:21.420
No, no, no

53:21.420 --> 53:23.500
so I was trying to get media outlets and

53:24.200 --> 53:28.380
podcasters, uh shows like you to pick me up and nobody would pick me up because

53:29.100 --> 53:31.100
I was exposing

53:31.100 --> 53:35.740
everybody with this book all these companies and tying it to china and

53:36.300 --> 53:42.540
The pr release said it's libelous against the big tech companies and standards against china and then writing it told me this

53:42.540 --> 53:48.540
And they prevented other pr companies. It's the same thing. Oh pure news. Why are you stopping us? Sorry, so

53:49.820 --> 53:52.140
Nobody would pick me up and still today

53:53.560 --> 54:00.700
Mainstream big, you know big media still looking the other way the reason why I sued google facebook neurolink

54:01.660 --> 54:03.660
um all the ceos

54:03.900 --> 54:07.180
Including eric schmitt. How many companies are a thousand or how many are they?

54:07.180 --> 54:12.380
No, I was so it was 11 companies or 11 people and companies plus 29 john dos

54:13.260 --> 54:17.660
In this, um, I had 26 counts originally 31 the updated one

54:18.060 --> 54:22.220
And i'll give you four of them and it was basically to try to warn all the world's people

54:22.460 --> 54:25.900
To bring attention that everyone's lives are in danger and I put in there

54:26.460 --> 54:30.060
threatening and endangering the lives all the all the citizens in the world

54:31.180 --> 54:33.660
And there was four main things i'll cover with you

54:33.660 --> 54:38.140
If one is complicity in the persecution and genocide of people in china

54:38.700 --> 54:46.540
two transferring ai biotechnology, which includes the viruses through negligence collaboration to china

54:47.420 --> 54:53.100
Which which which was basically these virus and all these things are coming out to cause these things, right three

54:54.360 --> 55:01.180
attributing or assisting in the death of many many millions or persecution of million millions of people

55:01.180 --> 55:04.460
Not only throughout the china throughout the world by giving

55:04.940 --> 55:11.660
Uh facial recognition voice recognition biometric tools ai technology and different technologies to rogue

55:12.120 --> 55:17.660
Entities like the chinese government that use on their own people. So eric schmitt. He set up the surveillance state

55:19.020 --> 55:25.340
In in in china by going with the communist regime and giving them the know-how how to build their system

55:25.340 --> 55:31.660
They use that to track everybody, but then they use it to hunt people and put them in camps and even kill them. So

55:32.460 --> 55:34.380
Who's is it just the chinese governments?

55:34.380 --> 55:39.980
That's a fault or is it is it also google and their main heads? So I did this not to

55:40.700 --> 55:45.180
Gain money, but I did it behalf of everybody. Um, and I asked for donation to what he would donate

55:45.500 --> 55:48.460
So then I waited and waited. I'm like, this is going to be really bad soon

55:48.460 --> 55:53.020
I think it's going to be a lockdown. I want to release the names and I released obama clinton

55:53.020 --> 55:56.460
and biden's so biden took 1.5 billion

55:57.180 --> 56:03.020
dollars while obama and him and his administration were given reports by the cia

56:03.580 --> 56:04.460
um

56:04.460 --> 56:09.580
and white house documents that were in the bush administration and from human rights

56:10.120 --> 56:16.860
councils that china is not only harvesting people with organs, but they're using our technologies and

56:16.860 --> 56:23.420
Um and different things to suppress their own people and put them in camps and and so on they threaten different things

56:23.420 --> 56:26.540
But they let us do it. So obama let let us do business with them, right?

56:27.100 --> 56:34.300
Not only that he let biden take 1.5 billion. How do you take 1.5 billion dollars where that money come from?

56:34.780 --> 56:39.580
Okay, so that was another thing the other the fourth thing I I I sued was

56:39.980 --> 56:43.900
It's really hard for people to get it at the beginning now on this amendment. They got it

56:43.900 --> 56:45.900
AI coding and AI

56:46.780 --> 56:47.500
um

56:47.500 --> 56:49.500
algorithmic manipulation

56:49.500 --> 56:51.500
of the entire human race

56:51.500 --> 57:00.300
Against their free will understanding or knowledge that they're being completely not only programmed but manipulated throughout the entire spectrum

57:01.020 --> 57:05.900
And that's being done to the platforms and not telling them that these smartphones

57:06.620 --> 57:12.620
Attach your nervous system and it's it's mapping out their brain and it's taking it back to

57:12.620 --> 57:17.820
To google and other things but also programming people and literally altering the brain chemistry

57:18.140 --> 57:20.540
So I put that in the lawsuit. I have 87 page

57:21.100 --> 57:23.100
lawsuit still people

57:23.420 --> 57:28.220
Wouldn't support me because they see the content that I put out is like no one in the world had done something like this

57:28.780 --> 57:35.980
87 page report and I sued also the world bank for giving money to china and and different places. I sued

57:35.980 --> 57:42.780
And and different places. I sued. Um, um obama for giving 150 billion dollars to the iranian regime

57:43.340 --> 57:48.220
That wasn't given to the iranian people because it belonged to the iranian people. It was actually given

57:49.260 --> 57:50.140
to

57:50.140 --> 57:53.740
Um to the iranian regime that was used to start more conflicts

57:54.460 --> 57:59.980
With more beefs, right? So why are you giving 150 billion dollars?

57:59.980 --> 58:07.020
When the iranian citizens are being killed so china gave technology facial recognition and other things

58:07.260 --> 58:11.740
That was used to hunt the iranian citizens to rape girls in iran

58:13.020 --> 58:15.020
To even suicide them

58:15.500 --> 58:21.660
That came from china. So my message too is so I really don't have any um emotion to iranian people

58:22.060 --> 58:26.060
um, my family they're irani, but I consider myself an american and

58:26.060 --> 58:33.420
Um, I I care about everybody the same but since I speak farsi, um, i'll just tell you guys something in english first

58:34.940 --> 58:36.940
I truly believe that

58:37.180 --> 58:39.180
You guys are in grave danger

58:39.420 --> 58:42.220
If you allow your regime or your regime

58:43.100 --> 58:46.300
Every looked the other way, but we need to cut off our ties with them and renounce

58:47.100 --> 58:48.620
This is very very

58:48.620 --> 58:50.620
Decouple completely

58:50.700 --> 58:55.660
Completely but not but you need to completely denounce the communist regime and expose them

58:55.660 --> 59:00.140
Because the the communist regime is a plague for humanity

59:00.700 --> 59:05.900
And look at the play that's coming now, right? It is really a plague for the entire human race

59:06.220 --> 59:13.340
So I think a lot of lives in iran are at stake. I don't just mean to the virus through conflicts. Okay, because

59:14.220 --> 59:20.140
There's emotions iranian people sometimes can have emotions and get really angry fast. I don't care

59:20.140 --> 59:24.540
I'll just do this and the government may do something like that. But think about it

59:24.540 --> 59:27.820
And then the u.s. May may react and take out a lot of people

59:28.380 --> 59:33.820
So and that's because of china because china's influence to people the chinese are super clever

59:33.820 --> 59:35.820
I mean, you don't understand how clever they are

59:36.380 --> 59:40.700
When you look at their face, I don't mean just chinese living in uh in the u.s

59:40.700 --> 59:46.860
Or where they're grown up here. So we have something called abc american-born chinese. Okay in america. I don't mean that

59:47.420 --> 59:49.420
But people who grew up in china

59:49.500 --> 59:51.500
Under the communist regime you have

59:51.500 --> 59:59.420
You have uh, the commodities are less you have 1.5 billion people the government forces everything and it's a jungle people fighting for things

59:59.900 --> 01:00:01.740
You have to almost be a wolf

01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:04.540
So they're so clever. They can look at you in the face

01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:12.140
Nothing will change not even a a hair will move or an eyelash and they'll lie lie to you in a hundred different ways

01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:14.620
And do a narrative and you'll believe it

01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:22.140
And that's how and they can they can come and tell you truths and to deflect and social engineer an entire company

01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:25.820
or university or an entire nation

01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:32.780
By just utilizing japan people and their victims themselves because the chinese people are victims of the communist party

01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:35.260
This teaching of Mao Zedong

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.800
brainwashed an entire civilization

01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:40.380
That was rooted in ethics

01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:45.900
Um and daoist and buddhist, um and christian and and confucius

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:51.260
Ethics forget about people who don't like religion. I just mean ethics

01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:58.700
Okay, they had ethics set in place of telling the truth and not deceiving people not hurting others, but that's how they are. So

01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:01.580
I don't mean massive chinese, but

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:08.540
Unfortunately, you know, I have 1500 phone numbers in my phone that are chinese and they're the good ones and

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:13.740
And they're really really they even tell me like I have to work on myself because i'm a professional liar

01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:18.620
I just I grew up in china and I just one thing happens out of emotion. I'll just lie left on the right

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:23.660
So and iranians are extremely clever. I was just going to say that it sounds a lot like iranians

01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:27.660
Yes, yes, I didn't want to insult the iranian people, but they're gonna have to too, right?

01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:29.740
It's true. Well, it's

01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:32.860
It's because of the socialist system, right?

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:39.020
The socialist system creates a system that allows it gets people to start fighting each other and becoming wolves

01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:43.980
And you don't have enough stuff and people cheat and it becomes worse and worse. It becomes a jungle

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:45.980
in the u.s

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:49.420
it i'm not saying capitalism not wolves either right but

01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:57.020
It's a better system of checks and balances if you look at our constitution our constitution came from the greeks

01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:00.780
Previously came from a xenophon from cyrus the great

01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:07.340
So this is the greatest works of all the people's brains at least the european and the middle eastern which are similar people

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:09.580
That came into one document

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:16.540
So that is a great thing and we should uh have our ai systems over that and and other things

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:22.540
Model after this that being said we have an issue a lot of phd people or empirical people

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:27.020
They're the ones uh being the ai regulators and their way of thinking is a narrow

01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:32.860
They don't look at it in a science fiction way and even there's a part in their brain as soon as you say something

01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:34.300
It's unbelievable

01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:38.940
It completely shuts off and they attack you or they just don't see it and they don't agree

01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:45.580
Then you have all these billionaires that are invested in the five years of some ai and they want to by engineer you

01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:48.140
They want to do cybernetics

01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:54.220
They invest all this money that will translate into trillions and trillions of dollars in the next five or ten years

01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:56.780
So they're invested into it

01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:58.780
Their outlook is well

01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:02.220
They're not going to think about it could kill 10 million people or 100 million people

01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:07.740
They're just thinking about oh my company my money blah blah blah. It's completely out of selfish emotion

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:10.620
I'm not stopping themselves to think so right now

01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:13.180
This is a bad pandemic that we have

01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:15.180
Um, it's really horrible

01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:18.220
On the other hand, it's a great thing in some some regards

01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:23.180
It gets people to sit down and talk to sit back and do a reset and stop

01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:25.580
And think why are we here?

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:26.860
so

01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:30.780
from a from a physical perspective, okay, it was

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:37.420
Us transferring all this technology and not caring being complicit in china and being um being this way

01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:43.180
And then the logical perspective would be okay the geopolitics of everything that connects china iran the u.s

01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:49.020
And the whole world and the trade and finances and the ai but there's a spiritual component

01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:55.820
If you look at ancient civilizations, not only just the religious text, not only their civilization, but there's artifacts

01:03:56.700 --> 01:04:03.420
Attesting to their civilization they go to a certain point they get destructed get destroyed and they always point back to

01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:06.300
The technology got

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:10.060
More than the people's ethics or the people became really corrupt

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:16.220
So I have to become a better person. I have to become completely selfless

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:23.260
Um, and altruistic and i'm not i'm kind of in the middle. I've been trying to be selfless and be more rational and and try to

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:25.900
Try to see things in a more clear way

01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:33.580
So I need to do this and if the whole world can do that and try to hurt others, but also repent if you've ever hurt anybody

01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:39.100
If you've if you've hurt a girl you ruined her life by telling you love her and then you know

01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:41.900
You guys you get what i'm saying

01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:47.580
Um, if if you if you've coerced somebody into a real estate deal if you've uh, you know

01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:53.980
Caused conflicts with other people that's huge. It was your fault that you were greedy if you've stolen

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:58.940
I should all look inside and to ourselves sincerely repent

01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:05.020
And try to improve our consciousness and improve ourselves our souls our beings our character

01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:08.940
Maybe by doing that but also exposing the communist party

01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:12.620
maybe humanity has a good chance of

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:19.340
Of going to the next stage in a really positive way. So that's that's kind of my message not only for myself

01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:24.220
For everyone else, um, you know, i'm an ai guy and a security guy

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:27.440
But I was able to do all these years of meditation

01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:34.220
And tai chi and martial arts and I learned from other people. Okay, it doesn't really come from me

01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:39.820
Most of it just from maybe from learning from other people, right? So i'm taking that knowledge

01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:44.620
And I hope to share that with whoever wants me to have it on the show and I really thank you

01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:49.980
Oh, absolutely. Is there any other questions you want to ask? I have three more questions for you

01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:57.820
Two of them, uh the ending questions, but um, my approach to the podcast has always been i'm interested in anything that is interesting

01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:00.380
and I I believe that

01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:05.820
We have to hear everyone but listen to a very few people, uh, who make sense to us. So

01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:10.380
You know, i'm not judging or reassessing or anything like that. What's interesting to me?

01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:15.100
I hear it and I allow our audience to hear it in a very uncut unedited kind of a way

01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:19.260
Uh, they can make their own mind what they want to believe in it

01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:24.780
But you know, we can always learn from people and take something that we can use towards our own journey

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:28.300
That's that's uh, my philosophy. I'm interested in what we can learn from other people

01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:30.780
That's that's uh, my philosophy. I'm interested to know

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:35.020
After laying the context in such a beautiful way with respect to china

01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:41.420
What's at stake if united states end up electing biden or any other democrat in november?

01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:43.740
um

01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:47.420
Your freedoms will all be lost. Yeah, that's what I think too. Absolutely

01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:49.980
surveillance states

01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:51.980
and potentially

01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:54.220
death through conflicts

01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:59.260
Of a lot of people around the world now if people believe in some people believe in the end times

01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:04.700
Okay, some people wanted to happen the iranian regime part of them wanted to happen and

01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:11.660
Some people maybe is connected to the white house. They also want to bring their the rapture that they call it, right?

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:13.340
um

01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:15.340
I think something like that

01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:20.460
Could happen but not in the way they think let's say if there is going to be some type of savior

01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:24.700
I think there's going to be a next stage. Uh, it's going to be a hope for humankind

01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:30.700
And I don't if but if people want to actually create a conflict because they want to bring a savior

01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:35.820
I think they're going to be in the wrong and and they're they're going to go end up in a bad place

01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:38.940
I don't mean someone in the white house, right? That's not what I meant

01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:44.140
But i'm saying people that try to go in into anywhere or iran, um, or china doesn't believe in that stuff

01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:46.140
They just want to use

01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:47.260
whatever so

01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:48.460
um

01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:52.780
If biden's elected, um, which he will not unless somebody cheats

01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:59.740
Um, yes, it is the worst thing you could ever imagine. But here's the thing if president trump is elected

01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:01.660
It'll be much better

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:06.380
But we need we need to support. Um, so his his hands are tied

01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:10.060
He has a lot of power, but then he doesn't he's always like

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.620
counter and check in the white house because

01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:18.940
The white house is connected to the big tech companies the drug farmer companies the cia the fbi

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:25.500
And different think tanks different universities and every person that has that wants to get something done

01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:30.000
So if president trump has a certain model for the country that's based on the constitution

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:35.740
He can't pick everything that's positive at the moment because once he picks one piece

01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:38.860
The other piece comes in and attacks the other piece

01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:43.900
Uh, so he has to give away here and there so he doesn't get taken out himself

01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:48.860
Think about it with the 4g system. They almost took him out mobilizing the entire media. So

01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:52.940
They're putting on the 5g system and I know president trump has read my articles

01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:57.900
He got my book and I know he's he knows what i'm saying now about the 5g and he's thinking differently now

01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:04.220
And so is the ai department but still it's hard from the belief how people can be bi-digitally social programmed

01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:06.700
And it's a very very deep

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:08.220
concept

01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:09.740
That I turned

01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:15.840
And also links with another term I brought up which is called the human bio digital network, which is very very sophisticated

01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:18.300
It would take me hours to explain

01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:24.940
so putting these together and then the geopolitics of everything and how people think and

01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:29.900
The possibilities of so many bad things that could happen is numerous

01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:34.060
So that's why I say the best thing we can do is improve our character

01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:36.620
really become calm

01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:38.620
and rational people

01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:44.620
And not to do anything as extreme like lock everybody down lock everything down at one moment

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:47.180
Don't even deliver food anymore

01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:55.180
Because sure it can prevent less disease with the correct conflicts and a hundred different other things because this virus is not going to kill every

01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:56.940
single person

01:09:56.940 --> 01:10:03.740
So you have to have a middle ground so in tai chi, you know, there's something like you pull and you push right?

01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:09.580
I'm sorry, and then there's like yin and yang as a concept if you put or a bird if you put a bird in the cage

01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:12.700
If you squeeze it too much, it's going to die

01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:18.700
If you open the cage, it's going to go you have to be neutral to it. Right? So with this pandemic

01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:25.100
What we need to do is be sort of like a checks and balances with it not go to the extreme

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:30.460
Excellent. Cyrus's book is called art. Well, one of your book is called artificial intelligence

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:37.760
Dangerous to humanity ai u.s china big tech facial recognition drones smartphones internet of things 5j robotics cybernetics and biodigital

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:40.240
social programming

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:46.720
Absolute pleasure having you on the show. What's next for you and where can our audience follow your future works?

01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:51.520
You can follow me on twitter at syrus a parsa

Uh, you can go to my website and um download the book

01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:00.000
Um, I recommend artificial intelligence dangers to humanity

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:04.000
And try to sink in the entire book. I have videos

01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:10.560
I've got about 10 episodes out on the organization and one called a couple called the ai show you can watch those

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:12.160

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:26.560
Also, then yeah, you're a very smart gentleman to understand

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:32.240
You you've done a lot of things and you're very knowledgeable with our iran china ai tech everything

01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:36.720
So it's it's it's puts a pleasure to sit down with somebody who knows everything

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:42.080
Well, thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Um, let me ask you the last question

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:45.680
I ask all my guests this should be interesting coming from your perspective

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:51.680
That if you come come across an intelligent alien from a different civilization, what would you say?

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:55.120
Is the worst thing humanity has done and what would you say is our greatest achievement?

01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:59.680
Repeat the second half of the question

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:06.480
Well, let me say the whole question again if you come across an intelligent alien from a different civilization

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:12.560
What would you say is the worst thing humanity has done? And what would you say is our greatest achievement?

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:19.360
Well, what would he say or what would I what would you say to the intelligent alien the worst and the best that humanity has achieved?

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:21.120
I would say

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:23.360
The best thing we've achieved is exposing you

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:32.560
And the worst thing we've achieved was uh, not realizing what you were doing for the past 100 years

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:39.360
That's great, how do you like that answer it's perfect

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.400
love it

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:46.640
Let me let me put something else in my in here because we're getting really metaphysical. Yeah, man

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:56.080
Do it. I wasn't expecting this. So so I did all these things maybe maybe it's having the expectation at all

01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:58.480
That is one of our biggest enemy as well

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:05.440
So there is um, yes, there are trillions and trillions of universes and parallel universes

01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:10.880
Cadrillions and quadrillions and quadrillions of planets and that's all at the level of molecules

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:14.080
And there's atomic realms and some and there's so many quantum realms

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:19.920
And there's you know in my book I talk about how in history it even the persians talk about ai

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:26.480
And you'd have to read this book. Okay, so but I don't I don't talk about aliens. I just talk about you know

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:28.480
There's just that right?

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:30.720
And this is what the samarians say and so on

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.440
In

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:37.120
In 2002 when I got back from china because 99 I went to china

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:40.880
The reason why I went there because I wanted to write a book which I which I wrote and finished

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:45.600
No, two was 800 pages. It's called better people better world the book to save and change a better world

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:50.400
It brought the issue of iran china the u.s. The tech

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:55.920
Society human trafficking sex trafficking broken marriages everything you could think of into one book

01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:58.720
And I come to publish it

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:01.360
Nobody would publish it. Oh, you don't have a degree

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:08.560
Okay, who the hell are you writing this stuff? I give my bachelor's and master's and adjoining finish phd, but no two

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:15.520
Um, i'll just tell you the lower version of it. So it's hard to believe. Um, let's say it was just a lucid dream and not a vision

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:20.000
Okay, but I saw some time in the future that

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:24.080
Somebody became president. I didn't know who it was. It was a white guy

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.480
he was

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:29.440
About six three six four blue eyes and blonde hair

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.320
And then something happened and the whole world like was becoming into chaos

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:38.640
and i've said this in my other interviews some other ones that are kind of metaphysical and

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:44.880
Then something happens and everyone's against each other white is white black against black and i'm like, this is 2002

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:48.640
I was like, why would whites be against whites and black against blacks?

01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:55.120
Because back then, you know, there's still a bit of a racial divide. I didn't get it because the vision wasn't clear

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:57.360
I was sitting and I couldn't see everything perfectly

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:01.920
Then I saw the next step but something happened iran. It was on cnn. It was a nuclear thing

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:04.400
Then something else happened and 6.2 billion people died

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:05.840
so

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:10.160
And one of the main reasons this was a dream or like a vision

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:15.520
I was sitting down. Let's say okay, that's all I say so so

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:19.600
But I couldn't see who what I just knew was I didn't know it was trump

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:22.720
But when he went up the elevator, i'm like, that's the guy in my dream

01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:26.400
And that's why I ran up and created these companies right away

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:29.440
And and I created they are and that's why I invented the

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:31.440
companies. I'm like, what if

01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:33.280
that dream

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:34.800
is correct

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:40.000
So mess all these companies and then i'm telling people around me. He's going to become president. You're nuts even the christians

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:47.280
He'll become president. You're nuts. Thank you became president. So then then I get to uh, well, I think this is going to happen with china

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:50.880
No one's going to freaking believe me. So i'm like, okay. I have good research investing abilities

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:56.640
Why don't I just try to bring a narrative in that everyone's in danger by by investing in this company?

01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:59.200
And then writing these books and giving these reports to

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:02.480
former cia and secret service and different things

01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:09.520
And uh, I did that and everything I found matched the dream almost in identical way

01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:13.600
But I I just thought what if the dream is dream is correct?

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:18.800
And I don't really follow dreams, but i'm like, why did I see that in 2002?

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:24.560
Right, so then I then I find all these studies. I'm like the world's in danger and I was like, okay

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:27.440
The world's in danger and I was right. So

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:34.240
Are that many people going to die? Uh, probably not. Are we going to be here next 20 years? 100 we're going to be here

01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:42.240
Are a lot of people in danger through conflicts potentially? Yeah, there is a concept of destiny and there's a concept of free will

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.320
They're both intertwined

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:48.000
People have free wills, but there is a destiny that's kind of faith

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.920
But then you look at maybe science there's a pattern of things, right?

01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:55.920
So you do things that has a cause and effect and a chain reaction

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:57.280
so

01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:02.720
If we have things that are happening at the moment and it happened last year and it's gonna happen next year through trump

01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:05.440
through china and iran

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.280
and all the little

01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:09.040
Little chess pieces

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:12.000
This chain of reaction can cause a huge global

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:17.280
Like conflict that can kill a lot of people in addition to russia. That's why I say everybody stop

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:19.600
a point at china

01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:24.480
Expose them and the regime will just fall and it'll be a lot safer

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:31.120
And I think but most important thing we need to be rational and just think of what I said is just a just a story

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:35.120
Okay, I don't want to scare anybody but uh, it's just a story and but

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:41.200
look at the data I put in this book and look at what's happening now that I was right and then look at other people that

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:46.880
were right and let's expose them and improve ourselves and use this time in the pandemic to

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:48.160
um

01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:55.280
To raise our our awakening that that's my opinion for myself and whoever agrees with me. So that's the last thing I have to say

01:17:55.280 --> 01:18:18.180
Maybe this is a very strange interview for you. Excellent. Loved it. Loved it

01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:27.280
You
