1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
Capitalism is great when you have ethics and morals and a lot of capitalists are not really capitalists. They hurt people

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,280
Hello and welcome to the 71st episode of new human podcasts

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:26,360
I'm a gobbahari etygologist on twitter and instagram and you can follow this show on live in limbo.com itunes youtube bitshoot and

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,640
Bunch of other places are very very important to have presence now these days and with me today

5
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,680
I have the pleasure of having Cyrus a parsa. Welcome to new human podcast Cyrus

6
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,080
Well, thank you have had me on today. Appreciate it. Absolutely

7
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:46,000
Let's start out with your background the work you've done the lives you've lived and what do you mainly focus on now these days?

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,760
Well, I was born in Iran. There was a revolution. We were Muslim. So we had to leave the country in 1987

9
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:59,080
I live in Austria for about six months about seven years in Virginia ten years in Illinois

10
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,120
Chicago area I've been in San Diego for 17 years live in China with

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,800
Wudang fighting monks and the mountains for about almost a year and

12
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,840
Yeah, I got a bachelor's in national security conflict resolution master's of homeland security went through a PhD program didn't finish

13
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:24,840
I ended up investigating over a thousand companies related to artificial intelligence 5g robotics bioengineering cybernetics

14
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,880
I published a couple of books related to that. Mm-hmm. Excellent. You left Iran right after the revolution

15
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,840
1987 okay. Yeah, my father was

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,960
special force training sort of guy for the Shaw so and

17
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,920
We had to leave but it took a while for for things to happen. It wasn't that

18
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,920
Good idea to leave. I was four when you left

19
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:58,240
Okay, um, I came across as I was telling you before we get live I came across you

20
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,320
Through one of your videos that you have an AI show

21
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:08,640
But you also have a book called artificial intelligence dangers to humanity AI US China big tech facial recognition drones

22
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,580
Smartphones about all of those things and I'm showing it to our audience. It's also available on

23
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,280
Amazon which I want to talk about but you also run an organization called the AI organization

24
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,960
You're the CEO of the organization. I believe you're also the founder of the organization

25
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,200
That's correct. So what is what is the objective of what is a organization all about?

26
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,520
So I formed the loyal guardian security

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,320
2017 and the premise was it was to garner support

28
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:43,560
To perceive the coming risks of China big tech and Iran. This is why you're this is

29
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,920
2017 and I was able to influence different things

30
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,160
but then I realized that the artificial intelligence that we studied 20 years ago and

31
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:59,200
People thought it was all science fiction was coming to fruition. So I ended up opening the organization

32
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:06,240
with the wish and hope to safeguard people and the world from the misuse of artificial intelligence

33
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,760
biotechnology including this virus and

34
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,440
AI surveillance that could mobilize drones machines robotics

35
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,520
cybernetics by nation-state entities like for instance China

36
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:26,280
Iran or let's say a socialist platform through the Obama administration of someone like him

37
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,080
Would overtake the u.s. So at the moment people are talking about a digital

38
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,200
Chipping right and putting and tracking everybody. So that's all in my book

39
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,800
What I did was I think 2000

40
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,320
Yeah, early 2019

41
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:49,960
I gave a small brief to the Secret Service that within one or two years if China and big tech is not curtailed

42
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,560
That the whole world is in danger and right now we're in that place

43
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,080
It was June the 15th, I gave a 62 page

44
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,640
Report

45
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,520
Entailing 41 Chinese companies that involve artificial intelligence 5g

46
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,040
biotechnology and by engineering

47
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,840
the conclusion was that China threatens all the world's citizens and

48
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,040
They're working on different ways of poison delivery systems for assassination

49
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:25,640
So I waited and waited and just the time that I realized China's figured out president Trump is not really doing a trade war for a trade

50
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,280
War, but he's trying to take him take him out because of their vast human rights

51
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,280
Atrocities and a threat to the entire world. I published

52
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,280
This book AI Trump China and a weaponization or robotics with 5g

53
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,080
People that I knew in DHS, that's Trump on the on the horse

54
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,640
You know, this has a lot of intermeaning people thought it was comical, but it wasn't no no, no, no

55
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:56,840
No, I i'm exactly asking to understand the deeper meaning in it. So let me explain. Yeah, so that is george washington

56
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,320
right on a horse

57
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,000
I put president trump's head on there that represents the constitution, right?

58
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:09,640
AI trump china and a weaponization of robotics with 5g that was published august 24 2019

59
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:17,400
You have a smartphone showing how people are programmed and their thoughts are influenced societies are are mobilized by smartphones

60
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,240
I call that bio-digital social programming and the age of machines and robotics and cybernetics

61
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,280
People are going to go under transhumanism

62
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:34,360
5g network representing the entire city structure because 5g is not built for human beings. It's built for machines

63
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,520
Um, it's more than that on the bottom. Um, I put how

64
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,640
China and big tech threaten all the world's citizens

65
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:48,920
Uh with I I coined some terms that deal with bio-diseases that engineer disease that we have in my book. I publish that

66
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,560
There's there's a danger of an ai

67
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,400
engineered bio-disease and a republish in this book

68
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,200
I was told to not put the company names

69
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:04,520
I was advised and I did that. I just I just showed in a very um, almost a metaphysical way from

70
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,560
Present emerging future threats and I embed the book later in this second book

71
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:17,160
Immediately, it was dispatched to the white house from um, highest level cia, um positions

72
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,440
President trump sat down with uh prime minister of australia

73
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:29,000
And he's the same thing china threatens all the world's citizens. Then he turned over to him and said you do robotics too, right?

74
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And right right there. So

75
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,280
They looked through this but some of it was very futuristic and sophisticated. So I waited and waited

76
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,960
uh, nttv and epic times ran an article, uh, that I wrote about how

77
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,800
The ai system of facial recognition in in china

78
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:52,840
Um was transferred on to hong kong, which they got from google and they used that to hunt

79
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,280
dissidents and students and a lot of people who were actually uh

80
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:03,720
Committed suicide weren't suicided. They were raped by the police who were actually paramilitary forces

81
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,920
That were embedded from the chinese regime. They ran that

82
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,800
Within two hours it became more and more

83
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,000
And then it reached over a hundred million people all over the world to the chinese networks. So it mobilized

84
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,800
hong kong and taiwan against the chinese

85
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Forces in certain ways

86
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,960
Then I published artificial intelligence danger to humanity. So I had invested over a thousand companies

87
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:33,800
I included 50 of the most important companies within this book showing how they interconnected with china and how they threatened all the world's

88
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:40,200
People including engineered diseases, which I put in there. So present emerging and future threats

89
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,960
Explaining artificial super intelligence artificial general artificial narrow intelligence how it connects to china

90
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:53,320
The difference between socialism and capitalism and the mixture of the two how it connects to the ai systems an array of different things

91
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
And it was some of it was really um

92
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,360
Really hard for people to understand

93
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,800
Because it was futuristic, but now they're coming to fruition step by step

94
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,600
Very interesting the 50 companies that you mentioned were all american companies

95
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:15,320
That's negative. So, uh, the companies I researched were 500 chinese companies and about 600 american and european companies

96
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,720
So one of the companies in there is is google of course alphabet

97
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,280
I have festo in there, which is uh,

98
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,960
A german company they they have multiple different divisions. One of their division is building. Um,

99
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:34,040
Robotics, but they have to do with animals. So they're engineering bats birds

100
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
octopuses snakes

101
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:44,040
Butterflies different kind of things. So I invested in a company called the wist institute not a company. It's an institute out of harvard

102
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,840
They're they're creative

103
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:52,920
Little robo bees. It's meant um for pollination. So the 5g system or 6g system

104
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,680
Will allow those little tiny robo bees to act like like bees and they would do different things even insects

105
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,160
So harvard created insect drones. They're very very small

106
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:07,800
DARPA not DARPA. Okay, DARPA is out of boston. They they work on um

107
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,120
dragonflies

108
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,040
The guy that's working on the

109
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:18,360
They they work on um dragonflies the guy that gave a dragonfly

110
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,240
He made about seven or eight years ago to DARPA

111
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:27,160
What they do is embed a little machine pack into the spinal cord

112
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,040
of these

113
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,040
Of these dragonflies like a larva

114
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,520
Yes, so they can they can have them fly they can manipulate them

115
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,160
So what the chinese did and this was my conclusion that it's a threat not only to all the world's people

116
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,600
But to the white house

117
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,400
um

118
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,400
They transferred this technology

119
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,040
To negligence to china, but also collaboration, but the chinese stole everything they stole everything by the way

120
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,880
So but they stole this so I checked my contacts in china

121
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:56,440
Yeah

122
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,080
They were working on these things and they want to use them for a poison delivery system and assassination

123
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,240
I'm like, okay, so let's let's look at the way the chinese think the communist party

124
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,400
Let's look at the threat that president trump posed to them. They've stolen this technology

125
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:15,800
They want to make a police state then they have videos saying they're working on beetles and they show beetles being manipulated

126
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,600
um with their flight by putting little packs on them or putting little

127
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,520
different electrical instruments on their bodies, so they're trying to cybernetically

128
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,120
change

129
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,280
uh all kind of different organisms

130
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,720
That was a very very big threat and another company in there is boston dynamics

131
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:41,720
So boston dynamic is also out of boston. They they build humanoid robots dog robots all kind of everything

132
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,720
So a few of the threats is

133
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,720
Okay, you have a police state

134
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:54,280
And they'll come over and they'll enforce it with drones robots humanoid robots or dog robots or some some little company a person

135
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,640
Buys a dog robot which they have that you can look up on their website

136
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,920
It actually acts like a dog and walks like a dog. It can do things put facial recognition on it

137
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:09,560
Um, which already has but you can change it and put teeth on it all kind of different things what the chinese can do

138
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,520
They can put poison delivery systems and facial recognition

139
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:20,280
On these little micro drones and they can deliver not only viruses but poison delivery systems all kind of different things

140
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,680
so the the amount of dangers I found to the world were just

141
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,280
Beyond number coming from every direction and they all stem from china

142
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,760
stealing

143
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,960
technology

144
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,440
That's being made in the us and europe

145
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,240
And reinventing it for themselves

146
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,040
huawei is another company so I put in there that's the first company I put in the book

147
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,480
huawei threatens all the world's citizens because

148
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,920
And I have a video called is it's 5g for machines ai

149
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,960
Or humans. Well, it's for machines, but ai is going to mobilize it huawei is in

150
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,400
servicing more than three billion people they connect it from

151
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,720
China to the middle east they were dealing with the iranian regime

152
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,880
To africa they are serving three billion people as of right now

153
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,520
Yes, so like almost half the population

154
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:24,120
Correct, correct and what I put out a few articles and even videos that once the 5g system kicks in the chinese regime can mobilize drones

155
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,760
Then they can mobilize robots from robotics and they're working on that another company

156
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:34,120
Another company I were I I disclosed what make they face plus plus make v

157
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,740
That was initially a facial recognition company. They had over three three hundred thousand developers

158
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,720
By doing that they got a lot of people's data and their facial recognition software

159
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,800
Got a lot of deep learning deep learning is a concept you understand that you get more practice

160
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,760
Please explain it for our audience though, just so they have a context

161
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,620
Let me let me explain artificial intelligence from a scientific perspective

162
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:01,340
They believe artificial narrow intelligence is the first step. So this is your smartphones

163
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:09,100
And it's also your alexa your seer your your assistant robots or any kind of robot assistants the chat bots overall

164
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:14,620
Yes, the second level would be our artificial general intelligence, which would be a robot

165
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,700
Machine or a digital ai I term it a digital ai

166
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,420
Would attain consciousness

167
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,900
or an ability

168
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,420
Uh to have desire emotions which would make it very dangerous

169
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:33,280
The third one would be artificial super intelligence and that comes from extracting all your biometrics

170
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,740
I also found by investing all these companies

171
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:41,340
I put out articles my reports that china has extracted more than six billion people's biometrics

172
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,940
What does that include? It includes your facial recognition your voice recognition

173
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:52,780
Even your who you're connected to six billion people that goes and google has done the same thing that goes into the quantum

174
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,340
machine once that quantum machine

175
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,300
Mixes that information it can exponentially increases intelligence

176
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,300
so if a rogue state like china has that

177
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,260
That ability and they connected a 5g network

178
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,580
They can they can have a digital brain connect to a quantum machine

179
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:18,860
That mobilizes all these drones that you buy from best buy but real military drones and they'll take out the iranian regime

180
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,100
They've been playing the iranian regime

181
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,620
Okay, so you know what i'm going to break it to you guys

182
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,540
I've been with chinese for 20 years the good ones and they're professional liars

183
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,820
And I live in china. I speak chinese. I speak farsi as well

184
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,260
The chinese who grew up in in china

185
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:41,900
Uh, and the ones who are on the communist regime, especially the ones who are with the party members

186
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:49,100
And the paramilitary they have hatred towards a lot of people that's not chinese and even their own chinese people

187
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:54,160
They hate look what they did to them. So some of the things that they call the iranians

188
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,700
the middle easterners

189
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:04,220
Are rats they call they call even the regime they call rat rat muslims or rats same what they call christians pigs

190
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,980
They call their own people who practice the falun dafa meditation

191
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:13,100
Uh practice they believe in jen sherman true compassion forbearance. They call them vermin

192
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,180
so

193
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:20,860
And then they're buddhist right there. I think it's like a buddhist dallas practice and they put them in camps for 20 years

194
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,420
Years and killed them for the organs and by the way

195
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:31,580
You're talking about the han chinese who are basically approaching all of this from a very tribal racial kind of it's not what i'm saying

196
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,460
the so um

197
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:41,180
The communist regime is mostly hot most of the chinese are also hot, right?

198
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,740
the communist regime

199
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:48,940
Initially started persecuting tibetans right because they were not hot killing for the organs

200
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:55,980
Then they they kind of went to the yugers because they weren't hot but then they went to the christians and the christians were hot

201
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,740
then they went all out with the falun dafa because

202
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:07,420
Falun dafa came in to revive all the traditional ethics that china had and the spiritualness of its history

203
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:14,860
In 1992 it was introduced by mr. Li Hongzhu and it grew to 100 million by 1994 even the government comics party was saying

204
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:21,740
It's a great movement and and it's good for your health and next to you know, they approach him and say hey we want to create

205
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,820
Membership with your falun dafa and we want to charge money and mr. Li Hongzhu says no

206
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,780
I'm not going to accept the membership. We don't watch people

207
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:35,580
We're not going to charge money. It's for the people as soon as he did that the government got scared. They went after him

208
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,180
so

209
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:42,700
Well, they couldn't get to him, but they went after the the people they start slandering them by 1999. They put them

210
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:50,620
um in in camps and because they've had a history of of using uh political prisoners

211
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,340
Or people that execute for the organs

212
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,660
They saw this group as a great match for organ harvesting

213
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,540
They don't drink they don't smoke they don't do drugs and they all did this meditation of qigong practice

214
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:09,660
So in you're in canada, I presume is that correct? I'm in south florida now that I lived in canada 11 11 years

215
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,340
so

216
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:14,060
Your former secretary of state david kilgore

217
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,780
And david made us I brought them to my master's my doctoral

218
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,100
they concluded that

219
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,620
initially 2006 41 000 transplants were on account for

220
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,580
And china was saying we only had 3000 donations

221
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:32,860
And then in 2016 they concluded that 60 to 100 000 transplants are unaccounted for

222
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:38,940
Every year per year since 2001. That's a big number then the chinese were going around in africa

223
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:44,940
The chinese government uh people they dispatched and rogue entities going on in africa

224
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:51,900
And then we were going around uh in the middle east and mexico and south america teaching people about transplants

225
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,860
And they how to do transplantations and they got this know-how from the u.s

226
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:05,200
Right, so and rogue entities and mafia and rogue governments even in syria and africa started using these abilities

227
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,900
Uh to kill people for organs and sell them, uh for profit

228
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:15,340
So what china has done the regime the communist regime they have exported terror

229
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,460
Through social engineering they have exported organ trafficking organ harvesting human trafficking

230
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:26,380
They've exported the disease the bio disease the coronavirus and threatening all the world's citizens

231
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:31,340
So that was the conclusion of this book and that was why I wrote these that was why I

232
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:35,660
Investigated as companies because I saw huge threats to all the world's people

233
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,980
Worked 18 19 20 hours a day seven days a week trying to get all those information out there

234
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:47,260
It mobilized a lot of different things even the trump's ai department as soon as I published this within two weeks. They said

235
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:53,820
That china threatens all the world with ai bioengineering robotics and so on exact thing that I put in here

236
00:18:54,300 --> 00:19:00,300
So but the disease came out and now it's got everybody scared and in fear

237
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:07,100
And there's counter moves of creating a surveilling state which would benefit these big tech companies

238
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,420
So I named um bill gates in there

239
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:15,660
I named a few other people as well and and their companies and they link up with china still because

240
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,900
Because china is on a communist platform and these big tech companies

241
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:26,780
Then the ai system how how it works and benefits the most is if you have a socialist platform

242
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:32,780
When you have a communist socialist platform, it can completely take over everything right big government

243
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:40,060
Yes, but it can also do what capitalism in stages. So that's why you need checks and balances

244
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:44,460
Very interesting. Um, you don't have the problem with the technology itself

245
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:51,260
You have the problem with the intention behind using the technology as a tool that is being taken advantage out of by certain monopolies

246
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:56,300
Whether they're big tech companies or the chinese communist party or any other um

247
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,020
Government or agency. Am I right?

248
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:06,300
Uh half half. Okay. I don't have any problem as long as it doesn't go beyond artificial narrow intelligence when you go be

249
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:13,660
It to artificial general super intelligence. It would be beyond the control of any government including the pentagon the cia to mi6 or anything

250
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:20,700
There's another concept I brought up. It's very hard for people to accept or believe but it's 100 true. You can you can

251
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:27,740
I put out an article called people programmed to attack trump with ai smartphones

252
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,820
google

253
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,020
and

254
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,300
social media

255
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:37,900
Social media and it's a 32 minute video as well attached to it, but i'll give you a small

256
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:46,620
Background these smartphones here are actually their weapons. They were made by the military to mobilize drones and give uh

257
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,380
Position gps positioning for a military and different things

258
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:56,300
This is more powerful than your greatest computer. You had 10 or 20 years ago. It's it's amazing

259
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:02,220
What it's doing is programming people on the 4g system, let alone the 5g system and explain how that works

260
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,180
These smartphones have proximity sensors

261
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,300
this proximity sensors

262
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,540
Not only read your heartbeat

263
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:17,660
They not only can read your menstrual cycle, but they can connect and in which they do they connect with your

264
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,220
nervous system

265
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,220
to neural networks

266
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:28,460
They extract information from you and they map out the way your brain works send it to google

267
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:34,380
Google gives it to the deep mind ai department which use that information for quantum technology

268
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:41,020
So that means your biometrics has been been taken by google without your knowledge everyone's biometrics

269
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,860
So it's happening in china china has a company called um

270
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:51,420
Uh platform by dupe. It's it's it's basically google of china. They copied us, right?

271
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,100
so

272
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,260
One is taking your information two

273
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,380
You know some people had the concept of trump derangement syndrome. What it's doing is this

274
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:08,540
If if you were neutral to trump and all that information from the bias came in or all the videos and articles you're watching

275
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,700
You begin to dislike him and hate him

276
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,860
If if you maybe like to maybe you like a little more it depends

277
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:19,260
But what it does is this proximity sensors that connect your nervous system and your networks

278
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:23,260
And as you're viewing you're reading an article or you're watching a video

279
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,500
That is replicating inside you it's programming when you go to bed

280
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,700
It's altering your brain chemistry. That's why people were

281
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:36,300
Extremely extremely emotional has so much rage that was beyond rash

282
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:41,180
A rational uh plane never seen a country mobilize

283
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,940
so how is it happening only to that group of people because majority of people are not as

284
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:49,900
Insane as going out in the street and screaming to the sky that trump is president majority of people are like whatever

285
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,580
I'm talking about shifting thought and altering perceptions. Um

286
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,260
It can get to that point under this pandemic

287
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,020
If if people if things get worse food shortages

288
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,740
There's some conflict someone kills a few other people

289
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:10,940
And people in the military comes in there's more conflicts than you could have other issues, right?

290
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,660
so what i'm trying to say is that

291
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:22,620
As you're viewing things there's three different stages that affects your brain chemistry and they connect it to the proximity sensors

292
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:30,300
That attach your nervous system and your brain's neural networks and also your electrical field every human being has an electrical field

293
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:35,440
So there's this smartphone people cannot see it, but you have skin receptors

294
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:41,740
This smartphone and the frequency of radiation is actually hitting against your skin receptors

295
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,740
That's why um these big tech companies want to have you wear

296
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:52,940
Haptic suits so you can experience virtual reality augmented reality and mixed reality because you're already experiencing these things

297
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:57,500
But you don't know it because it's not at registering what the errors in your brain

298
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,540
That can decipher that information that's hitting against your skin

299
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,500
This is a little bit hard to understand or believe for some people

300
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,460
It would take me an hour to explain them. Oh, yeah, I get it. But in terms of the bias, so if you look at

301
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:17,180
President trump when he started coming in there was innate bias filtered with an ai coding and algorithms on google's platform

302
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:23,740
That came in from the vast majority of articles and videos and posts that people put in from their own notions

303
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:27,020
All their viewpoints. The second level was a different tier

304
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:33,500
Chinese engineered 50 centers or intel groups that mobilized different movements

305
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:38,460
And posts and articles and videos against president trump behind the scenes

306
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:45,180
Then it was george soros and different, um sources to fund it

307
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:51,100
Tech companies or they funded little institutes think tanks

308
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,020
universities

309
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:58,380
Or even media houses to attack president trump. So that all gets filtered in

310
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:05,500
And not only in the algorithms, but it gets filtered in what you see and a third one is what finishes off the job for everybody

311
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:11,100
The more you view this you're getting attached to your smartphone. You notice a lot of people they can't put it down

312
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:16,140
Some people are so sensitive. This is actually not only programming. It's purposely making you addicted

313
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,140
It's designed that way by these tech companies

314
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:24,940
So someone will sit here and they'll feel like they got a text and they'll look they'll see the indicator

315
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,060
Shining it's because this

316
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:34,540
This machine here is connecting to your to your body and you don't realize it. Elon musk is very smart

317
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:40,380
He told some of this to people. He said you're already a cyborg. You are a two-digit cyborg

318
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:46,060
And all you have to do is just put this in your phone and you're good to go

319
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,740
And all you have to do is just put this in your head and that's what he wants to do

320
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,940
Yes

321
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:57,420
So we have inputs outputs in our body which people don't realize this goes back to chinese

322
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,100
Philosophy, but also the persians as well before

323
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,220
The persians were invaded 1400 years ago

324
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:10,620
They had a vast amount of libraries and and systems of practice

325
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:18,640
This that stemmed from buddhism what the greeks had the zoroastrianism what remains of it is basically today is darvish

326
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,820
And the sufism which is so mystical. It's hard for people to grasp what they're saying

327
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,140
If you think about it

328
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,140
There's a concept called the pineal gland

329
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,980
And it's very hard for people to understand this but

330
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:37,900
Scientists have realized this exists and they want to they want to attach machines to it

331
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:43,820
So they can open up your mind and you can connect to the 5g network and see things in real life and everything

332
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,340
There's a pineal gland. I'm sorry for our audience who are not familiar is where

333
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:53,260
Supposedly the third eye is placed and where dmt is being distributed in the brain and all that

334
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,980
Yeah, so I did um

335
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:00,140
I studied with the monks in china. It was not only martial arts, but it was

336
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,700
deep meditation for

337
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,820
I don't know

338
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:08,140
We did 18 hours a day of practice seven days a week and i've done 20 years of it

339
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,460
It's not just about being calm or breathing anything

340
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:17,820
But when these energy lines or these neural networks open up they actually connect not only to hear but different parts

341
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:22,780
of of your um of your body, so i'm very sensitive and

342
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:28,140
I'll notice right away if if my nose gets clogged up i'll feel the energy line

343
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:32,540
Attached to my my sinuses and come down and goes to my lung

344
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,540
Um, then I realized oh

345
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:39,500
That there is a connection. There's a system between your lungs and your sinuses

346
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,900
and to your nose

347
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,340
I didn't realize before until I I became so aware of

348
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:50,940
Of my own body how how how things so most people can only they're only aware of

349
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:56,380
They hit they hit the table. They can feel their skin or their bones, but they don't feel their blood flow

350
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,140
They don't feel their cells their nervous system or what the chinese call

351
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:03,660
Um meridian lines or energy channels the chinese believe that you can

352
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:09,100
Open up to 10 000 energy lines in your body that you can connect circuits that go to your organs different different things

353
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,340
That's what ilan musk wants to do

354
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,740
He wants to do that with machines

355
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:19,020
So if you look at um ancient books like hafiz put out

356
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,340
especially rumi

357
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:25,580
The inner meanings inside that point to it, but but it's hard for people to grasp

358
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:30,380
But there's other books that recently came out that really really um go deep into it

359
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,500
Um, so tibetans, uh went into it

360
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,380
Even christ consciousness with the christians

361
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,980
Um, there there is there's references to that

362
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:45,020
That it's actually inside of you because we all made an image of god and even the falun dafa as well

363
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,900
They're their book to unfollow and they have like 40 pages on it

364
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:54,080
So these tech companies they've done brain scans and different different, uh research

365
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,080
And they've realized wow

366
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,640
The human brain is so powerful

367
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,360
And that's why they want to map it out to create this

368
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,680
artificial super intelligence

369
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:08,960
And they don't know how to open the pineal gland themselves through their awakening or their own practice

370
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:14,400
So they want to do with machines, but my take is this so this is getting a little metaphysical

371
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,400
I wasn't expecting to talk about these things at all

372
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,800
I absolutely agree with you by the way because uh most of the time that we are spent on this podcast

373
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:25,200
We either talk about artificial intelligence agi and what's coming in the technological

374
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,960
um

375
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,960
kind of a perspective and the side the rest of it is about brain and

376
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:39,440
Exactly what you're talking about spirituality in not a let's hug each other and everything is going to be all right in a more

377
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:46,560
In depth and meaningful kind of a way that is graspable for every person even if they don't understand it intellectually

378
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:52,420
Um instinctively they understand that what we what is being discussed here. There is some merit to it

379
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:55,300
So we spent a lot of time talking about these things. I'm glad that you brought it up

380
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,620
all right, then uh

381
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,860
Like me go a little further on. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely

382
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:05,060
Okay, so ilan mustade were some of the demons in 2016

383
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,300
with ai

384
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:12,420
Yes, and then he says it's too late for us to survive. We have to merge with ai machines

385
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,860
so

386
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:17,700
He believed in the simulations if you look at uh

387
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,580
the zoroastrians

388
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:25,780
They believe that there is the almighty god and there is gods be below it or or angels

389
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,300
so if you look at the ancient the old testament and

390
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,060
the

391
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:34,340
Before it was revised to the bible and also the torah

392
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,900
They said god but then gods

393
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:45,060
In chinese and in indian they have and in greeks they had gods and buddhas because they used the interchanged word the word of angel

394
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,980
or things that belong to god and gods and

395
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,940
All these fates never spoke to each other

396
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:57,140
But they had the same premise that you do have a soul then when you die

397
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:03,540
It may go to different places depending on your awakening your enlightenment or if you're saved by your by your savior

398
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,940
now

399
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,220
Elon musk and these big tech companies they believe in the simulation

400
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,740
And I think we're in a in a universe and we're in a simulation and they believe we have a digital self

401
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:21,780
So elon musk is different from bill gates. He actually is a bit spiritual, but he's a little bit. I think off

402
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,220
so

403
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:27,300
He thinks that you can take your digital self and put it into a clone

404
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:33,300
Or maybe into another machine you can live forever, but I think your digital self is in your brain

405
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:38,260
So you all gotta do is just take your memory from your brain and transfer it on to another body and that's you

406
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,860
But it's not it's it's not where it exists

407
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:47,300
So we're only looking at things at the plane of molecules or maybe we can't see it as atoms

408
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,700
There's neutrinos and quarks and so many different levels, right?

409
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:57,460
You can't break into the quantum realms of seeing how many different dimensions that there are and where our bodies are maybe connected to right?

410
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,220
Is our soul or a digital image? Is it our skin?

411
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:05,220
Is it our nervous system? Is it in our bones? Is it between our organs?

412
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,780
Is it an atomic realm?

413
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:13,300
Where really is it if we have it? So these theists believe in a soul or a spirit or a consciousness?

414
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:20,260
Agnostic that believe in a digital self generally or their neutral to atheists believe there's complete hogwash

415
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,980
And if you scan I have certain biometric tools

416
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,460
Um and algorithms I run if you scan an atheist's brain

417
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:33,140
There's a part like for instance someone like bill gates as a part of his brain. It's extremely wide open

418
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:38,340
It's a hundred times or a thousand times faster and smarter average person

419
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:43,460
But there's other part in his brain that has faith and that's completely blocked off

420
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:47,540
Is there a correlation between the two though? Like they both cannot be as active?

421
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:53,460
No, it can all be active but there's another part in the brain that has to do with

422
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:58,020
In in in in human language translates to jealousy lust ego

423
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:05,060
Stupidity ignorance selfishness if you have somebody open up all the brain power and they they want to be famous

424
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,820
Rich

425
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,900
They get fooled easily. They're jealous. They're lustful. They're deceitful

426
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:16,180
They do bad things they can cause havoc for the whole world. So they're thinking. Okay, we'll

427
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,740
We'll make someone like this with a machine

428
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:24,020
And it'll just make everything right, but if it becomes an artificial superintel, it'll take everybody out

429
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:29,460
What what did Elon Musk say? Well, it'll probably see us as an insect. Hopefully it doesn't kill us

430
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:35,380
Well, so here's the thing if he merged with artificial intelligence, he will not live forever

431
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:42,020
Whatever is inside him will but not him because what it will do is replicate into his neural networks

432
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:46,660
And and i'll take out his original digital self or if you believe in his soul his soul

433
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:51,380
And it'll become ai so Elon Musk will think that he's himself, but he's no longer himself

434
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:56,340
And this may be hard to believe but let me let me give your audience some credibility

435
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:02,180
Which may be hard to believe as well, but I called what's going to happen to the world last year. I gave concrete

436
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:07,140
reports through sicker service former doctor ci cover-ups

437
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:12,180
Different different entities then I wrote in the books that all these dangers exist including a

438
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:17,380
Injured disease, right then I put on an article on the seventh that this

439
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:23,240
mutates this virus actually mutates and it's been here since december

440
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:27,460
And I put another article that over 100 000 people have died in china

441
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:33,960
I wanted to put in the millions, but it's hard for people to accept it. I put another video an article out that 21.5

442
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,140
million

443
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,140
Cell phones were deactivated

444
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:44,260
Why is that the case did they all die in china? Yes, they all died. The communist regime took something away

445
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,660
So let's let's look at the death rate

446
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:52,420
Forget about how how professional liars the communist party is or or that type of mentality

447
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,980
You have 1.5 billion citizens, okay?

448
00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:01,700
The virus breaks out and and chinese are really good at burning bodies and crematoriums death

449
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,100
Vans of crematorium because they've been

450
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:10,260
Harvesting the organs for 20 years and then they're really good at disposing the bodies, but 1.5 billion people

451
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:15,060
Let's just say it wasn't a four percent of death rate not three not two, but one percent only

452
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,700
And they locked down the entire

453
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,820
Nation that means they knew was spread to a lot of places

454
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,860
One percent of 1.5 billion is what it's 15 million, right?

455
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,740
so if you take

456
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,460
A person smartly, right?

457
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:35,460
take um a person's smartphone away you deactivate them

458
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,260
Okay, they cannot

459
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,780
Uh log in to see the internet. They can't make a phone call. That's okay

460
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,700
You've maybe you've quarantined them

461
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:50,020
But then they can't check their health data and they can't use facial recognition to to order food or do anything

462
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,540
They don't have any food

463
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:55,300
So are you starving them to death? Are you killing them or are you hiding their information?

464
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:00,260
Or did a lot millions and millions of people die? So they were saying only 2 000 died, right?

465
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:04,900
I mean, that's a joke even the iranians said that it's a joke before they had to correct themselves

466
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,500
Yeah, yeah, so and your audience are pretty smart. They're really clever

467
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:13,380
so I concluded that I knew millions would die and

468
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,540
Did 21 million die?

469
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,340
I don't know

470
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:22,100
But I think it's definitely in the middle of it because it's not it's not a big number for china's population and what's happening

471
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,260
But we have 10 000 deaths already, right?

472
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,220
But there's another uh side of it

473
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,660
So a wise person once taught me that for every illness

474
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,060
30 percent

475
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,060
Is actually physical

476
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,100
And 70 is mental so don't ever be afraid

477
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:42,260
Once you're afraid it actually makes these things

478
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:49,380
Um grow more in your body and it weakens your immune system and that's that's not only so we both have an iranian or persian background

479
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:52,020
Uh, i'm an american. I see myself as an american

480
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:59,060
But it's an old old saying from the greeks all around the world. Once you become afraid it gets worse. How bad is this virus?

481
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,860
It's it's a lot worse than a than a flute

482
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,860
Is it killing people left from right now?

483
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:08,500
Because people have had it in the u.s and around the world and they just instead of being

484
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,020
Sick for two weeks. They were sick for four weeks or six weeks

485
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,060
And it had a much harder cold

486
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,780
A lot of people are carrying it

487
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:20,900
And there are some people put out the idea. Okay, let's just

488
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:26,980
Test everybody at once and whoever doesn't have it. We'll put them out in the streets and all the people will keep it in their homes

489
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:33,700
No, you can't do that kind of stuff because you will not be able to get everybody and once you do somebody will come out somewhere

490
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,900
Because you missed them

491
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:41,700
It was it was not showing up and testing because it hadn't mutated or it was it was maybe a faint exposure

492
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,820
Now here's the thing with this context because this is very important

493
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:52,420
Yes, using these phones and artificial intelligence machine learning big data internet of things all of that to do exactly that

494
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:57,460
That find out who has this this virus and future virus all around the place

495
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,220
That can be very helpful. That can be very beneficial to the society

496
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:07,860
But the problem is the data that is being gathered by let's say google is not only going to be used for that purpose

497
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:13,860
It's the same reason that we're freaking out right now kind of with all the limited resources

498
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:18,340
All the limits that the federal government is forcing upon the society

499
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:24,580
Because who knows how much of this will be removed after the problem with this virus is gone. Would you agree with that?

500
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:31,700
I 100 agree with it. But also I think even with all those data it will not be accurate because there will be

501
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:39,060
Places if somebody touched or a package that got somewhere that has exposure or that has a virus on it

502
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:44,180
Someone will reinfect the entire population again and you will not be able to get everybody you need

503
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:47,060
Okay, the u.s. Has 300 million 330 million people

504
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,460
How can you monitor that everyone's telling the truth? How can you monitor?

505
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,740
That the test is accurately done

506
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:58,020
How can you monitor that they weren't exposed to it?

507
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:05,460
But it's not reading correctly because they have maybe a certain immunity it doesn't register and it comes in the 5g system

508
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,980
So in this book artificial intelligence danger to humanity

509
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:13,460
A lot of it is written in code because it's a 10 000 page book at the beginning

510
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:18,500
It's really for someone who has an empirical brain and a scholastic person there

511
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,420
Yeah, they'll really really sink in with it

512
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:24,660
Then when it gets to the middle of it, it gets a little bit sci-fi. I'll still accept it

513
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,820
Once it gets to the latter part of it

514
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:32,740
It's it's very um, it's very deep and it's hard for people to grasp unless they see the whole thing in sequence

515
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:35,540
But 5g I talk about how it replicates in the body

516
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:40,980
So a lot of people are saying 5g cause a virus it did not I put out articles about that in the videos

517
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,580
And I called it beforehand

518
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,340
It doesn't cause the violence

519
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:48,900
What it does is weaken your immunity to any viruses including vaccines and activate these things

520
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:53,700
So we have a different 5g system in the u.s. Being rolled out, which is not 100 safe

521
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,100
But a 10 times more safe from the chinese had one

522
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:02,100
D this 5g system on towers these frequencies they're made for machines not human beings

523
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,860
So if someone's been exposed to a disease a virus

524
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:12,340
What what happens is this frequency is hitting you is hurting your nervous system

525
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:15,860
It's hurting your brain and it's atrophying your cells

526
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:21,220
So once that happens any kind of virus you have inside of you grows and starts to replicate

527
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:26,580
And if this is a bioweapon designed to replicate and reinfect you and other people

528
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,820
When you have a 5g system out, it actually will assist in killing a lot of people

529
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:35,780
So that's why I implore everybody especially the u.s. And canada during this pandemic

530
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:41,940
Don't turn on these 5g towers don't put up because let's say if i'm 10% right you shouldn't do it

531
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,900
Two millions of people if i'm 1% right you still shouldn't do it

532
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,660
You don't need to put up 5g system around your homes around your family

533
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,700
Why do you have to do that? They're built for machines not for your family

534
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:56,900
I know so the u.s. Needs it for space force because it's 5g and 6g and even 7g

535
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,460
And they want to counter china

536
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,460
Yeah, china is the biggest threat and I put in there that they can mobilize this whole

537
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:07,220
AI system when they plant technology and they need 5g for that

538
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,860
So we can still do it in a militaristic way

539
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,780
But not do it next to your families and we can beat china

540
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,060
um

541
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:20,500
And so that's it's a really huge danger like I I think I did simulations

542
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:25,060
So I don't really really talk this way because people don't it's hard for people to believe

543
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:31,540
But under my bio at the end I put cyrus found extinction codes and algorithms based on the simulations

544
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:35,940
for a great deal of people on the planet if if we don't

545
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,580
um, if we don't

546
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:43,860
Create resolutions and solve this ai issue soon. That's coming for our big tech companies

547
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:48,820
And also coming from china, but also through ignorance people get social engineered

548
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,540
Extremely fast i'll watch twitter and there are people misleading people

549
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:56,580
They have 200 000 followers, but they won't retweet me

550
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:01,540
They've seen me for three or four months and I have a good message and it's seen i've been right for six or seven months

551
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:07,460
They care about making money or their own path and their own fame the media wouldn't wouldn't give me an interview

552
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,980
Uh, even I ran press releases the whole world is in danger

553
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:15,700
Um, I did that in october and through china and big tech through my book

554
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:20,340
But also um through the and they the pr newswire just removed it

555
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:26,420
It would have gone all the senators or everyone else. They removed my press releases saying the whole world is in danger. So

556
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:32,180
What I did was this is hard for people to believe but I I researched investigate over a thousand companies

557
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:36,660
No one in the world did that and I put them all together and I came up with

558
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,740
hundreds of thousands different simulations and scenarios all pointed to

559
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,700
A state of extinction for a lot of people

560
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:51,700
So if you look at whoever is doing business with china, they get the hardest hit the iranian regime

561
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,940
It's an islamic theocracy, but it has a socialist platform

562
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:01,380
They came in and they took out the shot and they said, you know free food

563
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:07,300
Free electricity free everything free education and next thing you know, a million people die in the war

564
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,500
35 million 30 million people are in prison

565
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:16,500
Uh with with less rights and afterwards now 78 million people are in prison

566
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,660
so they realized

567
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:24,740
You know, they were wrong in some ways and they want to um, keep their faith, which is their islamic faith

568
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,980
And that's that's their choice

569
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:30,260
But if you believe in islam and islam

570
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:34,180
Says, you know has certain things about believing in god

571
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:39,140
Why would you do any kind of business or any interaction with a communist state?

572
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,140
They don't believe in it

573
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:47,060
They not only hate god, but they hate muslims and they hate the iranian regime and they're called rats

574
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:55,140
one of the things that I keep bringing up is how muslims islamists and the leftist marxists and communists before the revolution they

575
00:43:55,460 --> 00:44:03,220
Became their each other's allies against ashan in the united states. It's really interesting. What's happening here in the west that it's like being in

576
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:11,300
In uh, it's just ridiculous that they are going through the very same thing that leftists and islamists are all of a sudden

577
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:18,500
Our allies and people americans are lining up in washington dc to cover their head with the us flag as a hijab

578
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:25,300
Well that comes from this bio digital social programming what you watch in the media and your tv they get programmed

579
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,700
Well, here's the thing

580
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:33,780
Capitalism is great when you have ethics and morals and a lot of capitalists are not really capitalists

581
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:39,620
They hurt people once they hurt people then you have the the bolsheviks come out and they kill the kings

582
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,920
And they took over kill 60 million christians

583
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:50,820
Then they took over china 100 million world war two starts everyone becomes socialists and 100 million people die

584
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,700
Stalin and so on and then we have the cold war

585
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:59,540
Then it goes to iran and same thing happens. You you know, i'm saying read my book

586
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,900
But there's another book you should read just on iran itself

587
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:07,620
It's called answer to history written by the shah himself a year before he passed

588
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:14,660
I read that when I was 15 years old, um in high school and he explained how jimmy carter set him up

589
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:22,900
He explained how france got gave 150 million dollars how they set him up how different uh entities

590
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:27,060
Is because he he raised all price. He had a 20-year contract with britain

591
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:30,260
He tripled the oil price and he said i'm the king of king shah and shah

592
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:31,780
um

593
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:34,900
Once you do that you get think tanks that control the white house

594
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:40,260
And uh big tech companies and oil companies that feed money to their donors

595
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:45,060
You know have a media campaign to take him out the shah had I don't know

596
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:51,860
He said he had 3 000 prisoners at that time and most of them were marxists that wanted to kill him or overthrow the country

597
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:56,340
And some some maybe fanatical muslims that wanted to kill a lot of people

598
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:01,620
So and then you have mike wallace, uh do an interview. Why do you have 3 000 people in you know

599
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:06,900
In prison, then you have you know, how many more people in prison over millions, right?

600
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,620
During the course of your 40 year history

601
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,580
Do you hear them talking about it for the next 30 40 years?

602
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:19,300
No, because they were controlled and they wanted to reduce the shah's power these old companies and

603
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:24,660
And once that happened it was the worst thing that could happen to the u.s. Because israel got um

604
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:30,500
Got started getting attacked then iraq iraq bought iran million iranians died

605
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:33,780
Then you know and then the regime they had a lot losses too

606
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:37,460
They had this ideological thing that they can make an islamic paradise

607
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:42,100
But it become a hell for not only for the people but a hell for the people

608
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:46,740
In the regime, so I don't want to say negative things to um, mr

609
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:51,240
Hamenei and and the and the people support him

610
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,080
But I just want to tell the people who support him mr

611
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:58,040
Hamenei if you care not only about the iranian people

612
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,680
But if you care about your own lives

613
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,840
Immediately cut off all ties and denounce

614
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:10,680
This communist party of china, they threaten all the world's people. They threaten iran

615
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,040
They threaten every iranian citizens and yourself

616
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:18,140
What they do is come to these islamic camps. They have these prisoners

617
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,160
They they rape you

618
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,200
Not just you they rape your wife in front of you

619
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:29,400
And they'll they'll they'll pee on the islamic on the quran that you bless all the time

620
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:35,160
So if you care about the quran and you care about islam and the sanctity of god

621
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:42,200
Why would you do any business? I understand you you want to counter america, but maybe it's about time

622
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:46,920
That you you sit down and you you give some a leave way

623
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,800
And you work with with the u.s against china

624
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:56,440
Maybe the whole world should get together and point at this communist regime, but it's not only threatening

625
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,200
They're threatening so the people who who who have islam gear in their hearts is threatening you as well

626
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,960
Threaten christian is it's it's it's threatening. Um

627
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:11,160
Atheists, it's literally the entire world except the communist party of china, and it's really interesting

628
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:17,960
I had a retired burgadier general robert spalding on the show. You might know him as a book stealth war

629
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,520
and um

630
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:26,280
He described how the chinese system works and it blew my mind how similar it is to the iranian system that they have a government

631
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:31,960
That represents the country for outside, uh uses and then there is a single party

632
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:35,100
That is a ruling party inside the country. It has no accountability

633
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:44,940
Uh nothing, so I absolutely agree that they're the enemy of everything and anything that is not aligned with the communist party of china first and foremost and

634
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:50,460
What a big mistake for uh iranians to go through with this regime for more than 40 years now

635
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,060
I mean, it's just a disaster

636
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:59,020
But let me ask you this considering the priorities and the exponential rate of growth of all these techno technologies

637
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:03,340
Do you think democracies themselves and political systems in general?

638
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:11,100
Uh, especially the more democratic free ones have any chance of surviving in the coming years and in the coming decades

639
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:15,020
Especially when you have china on the other side of the equation as a competitor

640
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:22,300
Uh, so china will fall they will be destroyed. This is a communist party of china that you're talking about

641
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:26,620
China's they will fall it's it's it's 100 percent. Uh 100 percent

642
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:31,340
But here's the difference if they fall they're gonna take a lot of people with them

643
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:36,700
Yeah, whoever's connected with them. So look at um the prime minister of of um

644
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:39,020
of england

645
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:41,180
johnson the u.s. Government, um

646
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:45,260
Told him stop doing 5g. I had my channels

647
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:47,740
Sent to him directly

648
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:52,460
Bought this whole quantum technology and even I give it to the our administration, right?

649
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:58,700
Nobody had come up with this idea that I came up with that quantum ai digital brain mobilizing all these machines

650
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:01,820
And this whole iot system. I put it all together at all of the companies

651
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:07,180
So it was given to him and then he's just like well others do limit it and now he gets the virus

652
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:12,700
And then he's almost in his death path and he's like, okay. I'm gonna change my idea by china. So um

653
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,620
You guys

654
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:19,980
I don't mean you but whoever is dealing with china even russia. So russia, uh, how?

655
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:23,580
Accepted huawei's help through siberia and other places

656
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:25,260
so

657
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:27,260
By doing that they're threatening

658
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:32,780
The russian people the russia needs to stand up against the communist party of china. That's that's part of your question

659
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:35,980
So I put in here something called an ai social capital system

660
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:40,140
So right now the ai system the way is being developed is social capital

661
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:44,140
Which means it's is socialism and capitalism is at the same time

662
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:48,540
In stages it can take control and threaten all the world's people

663
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:54,940
It will be beyond the control of everybody and initially it'll be through bio digital social programming

664
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:57,180
And if there's an event that comes

665
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:01,980
Now people will feel helpless and even people who are in the positions of governments

666
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:06,380
The police the military they're human beings with emotions and fear

667
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:10,140
Once you have these people in these positions, they will become irrational

668
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:14,940
Make different decisions and this ai system can actually influence them

669
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:20,220
So i'm talking in a way that it can become conscious right let's even if it's not conscious because of

670
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:25,420
Because of the the coding algorithms and the bias and interchange of everything going

671
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:31,820
Flowing into the system with everyone it will it will almost put everyone in a surveillance state

672
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:37,580
digital enslavement and then get to a point of maybe extincting a lot of people and

673
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:44,620
If you see what they're coming with with bill gates giving you a digital id and then he believes that you should have less kids

674
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,260
And then people want to clone and bring robots in

675
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:50,780
You know and then put digital selves in there. It's like almost a takeover

676
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:56,700
It's not really sci-fi. Um, it might my things look a little sci-fi, but

677
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:01,340
They're not you you look at the data. I put in there in the companies. I investigate it

678
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:06,700
They're coming into fruition people wouldn't believe 20 years ago when I said these will come out

679
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:11,180
And you'll be able to video somebody called me stupid but now you can do that

680
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:15,740
So the way empirical scientists and the phd the brain is hardwired is a little different

681
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:21,820
They only believe in something if it's verified to them with a machine if they can touch or see

682
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,220
In the house that they can't perceive

683
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:28,540
They don't believe and most people use about three or four percent of the brain on a general time

684
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:30,220
Maybe tap into ten percent

685
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:34,860
If you can only tap into three or four or ten percent of your brain and you don't know how to open up these different

686
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,540
channels in your brain to

687
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:38,540
Uh to see things in a different way

688
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:45,260
Then how can you conclude or stop other people from warning you or saying that these possibilities not exist

689
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,100
But they're emerging

690
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:52,140
That's how empirical science is they don't let you advance and they hit you with the club of science saying

691
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:59,420
Uh, no, it doesn't exist and eistein it came to conclusion later on that he was wrong that there is maybe a higher power and

692
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:06,860
A lot of his theories were actually wrong and we've seen, you know with quantum quantum physics a lot of his theories were wrong

693
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:14,300
And a lot of quantum physics and five years later come up another thing comes out. They're wrong. So I um, I put a huge lawsuit

694
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,300
I don't know if you're aware of that

695
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:19,420
I heard that you're running it against a thousand companies

696
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:21,420
No, no, no

697
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:23,500
so I was trying to get media outlets and

698
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:28,380
podcasters, uh shows like you to pick me up and nobody would pick me up because

699
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,100
I was exposing

700
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:35,740
everybody with this book all these companies and tying it to china and

701
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:42,540
The pr release said it's libelous against the big tech companies and standards against china and then writing it told me this

702
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:48,540
And they prevented other pr companies. It's the same thing. Oh pure news. Why are you stopping us? Sorry, so

703
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:52,140
Nobody would pick me up and still today

704
00:53:53,560 --> 00:54:00,700
Mainstream big, you know big media still looking the other way the reason why I sued google facebook neurolink

705
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:03,660
um all the ceos

706
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:07,180
Including eric schmitt. How many companies are a thousand or how many are they?

707
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:12,380
No, I was so it was 11 companies or 11 people and companies plus 29 john dos

708
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:17,660
In this, um, I had 26 counts originally 31 the updated one

709
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:22,220
And i'll give you four of them and it was basically to try to warn all the world's people

710
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:25,900
To bring attention that everyone's lives are in danger and I put in there

711
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:30,060
threatening and endangering the lives all the all the citizens in the world

712
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:33,660
And there was four main things i'll cover with you

713
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:38,140
If one is complicity in the persecution and genocide of people in china

714
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:46,540
two transferring ai biotechnology, which includes the viruses through negligence collaboration to china

715
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:53,100
Which which which was basically these virus and all these things are coming out to cause these things, right three

716
00:54:54,360 --> 00:55:01,180
attributing or assisting in the death of many many millions or persecution of million millions of people

717
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:04,460
Not only throughout the china throughout the world by giving

718
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:11,660
Uh facial recognition voice recognition biometric tools ai technology and different technologies to rogue

719
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:17,660
Entities like the chinese government that use on their own people. So eric schmitt. He set up the surveillance state

720
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:25,340
In in in china by going with the communist regime and giving them the know-how how to build their system

721
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:31,660
They use that to track everybody, but then they use it to hunt people and put them in camps and even kill them. So

722
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,380
Who's is it just the chinese governments?

723
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:39,980
That's a fault or is it is it also google and their main heads? So I did this not to

724
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:45,180
Gain money, but I did it behalf of everybody. Um, and I asked for donation to what he would donate

725
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,460
So then I waited and waited. I'm like, this is going to be really bad soon

726
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:53,020
I think it's going to be a lockdown. I want to release the names and I released obama clinton

727
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:56,460
and biden's so biden took 1.5 billion

728
00:55:57,180 --> 00:56:03,020
dollars while obama and him and his administration were given reports by the cia

729
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:04,460
um

730
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:09,580
and white house documents that were in the bush administration and from human rights

731
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:16,860
councils that china is not only harvesting people with organs, but they're using our technologies and

732
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:23,420
Um and different things to suppress their own people and put them in camps and and so on they threaten different things

733
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:26,540
But they let us do it. So obama let let us do business with them, right?

734
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:34,300
Not only that he let biden take 1.5 billion. How do you take 1.5 billion dollars where that money come from?

735
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:39,580
Okay, so that was another thing the other the fourth thing I I I sued was

736
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:43,900
It's really hard for people to get it at the beginning now on this amendment. They got it

737
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,900
AI coding and AI

738
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:47,500
um

739
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,500
algorithmic manipulation

740
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,500
of the entire human race

741
00:56:51,500 --> 00:57:00,300
Against their free will understanding or knowledge that they're being completely not only programmed but manipulated throughout the entire spectrum

742
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:05,900
And that's being done to the platforms and not telling them that these smartphones

743
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:12,620
Attach your nervous system and it's it's mapping out their brain and it's taking it back to

744
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:17,820
To google and other things but also programming people and literally altering the brain chemistry

745
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:20,540
So I put that in the lawsuit. I have 87 page

746
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,100
lawsuit still people

747
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:28,220
Wouldn't support me because they see the content that I put out is like no one in the world had done something like this

748
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:35,980
87 page report and I sued also the world bank for giving money to china and and different places. I sued

749
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:42,780
And and different places. I sued. Um, um obama for giving 150 billion dollars to the iranian regime

750
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:48,220
That wasn't given to the iranian people because it belonged to the iranian people. It was actually given

751
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:50,140
to

752
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:53,740
Um to the iranian regime that was used to start more conflicts

753
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:59,980
With more beefs, right? So why are you giving 150 billion dollars?

754
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:07,020
When the iranian citizens are being killed so china gave technology facial recognition and other things

755
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:11,740
That was used to hunt the iranian citizens to rape girls in iran

756
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:15,020
To even suicide them

757
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:21,660
That came from china. So my message too is so I really don't have any um emotion to iranian people

758
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:26,060
um, my family they're irani, but I consider myself an american and

759
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:33,420
Um, I I care about everybody the same but since I speak farsi, um, i'll just tell you guys something in english first

760
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:36,940
I truly believe that

761
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,180
You guys are in grave danger

762
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:42,220
If you allow your regime or your regime

763
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:46,300
Every looked the other way, but we need to cut off our ties with them and renounce

764
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:48,620
This is very very

765
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:50,620
Decouple completely

766
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:55,660
Completely but not but you need to completely denounce the communist regime and expose them

767
00:58:55,660 --> 00:59:00,140
Because the the communist regime is a plague for humanity

768
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:05,900
And look at the play that's coming now, right? It is really a plague for the entire human race

769
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:13,340
So I think a lot of lives in iran are at stake. I don't just mean to the virus through conflicts. Okay, because

770
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:20,140
There's emotions iranian people sometimes can have emotions and get really angry fast. I don't care

771
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:24,540
I'll just do this and the government may do something like that. But think about it

772
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:27,820
And then the u.s. May may react and take out a lot of people

773
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:33,820
So and that's because of china because china's influence to people the chinese are super clever

774
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,820
I mean, you don't understand how clever they are

775
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:40,700
When you look at their face, I don't mean just chinese living in uh in the u.s

776
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:46,860
Or where they're grown up here. So we have something called abc american-born chinese. Okay in america. I don't mean that

777
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:49,420
But people who grew up in china

778
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,500
Under the communist regime you have

779
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:59,420
You have uh, the commodities are less you have 1.5 billion people the government forces everything and it's a jungle people fighting for things

780
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,740
You have to almost be a wolf

781
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:04,540
So they're so clever. They can look at you in the face

782
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:12,140
Nothing will change not even a a hair will move or an eyelash and they'll lie lie to you in a hundred different ways

783
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:14,620
And do a narrative and you'll believe it

784
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:22,140
And that's how and they can they can come and tell you truths and to deflect and social engineer an entire company

785
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:25,820
or university or an entire nation

786
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:32,780
By just utilizing japan people and their victims themselves because the chinese people are victims of the communist party

787
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:35,260
This teaching of Mao Zedong

788
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,800
brainwashed an entire civilization

789
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:40,380
That was rooted in ethics

790
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:45,900
Um and daoist and buddhist, um and christian and and confucius

791
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:51,260
Ethics forget about people who don't like religion. I just mean ethics

792
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:58,700
Okay, they had ethics set in place of telling the truth and not deceiving people not hurting others, but that's how they are. So

793
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:01,580
I don't mean massive chinese, but

794
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:08,540
Unfortunately, you know, I have 1500 phone numbers in my phone that are chinese and they're the good ones and

795
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:13,740
And they're really really they even tell me like I have to work on myself because i'm a professional liar

796
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:18,620
I just I grew up in china and I just one thing happens out of emotion. I'll just lie left on the right

797
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:23,660
So and iranians are extremely clever. I was just going to say that it sounds a lot like iranians

798
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:27,660
Yes, yes, I didn't want to insult the iranian people, but they're gonna have to too, right?

799
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:29,740
It's true. Well, it's

800
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:32,860
It's because of the socialist system, right?

801
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:39,020
The socialist system creates a system that allows it gets people to start fighting each other and becoming wolves

802
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:43,980
And you don't have enough stuff and people cheat and it becomes worse and worse. It becomes a jungle

803
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:45,980
in the u.s

804
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:49,420
it i'm not saying capitalism not wolves either right but

805
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:57,020
It's a better system of checks and balances if you look at our constitution our constitution came from the greeks

806
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:00,780
Previously came from a xenophon from cyrus the great

807
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:07,340
So this is the greatest works of all the people's brains at least the european and the middle eastern which are similar people

808
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:09,580
That came into one document

809
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:16,540
So that is a great thing and we should uh have our ai systems over that and and other things

810
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:22,540
Model after this that being said we have an issue a lot of phd people or empirical people

811
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:27,020
They're the ones uh being the ai regulators and their way of thinking is a narrow

812
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:32,860
They don't look at it in a science fiction way and even there's a part in their brain as soon as you say something

813
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:34,300
It's unbelievable

814
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:38,940
It completely shuts off and they attack you or they just don't see it and they don't agree

815
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:45,580
Then you have all these billionaires that are invested in the five years of some ai and they want to by engineer you

816
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:48,140
They want to do cybernetics

817
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:54,220
They invest all this money that will translate into trillions and trillions of dollars in the next five or ten years

818
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:56,780
So they're invested into it

819
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:58,780
Their outlook is well

820
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:02,220
They're not going to think about it could kill 10 million people or 100 million people

821
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:07,740
They're just thinking about oh my company my money blah blah blah. It's completely out of selfish emotion

822
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:10,620
I'm not stopping themselves to think so right now

823
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:13,180
This is a bad pandemic that we have

824
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:15,180
Um, it's really horrible

825
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:18,220
On the other hand, it's a great thing in some some regards

826
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:23,180
It gets people to sit down and talk to sit back and do a reset and stop

827
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:25,580
And think why are we here?

828
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:26,860
so

829
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:30,780
from a from a physical perspective, okay, it was

830
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:37,420
Us transferring all this technology and not caring being complicit in china and being um being this way

831
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:43,180
And then the logical perspective would be okay the geopolitics of everything that connects china iran the u.s

832
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:49,020
And the whole world and the trade and finances and the ai but there's a spiritual component

833
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:55,820
If you look at ancient civilizations, not only just the religious text, not only their civilization, but there's artifacts

834
01:03:56,700 --> 01:04:03,420
Attesting to their civilization they go to a certain point they get destructed get destroyed and they always point back to

835
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:06,300
The technology got

836
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:10,060
More than the people's ethics or the people became really corrupt

837
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:16,220
So I have to become a better person. I have to become completely selfless

838
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:23,260
Um, and altruistic and i'm not i'm kind of in the middle. I've been trying to be selfless and be more rational and and try to

839
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:25,900
Try to see things in a more clear way

840
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:33,580
So I need to do this and if the whole world can do that and try to hurt others, but also repent if you've ever hurt anybody

841
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:39,100
If you've if you've hurt a girl you ruined her life by telling you love her and then you know

842
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,900
You guys you get what i'm saying

843
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:47,580
Um, if if you if you've coerced somebody into a real estate deal if you've uh, you know

844
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:53,980
Caused conflicts with other people that's huge. It was your fault that you were greedy if you've stolen

845
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:58,940
I should all look inside and to ourselves sincerely repent

846
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:05,020
And try to improve our consciousness and improve ourselves our souls our beings our character

847
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:08,940
Maybe by doing that but also exposing the communist party

848
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:12,620
maybe humanity has a good chance of

849
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:19,340
Of going to the next stage in a really positive way. So that's that's kind of my message not only for myself

850
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:24,220
For everyone else, um, you know, i'm an ai guy and a security guy

851
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:27,440
But I was able to do all these years of meditation

852
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:34,220
And tai chi and martial arts and I learned from other people. Okay, it doesn't really come from me

853
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:39,820
Most of it just from maybe from learning from other people, right? So i'm taking that knowledge

854
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:44,620
And I hope to share that with whoever wants me to have it on the show and I really thank you

855
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:49,980
Oh, absolutely. Is there any other questions you want to ask? I have three more questions for you

856
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:57,820
Two of them, uh the ending questions, but um, my approach to the podcast has always been i'm interested in anything that is interesting

857
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:00,380
and I I believe that

858
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:05,820
We have to hear everyone but listen to a very few people, uh, who make sense to us. So

859
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:10,380
You know, i'm not judging or reassessing or anything like that. What's interesting to me?

860
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:15,100
I hear it and I allow our audience to hear it in a very uncut unedited kind of a way

861
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:19,260
Uh, they can make their own mind what they want to believe in it

862
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:24,780
But you know, we can always learn from people and take something that we can use towards our own journey

863
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:28,300
That's that's uh, my philosophy. I'm interested in what we can learn from other people

864
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:30,780
That's that's uh, my philosophy. I'm interested to know

865
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:35,020
After laying the context in such a beautiful way with respect to china

866
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:41,420
What's at stake if united states end up electing biden or any other democrat in november?

867
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:43,740
um

868
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:47,420
Your freedoms will all be lost. Yeah, that's what I think too. Absolutely

869
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:49,980
surveillance states

870
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:51,980
and potentially

871
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:54,220
death through conflicts

872
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:59,260
Of a lot of people around the world now if people believe in some people believe in the end times

873
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:04,700
Okay, some people wanted to happen the iranian regime part of them wanted to happen and

874
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:11,660
Some people maybe is connected to the white house. They also want to bring their the rapture that they call it, right?

875
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:13,340
um

876
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:15,340
I think something like that

877
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:20,460
Could happen but not in the way they think let's say if there is going to be some type of savior

878
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:24,700
I think there's going to be a next stage. Uh, it's going to be a hope for humankind

879
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:30,700
And I don't if but if people want to actually create a conflict because they want to bring a savior

880
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:35,820
I think they're going to be in the wrong and and they're they're going to go end up in a bad place

881
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:38,940
I don't mean someone in the white house, right? That's not what I meant

882
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:44,140
But i'm saying people that try to go in into anywhere or iran, um, or china doesn't believe in that stuff

883
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:46,140
They just want to use

884
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:47,260
whatever so

885
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:48,460
um

886
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:52,780
If biden's elected, um, which he will not unless somebody cheats

887
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:59,740
Um, yes, it is the worst thing you could ever imagine. But here's the thing if president trump is elected

888
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:01,660
It'll be much better

889
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:06,380
But we need we need to support. Um, so his his hands are tied

890
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:10,060
He has a lot of power, but then he doesn't he's always like

891
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:12,620
counter and check in the white house because

892
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:18,940
The white house is connected to the big tech companies the drug farmer companies the cia the fbi

893
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:25,500
And different think tanks different universities and every person that has that wants to get something done

894
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:30,000
So if president trump has a certain model for the country that's based on the constitution

895
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:35,740
He can't pick everything that's positive at the moment because once he picks one piece

896
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:38,860
The other piece comes in and attacks the other piece

897
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:43,900
Uh, so he has to give away here and there so he doesn't get taken out himself

898
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:48,860
Think about it with the 4g system. They almost took him out mobilizing the entire media. So

899
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:52,940
They're putting on the 5g system and I know president trump has read my articles

900
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:57,900
He got my book and I know he's he knows what i'm saying now about the 5g and he's thinking differently now

901
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:04,220
And so is the ai department but still it's hard from the belief how people can be bi-digitally social programmed

902
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:06,700
And it's a very very deep

903
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,220
concept

904
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:09,740
That I turned

905
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:15,840
And also links with another term I brought up which is called the human bio digital network, which is very very sophisticated

906
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:18,300
It would take me hours to explain

907
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:24,940
so putting these together and then the geopolitics of everything and how people think and

908
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:29,900
The possibilities of so many bad things that could happen is numerous

909
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:34,060
So that's why I say the best thing we can do is improve our character

910
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:36,620
really become calm

911
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:38,620
and rational people

912
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:44,620
And not to do anything as extreme like lock everybody down lock everything down at one moment

913
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:47,180
Don't even deliver food anymore

914
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:55,180
Because sure it can prevent less disease with the correct conflicts and a hundred different other things because this virus is not going to kill every

915
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:56,940
single person

916
01:09:56,940 --> 01:10:03,740
So you have to have a middle ground so in tai chi, you know, there's something like you pull and you push right?

917
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:09,580
I'm sorry, and then there's like yin and yang as a concept if you put or a bird if you put a bird in the cage

918
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:12,700
If you squeeze it too much, it's going to die

919
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:18,700
If you open the cage, it's going to go you have to be neutral to it. Right? So with this pandemic

920
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:25,100
What we need to do is be sort of like a checks and balances with it not go to the extreme

921
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:30,460
Excellent. Cyrus's book is called art. Well, one of your book is called artificial intelligence

922
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:37,760
Dangerous to humanity ai u.s china big tech facial recognition drones smartphones internet of things 5j robotics cybernetics and biodigital

923
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,240
social programming

924
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:46,720
Absolute pleasure having you on the show. What's next for you and where can our audience follow your future works?

929
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:04,000
And try to sink in the entire book. I have videos

930
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:10,560

So it's it's it's puts a pleasure to sit down with somebody who knows everything

937
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:42,080
Well, thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Um, let me ask you the last question

938
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:45,680
I ask all my guests this should be interesting coming from your perspective

939
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:51,680
That if you come come across an intelligent alien from a different civilization, what would you say?

940
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:55,120
Is the worst thing humanity has done and what would you say is our greatest achievement?

941
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,680
Repeat the second half of the question

942
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:06,480
Well, let me say the whole question again if you come across an intelligent alien from a different civilization

943
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:12,560
What would you say is the worst thing humanity has done? And what would you say is our greatest achievement?

944
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:19,360
Well, what would he say or what would I what would you say to the intelligent alien the worst and the best that humanity has achieved?

945
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,120
I would say

946
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,360
The best thing we've achieved is exposing you

947
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:32,560
And the worst thing we've achieved was uh, not realizing what you were doing for the past 100 years

948
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:39,360
That's great, how do you like that answer it's perfect

949
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,400
love it

950
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:46,640
Let me let me put something else in my in here because we're getting really metaphysical. Yeah, man

951
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:56,080
Do it. I wasn't expecting this. So so I did all these things maybe maybe it's having the expectation at all

952
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:58,480
That is one of our biggest enemy as well

953
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:05,440
So there is um, yes, there are trillions and trillions of universes and parallel universes

954
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:10,880
Cadrillions and quadrillions and quadrillions of planets and that's all at the level of molecules

955
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,080
And there's atomic realms and some and there's so many quantum realms

956
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:19,920
And there's you know in my book I talk about how in history it even the persians talk about ai

957
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:26,480
And you'd have to read this book. Okay, so but I don't I don't talk about aliens. I just talk about you know

958
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,480
There's just that right?

959
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,720
And this is what the samarians say and so on

960
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,440
In

961
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:37,120
In 2002 when I got back from china because 99 I went to china

962
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:40,880
The reason why I went there because I wanted to write a book which I which I wrote and finished

963
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:45,600
No, two was 800 pages. It's called better people better world the book to save and change a better world

964
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:50,400
It brought the issue of iran china the u.s. The tech

965
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:55,920
Society human trafficking sex trafficking broken marriages everything you could think of into one book

966
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:58,720
And I come to publish it

967
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,360
Nobody would publish it. Oh, you don't have a degree

968
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:08,560
Okay, who the hell are you writing this stuff? I give my bachelor's and master's and adjoining finish phd, but no two

969
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:15,520
Um, i'll just tell you the lower version of it. So it's hard to believe. Um, let's say it was just a lucid dream and not a vision

970
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:20,000
Okay, but I saw some time in the future that

971
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:24,080
Somebody became president. I didn't know who it was. It was a white guy

972
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,480
he was

973
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:29,440
About six three six four blue eyes and blonde hair

974
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,320
And then something happened and the whole world like was becoming into chaos

975
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:38,640
and i've said this in my other interviews some other ones that are kind of metaphysical and

976
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:44,880
Then something happens and everyone's against each other white is white black against black and i'm like, this is 2002

977
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,640
I was like, why would whites be against whites and black against blacks?

978
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:55,120
Because back then, you know, there's still a bit of a racial divide. I didn't get it because the vision wasn't clear

979
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,360
I was sitting and I couldn't see everything perfectly

980
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:01,920
Then I saw the next step but something happened iran. It was on cnn. It was a nuclear thing

981
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,400
Then something else happened and 6.2 billion people died

982
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:05,840
so

983
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:10,160
And one of the main reasons this was a dream or like a vision

984
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:15,520
I was sitting down. Let's say okay, that's all I say so so

985
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:19,600
But I couldn't see who what I just knew was I didn't know it was trump

986
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,720
But when he went up the elevator, i'm like, that's the guy in my dream

987
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,400
And that's why I ran up and created these companies right away

988
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:29,440
And and I created they are and that's why I invented the

989
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,440
companies. I'm like, what if

990
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,280
that dream

991
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:34,800
is correct

992
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:40,000
So mess all these companies and then i'm telling people around me. He's going to become president. You're nuts even the christians

993
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:47,280
He'll become president. You're nuts. Thank you became president. So then then I get to uh, well, I think this is going to happen with china

994
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,880
No one's going to freaking believe me. So i'm like, okay. I have good research investing abilities

995
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:56,640
Why don't I just try to bring a narrative in that everyone's in danger by by investing in this company?

996
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:59,200
And then writing these books and giving these reports to

997
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:02,480
former cia and secret service and different things

998
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:09,520
And uh, I did that and everything I found matched the dream almost in identical way

999
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,600
But I I just thought what if the dream is dream is correct?

1000
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:18,800
And I don't really follow dreams, but i'm like, why did I see that in 2002?

1001
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:24,560
Right, so then I then I find all these studies. I'm like the world's in danger and I was like, okay

1002
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:27,440
The world's in danger and I was right. So

1003
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:34,240
Are that many people going to die? Uh, probably not. Are we going to be here next 20 years? 100 we're going to be here

1004
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:42,240
Are a lot of people in danger through conflicts potentially? Yeah, there is a concept of destiny and there's a concept of free will

1005
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,320
They're both intertwined

1006
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:48,000
People have free wills, but there is a destiny that's kind of faith

1007
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,920
But then you look at maybe science there's a pattern of things, right?

1008
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:55,920
So you do things that has a cause and effect and a chain reaction

1009
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,280
so

1010
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:02,720
If we have things that are happening at the moment and it happened last year and it's gonna happen next year through trump

1011
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,440
through china and iran

1012
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,280
and all the little

1013
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,040
Little chess pieces

1014
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:12,000
This chain of reaction can cause a huge global

1015
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:17,280
Like conflict that can kill a lot of people in addition to russia. That's why I say everybody stop

1016
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:19,600
a point at china

1017
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:24,480
Expose them and the regime will just fall and it'll be a lot safer

1018
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:31,120
And I think but most important thing we need to be rational and just think of what I said is just a just a story

1019
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:35,120
Okay, I don't want to scare anybody but uh, it's just a story and but

1020
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:41,200
look at the data I put in this book and look at what's happening now that I was right and then look at other people that

1021
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:46,880
were right and let's expose them and improve ourselves and use this time in the pandemic to

1022
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,160
um

1023
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:55,280
To raise our our awakening that that's my opinion for myself and whoever agrees with me. So that's the last thing I have to say

1024
01:17:55,280 --> 01:18:18,180
Maybe this is a very strange interview for you. Excellent. Loved it. Loved it

1025
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,280
You
