00:00.000 --> 00:05.280
It's put a crack in the illusion of social constructions, you know, I mean, people go

00:05.280 --> 00:10.400
to jobs and then all of a sudden they're kind of like, my job isn't very real.

00:10.400 --> 00:15.240
It was just a place I went to and I did some stuff and then I came home.

00:15.240 --> 00:16.560
That's what jobs are.

00:16.560 --> 00:20.960
And now people are working from home and they're questioning, you know, it's been a very big

00:20.960 --> 00:24.240
shift in some of the fundamentals of the thinking mind.

00:24.240 --> 00:27.340
The thinking mind loves what it would call normalcy.

00:27.340 --> 00:32.160
It strives towards that and we can't have it.

00:32.160 --> 00:38.400
It's saying, no, the thinking mind was denied the very thing it seeks, which is just this

00:38.400 --> 00:48.280
kind of predictability.

00:48.280 --> 00:52.320
Hello and welcome to the 75th episode of Neohuman Podcasts.

00:52.320 --> 00:56.200
I'm Agabahari, an agologist on Twitter and Instagram and you can follow this show on

00:56.200 --> 01:01.680
LiveInLimbo.com, iTunes, YouTube, BitChute and soon on Spotify following the lead of

01:01.680 --> 01:02.960
Joe Rogan.

01:02.960 --> 01:09.720
And on this episode, I'm welcoming back Chris Niebar and welcome back to Neohuman, Chris.

01:09.720 --> 01:10.720
Thanks.

01:10.720 --> 01:11.720
Great to be here.

01:11.720 --> 01:12.720
Yeah, man.

01:12.720 --> 01:18.800
It's like a different world since the last time that we spoke and you came to my mind

01:18.800 --> 01:22.160
literally the first person when this corona thing happened.

01:22.160 --> 01:27.280
I have to talk to Chris Niebar and it took me about 10 episodes to get to you, but things

01:27.280 --> 01:29.120
happen as they happen.

01:29.120 --> 01:34.320
Let's start for those of our audience who are not familiar with you, with your background,

01:34.320 --> 01:37.520
the lives you've lived and what are you mainly focused on now these days?

01:37.520 --> 01:40.680
Yeah, those are some good questions.

01:40.680 --> 01:45.000
My research for the last 30 years has been in the left and right sides of the brain and

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
how they differ.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.480
That's an interesting field to be in these days because on the one hand, the worst thing

01:50.480 --> 01:53.280
that could happen for a scientist is your ideas become popular.

01:53.280 --> 01:58.260
As soon as they became popular, then everyone dismissed it and so when I tell people I do

01:58.260 --> 02:02.040
left right brain research, they're like, oh, I thought that whole thing was disproven.

02:02.040 --> 02:06.240
I'm like, well, no, it's more complex than that.

02:06.240 --> 02:14.120
But then along the whole way, I've been doing – the neuroscience led me up to a certain

02:14.120 --> 02:18.560
level of understanding and I always felt that it was just part of the picture.

02:18.560 --> 02:26.000
So for the last 30 years, I've also been studying Buddhism, Zen, Taoism, Hindu philosophy

02:26.000 --> 02:28.760
and to me, they made a very nice match.

02:28.760 --> 02:37.680
I found it pretty easy to kind of weave the two together into kind of a philosophy or

02:37.680 --> 02:40.720
a kind of system and that's what I've been working on.

02:40.720 --> 02:45.180
That's what I – I'm working on my second book here and the second book is really going

02:45.180 --> 02:47.680
to be about consciousness.

02:47.680 --> 02:52.760
And the main problem in consciousness research and how particularly in the West, we confuse

02:52.760 --> 02:57.240
the thinking mind, which is a great tool and it's the thing that's allowing us to kind

02:57.240 --> 02:59.520
of converse right now.

02:59.520 --> 03:03.400
But we confuse the thinking mind with the essence of consciousness and I think when

03:03.400 --> 03:09.880
we make that mistake, it takes us down a really weird trip and that's the problem.

03:09.880 --> 03:13.560
We have so many brilliant people doing consciousness research right now and that their biggest

03:13.560 --> 03:19.640
drawback is they're brilliant and it's their brilliant thinking mind that occupies

03:19.640 --> 03:23.080
so many of these different little puzzles and you know, it's the thing about life

03:23.080 --> 03:28.760
and the thinking mind, it's like this endless onion that has, you know, layer after – and

03:28.760 --> 03:33.440
it just keeps going on and so the thinking mind never finds any rest and so it's nice

03:33.440 --> 03:38.680
to take a break and I like to think that maybe Monday through Thursday, I'm kind of a scientist.

03:38.680 --> 03:42.240
I don't know how I slipped that in now because now Friday became part of the weekend.

03:42.240 --> 03:49.560
Then Friday through, you know, Sunday, I'm a Buddhist, you know, I'm a Taoist and I

03:49.560 --> 03:55.920
practice meditation and I practice not thinking and so I put the thinking mind aside on the

03:55.920 --> 03:58.120
weekends to the best that I can.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.680
Sometimes it's a struggle.

03:59.680 --> 04:03.280
The thinking mind is so convinced that there are so many problems out there and the thinking

04:03.280 --> 04:09.720
mind searches for a problem and if it can't find one, it will make one up and so the weekends,

04:09.720 --> 04:12.400
you know, it's interesting.

04:12.400 --> 04:16.880
It's also interesting that not only you come up with problems that make it seem so

04:16.880 --> 04:21.080
real, once you solve that problem, it changes the goalposts.

04:21.080 --> 04:25.600
Like, oh, that was not it, you know, it was just part of –

04:25.600 --> 04:26.840
That wasn't the real problem.

04:26.840 --> 04:32.000
Now we're doing – and it just goes on and it just never – and that's the thing.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.400
The thinking mind keeps believing if I just have this much money in the bank, if I just

04:36.400 --> 04:41.480
have – if I just have this, if this will happen, then I can finally start living.

04:41.480 --> 04:46.560
And we're figuring out like that just never happens and then you end up, you know, in

04:46.560 --> 04:50.400
your 50s, you're old and then all of a sudden you're like, what happened to my life?

04:50.400 --> 04:54.920
Oh, I spent my life thinking, I spent my life thinking, creating problems and every time

04:54.920 --> 04:58.000
I solved one, another one came on the scene.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.200
And so – and that's, you know, and we're kind of experiencing that really firsthand

05:02.200 --> 05:03.200
here, you know.

05:03.200 --> 05:08.560
It's funny you said how much has changed and it's absolutely true on some level, like

05:08.560 --> 05:10.440
the whole world is different.

05:10.440 --> 05:14.640
And then on some other level, no, it's the same exact world.

05:14.640 --> 05:15.920
Everything's exactly the same.

05:15.920 --> 05:22.360
I'm sitting here in the same office, I go for the same walk, you know, but on another

05:22.360 --> 05:24.600
level it absolutely seems different.

05:24.600 --> 05:31.840
Yeah, I started talking to people when this whole thing begun focused on why this also

05:31.840 --> 05:36.840
can be an opportunity for us to realize that a lot of things that we have relied on, it's

05:36.840 --> 05:42.600
not that they've been disrupted, it's just that they've – all of them have been basically

05:42.600 --> 05:47.480
illusions and delusions and stuff that we have made up for ourselves and took them seriously

05:47.480 --> 05:55.040
and now that something is – it's very organic that it's happening and targeting our very

05:55.040 --> 05:56.040
survival.

05:56.040 --> 05:59.360
Now we're realizing, oh, we can't rely on government, we can't rely on my degree,

05:59.360 --> 06:03.800
we can't rely on our jobs and a lot of people are freaking out exactly because of that it

06:03.800 --> 06:04.800
seems like.

06:04.800 --> 06:10.600
It's put a crack in the illusion of social constructions, you know, I mean people go

06:10.600 --> 06:15.700
to jobs and then all of a sudden they're kind of like, my job isn't very real.

06:15.700 --> 06:20.520
It was just a place I went to and I did some stuff and then I came home.

06:20.520 --> 06:24.840
That's what jobs are and now people are working from home and they're questioning, you know,

06:24.840 --> 06:29.520
it's been a very big shift in some of the fundamentals of the thinking mind.

06:29.520 --> 06:32.640
The thinking mind loves what it would call normalcy.

06:32.640 --> 06:37.440
It strives towards that and we can't have it.

06:37.440 --> 06:43.720
It's saying no, the thinking mind was denied the very thing it seeks, which is just this

06:43.720 --> 06:50.240
kind of predictability and now all of a sudden – and now we get no end state.

06:50.240 --> 06:54.920
I don't know how things are where you're at here in Pennsylvania, it's not quite the

06:54.920 --> 07:00.040
same all over the country of course, but we still have no particular end state and so

07:00.040 --> 07:05.600
the thinking mind could probably deal with quite a bit if it knew in some point if it

07:05.600 --> 07:11.840
could bring all these illusions back online and it's like putting this permanent kind

07:11.840 --> 07:16.920
of we don't know when we can bring those back online so they may be permanently, you

07:16.920 --> 07:22.920
know, jobs and some of our social roles and like you mentioned government and I've been

07:22.920 --> 07:27.320
doing a couple of videos on the idea of what government even means and what would it mean

07:27.320 --> 07:32.600
if we didn't have government and the idea of control and self-control.

07:32.600 --> 07:34.600
That's one of the main things about the thinking mind.

07:34.600 --> 07:39.780
It's always this game of control and then when you put – like I said, I try to give

07:39.780 --> 07:44.720
myself a break over the weekends and put the thinking mind away for a little bit and what

07:44.720 --> 07:51.200
I realized is that the moments of levity and the moments of just this beautiful consciousness

07:51.200 --> 07:56.940
are almost always when I put down this notion of control and this insistence that reality

07:56.940 --> 08:02.200
has to be some particular way and then you pick up and you're like this must be like

08:02.200 --> 08:05.760
this and everything gets heavy again and –

08:05.760 --> 08:12.840
And then you build your expectations on that basis which is a sandcastle to begin with.

08:12.840 --> 08:19.520
Yeah, yeah and then it's just that wonderful, you know, game that we've been playing.

08:19.520 --> 08:23.680
The game that we've been playing for a long time has – it's like, you know, everyone

08:23.680 --> 08:26.720
is playing Monopoly and someone just came and hit the board and said no, this is just

08:26.720 --> 08:27.720
a game.

08:27.720 --> 08:30.560
We're like – we're kind of like no, it's – we want to – like you mentioned

08:30.560 --> 08:34.880
how we take things seriously and that's something I've been pondering a lot over

08:34.880 --> 08:36.880
the last few months.

08:36.880 --> 08:42.400
It's this – in fact, theoretically in terms of the left and right brain, if someone were

08:42.400 --> 08:46.120
to ask me like what's the real difference between the left and right sides of the brain,

08:46.120 --> 08:51.040
at least for right now, I would probably say the left brain takes the world terribly seriously

08:51.040 --> 08:56.600
and the right brain just sees it as a play, a joke, a game and it's not terribly serious

08:56.600 --> 09:01.360
about anything and you can see that kind of attitude and when you get serious, which again,

09:01.360 --> 09:07.040
we've kind of turned a lot on to the seriousness lately, you know, this must happen, this has

09:07.040 --> 09:10.360
to happen and that just gets everyone, you know, what is it?

09:10.360 --> 09:18.400
It's just this kind of tense contraction of the muscles that people feel and we're

09:18.400 --> 09:19.400
paying the price for it.

09:19.400 --> 09:25.440
You can see all over, like in the US, you can see the suicide rates, the addiction rates,

09:25.440 --> 09:30.520
I mean everything is just kind of going through the roof because it's like we're a kid

09:30.520 --> 09:34.680
and, you know, we won our way and someone came along and said you're not getting it

09:34.680 --> 09:37.160
and the thinking mind has no clue what to do with that.

09:37.160 --> 09:44.480
It's funnier saying it, one of our relatives, she actually, she will turn 70 in two or three

09:44.480 --> 09:45.480
days.

09:45.480 --> 09:49.480
In the beginning of all of this, we were like, hey, you have to take care of yourself, stay

09:49.480 --> 09:54.400
home, don't go out and she wasn't taking it seriously whatsoever, she went to the casino,

09:54.400 --> 09:58.840
she went to a whole bunch of shopping mall and all of a sudden, right now, she's not

09:58.840 --> 10:01.960
even allowing her husband to order pizza.

10:01.960 --> 10:08.560
You know, when she comes over, everybody should wear a mask.

10:08.560 --> 10:15.880
This conviction that what you have in mind is the objective truth and objective reality

10:15.880 --> 10:19.400
and because people don't agree with you, it just means that they're wrong and they

10:19.400 --> 10:26.400
have to be convinced how wrong they are and all it produces from my perspective is just

10:26.400 --> 10:32.400
further and further anxiety and energy that is being wasted because you're achieving

10:32.400 --> 10:33.400
nothing.

10:33.400 --> 10:42.320
You're going against a far bigger reality that you're not even acknowledging its existence.

10:42.320 --> 10:47.900
This notion, so I try not to watch too much of the news but I do sometimes keep up on

10:47.900 --> 10:51.240
things because there's a certain need where you feel like, you know, you don't want to

10:51.240 --> 10:56.960
be totally out of the loop on something this big and I have yet to hear someone just come

10:56.960 --> 11:01.040
right out and say, look, we don't have a clue as to what's going on.

11:01.040 --> 11:02.040
We really don't know.

11:02.040 --> 11:05.680
Maybe this virus will wipe out the human race or maybe it's absolutely nothing and it's

11:05.680 --> 11:09.960
trivial and that's very difficult for the thinking mind to deal with.

11:09.960 --> 11:15.080
The thinking mind would rather have a bad idea and feel conclusive about it, you know,

11:15.080 --> 11:20.280
than to just admit, I don't know and you know, and we don't know.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.280
We don't know what's going to happen.

11:21.280 --> 11:22.280
And we never know.

11:22.280 --> 11:24.480
I mean, that's the weird thing about this trip we call life.

11:24.480 --> 11:30.320
I mean, I've known people who have worried and, you know, kept them up all night over

11:30.320 --> 11:34.040
things and then something else came along in their life and killed them and they had

11:34.040 --> 11:40.040
no clue that that was waiting for them, you know, that old saying, you know, you make

11:40.040 --> 11:47.440
plans and God laughs and, you know, we're so sure our plans, oh, well, we need to do

11:47.440 --> 11:53.240
this or we need to do that and I, you know, where's the movement who's just admitting

11:53.240 --> 11:58.720
and embracing the idea that we just don't know, you know, it's like Alan Watts, that

11:58.720 --> 12:03.960
wisdom of insecurity, you know, there's a certain truth that we just, as much as the

12:03.960 --> 12:08.320
thinking mind wants to control nature, the problem with nature is it's an incredibly

12:08.320 --> 12:13.880
complex system and complex systems are very difficult to predict.

12:13.880 --> 12:18.760
So when you talk about viruses alone and then you add in the human element, that makes it

12:18.760 --> 12:20.120
even more unpredictable.

12:20.120 --> 12:24.680
Human beings are very difficult to predict and maybe it's free will or maybe it's just

12:24.680 --> 12:29.520
that we're caught, I mean, you can predict us in groups, you know, so they have to Thanksgiving,

12:29.520 --> 12:33.200
lots of people are going to go shopping and you can predict certain things like that.

12:33.200 --> 12:38.980
But you can't predict which people, like you were saying, you know, some people had a certain

12:38.980 --> 12:42.480
attitude with this and then all of a sudden everything flipped and now they're like a

12:42.480 --> 12:46.040
different person and that's the difficult thing about people, you know, on an individual

12:46.040 --> 12:49.880
basis we're really difficult to predict, I never know what I'm going to do, my wife

12:49.880 --> 12:53.920
will tell me, she's like talking to you gives me whiplash because you know, you're talking

12:53.920 --> 12:57.120
about something one moment and then you're off on some other, you know, I don't know

12:57.120 --> 12:58.120
what you're going to say.

12:58.120 --> 13:03.800
My girlfriend had the same problem with me.

13:03.800 --> 13:09.920
I'm having fun though, you know, like that's, I think that's, I think that's the message

13:09.920 --> 13:14.760
we can take from this, you know, is, and of course, and people will say, well, life and

13:14.760 --> 13:21.240
death is on a line and that's the game that, you know, are we going to take that one seriously

13:21.240 --> 13:22.240
too?

13:22.240 --> 13:26.760
You know, I mean, what if it's all a game, you know, and you know, this comes up a lot

13:26.760 --> 13:31.400
with Alan Watts and people will say, well, you know, if he was so enlightened, why did

13:31.400 --> 13:32.400
he drink so much?

13:32.400 --> 13:38.360
You know, he was a pretty bad alcoholic and probably died because of drinking related

13:38.360 --> 13:40.040
problems.

13:40.040 --> 13:44.800
But you know, then you wonder like, you know, I mean, if it really, what is the essence

13:44.800 --> 13:48.760
of the game to live a really long life or to have, maybe it should be shorter, but you

13:48.760 --> 13:50.560
had a lot of fun with it.

13:50.560 --> 13:51.560
You know, I don't know.

13:51.560 --> 13:56.000
I mean, I, I wouldn't give there to give any advice on any of these matters except just

13:56.000 --> 14:00.200
to bring up different alternatives and, you know, like, and enjoy, you know, the different

14:00.200 --> 14:04.440
scenarios and play, you know, play the game and have a little bit of fun with it.

14:04.440 --> 14:05.440
Try to.

14:05.440 --> 14:11.560
You mentioned Alan Watts, I think Alan Watts also said, the problem is that we are taking

14:11.560 --> 14:14.480
seriously what gods have created for fun.

14:14.480 --> 14:15.480
Yep.

14:15.480 --> 14:20.000
And that's, that's put all together, you know, we're taking seriously what we, what

14:20.000 --> 14:25.640
should have been a joke, a grand cosmic joke that we should keep us laughing.

14:25.640 --> 14:30.200
And we do have these experiences, you know, or something that we get really worried about.

14:30.200 --> 14:35.640
And, you know, we can feel the muscular tension and we get all, and then all of a sudden you

14:35.640 --> 14:37.240
realize it was nothing.

14:37.240 --> 14:38.240
And then you laugh about it.

14:38.240 --> 14:43.360
You're like, I can't believe I actually got sucked into thinking how serious that was.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.440
But then we can't seem to take that.

14:45.440 --> 14:49.440
Like right now, this game that we're playing, and again, someone might get very offended

14:49.440 --> 14:52.560
to say, oh game, this isn't a game, this is serious.

14:52.560 --> 14:58.800
And I know, I understand that, but at the same time, on some kind of cosmic level, you

14:58.800 --> 15:04.720
know, can we take that message and live a life of play, you know, like kids, you know,

15:04.720 --> 15:05.720
kids are wonderful.

15:05.720 --> 15:11.560
And like Ella Watt said, you know, it's like music is interesting because people play music,

15:11.560 --> 15:16.960
but they go to work, you know, and that's the trick and we go to work, but really make

15:16.960 --> 15:23.500
it play, you know, and it's been very difficult because we're at a very serious, you know,

15:23.500 --> 15:28.240
you go out and you venture out, I mean venturing out to a local store becomes a very serious

15:28.240 --> 15:33.320
kind of thing, you know, and mask wearing, the whole mask debate, I did a video on, you

15:33.320 --> 15:37.960
know, should we be wearing masks and that's a very, you know, I mean, can you imagine

15:37.960 --> 15:41.240
like 10 years ago, someone saying, oh, by the way, there's going to be this kind of

15:41.240 --> 15:45.080
like, you know, war over whether you should wear a mask or not.

15:45.080 --> 15:49.720
I mean, you'd find it kind of like, in a way, I can't imagine people would take that,

15:49.720 --> 15:50.720
you know, why?

15:50.720 --> 15:55.880
And who knows how people will retrospectively look at this and it's the same thing.

15:55.880 --> 16:00.360
No one knows, really, whether if I go out today with a mask on or if I go out without

16:00.360 --> 16:02.360
them, no one knows what the consequences are.

16:02.360 --> 16:04.160
The system is far too complex.

16:04.160 --> 16:05.160
Yeah.

16:05.160 --> 16:10.800
And the idea that we can be protected 100% because all of a sudden we decided to wear

16:10.800 --> 16:17.600
masks because, you know, this is a very different society, I'm in Florida, you're in Pennsylvania,

16:17.600 --> 16:21.800
but if you go to Japan, people have been wearing masks for decades in Japan.

16:21.800 --> 16:27.560
If you're sick, you wear a mask, but that has not much to do with you being shamed or

16:27.560 --> 16:28.800
forced to do it.

16:28.800 --> 16:35.200
This is like just an ethic thing, like nice thing, you know, you're being a decent human

16:35.200 --> 16:38.920
being not wanting to spread your sickness to other people.

16:38.920 --> 16:43.960
Well, that's understandable, but to say that, hey, you're not allowed to live outside of

16:43.960 --> 16:49.440
your home if you're not wearing a mask, then you got to wonder what else is coming after

16:49.440 --> 16:52.640
that, that this whole narrative is based on fear.

16:52.640 --> 16:53.640
There is nothing else.

16:53.640 --> 16:55.340
Hey, be afraid of this.

16:55.340 --> 17:00.480
We got to put, you know, all of these restrictions and controls and everything more and more

17:00.480 --> 17:06.960
aspects of your life, maybe so people can be even more predictable.

17:06.960 --> 17:10.040
What you said about group thinking, I'm thinking about that.

17:10.040 --> 17:11.680
I don't care about birthdays.

17:11.680 --> 17:13.200
I'm offending people with that.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.560
I don't care about holidays.

17:14.560 --> 17:17.480
I'm offending people with that, but I cannot take it seriously.

17:17.480 --> 17:23.600
I don't understand what is the point of celebrating a day that is just a random day we came up

17:23.600 --> 17:27.200
with and something has happened, but people are taking it very seriously.

17:27.200 --> 17:31.080
But now that you're saying that, I'm thinking maybe those days and those events, they exist

17:31.080 --> 17:36.800
to begin with to predict people and sell them stuff and built upon that.

17:36.800 --> 17:41.080
Well, that's the thing about the thinking mind.

17:41.080 --> 17:45.520
It figures out, it's very difficult to control the thinking mind and one of my favorite exercises

17:45.520 --> 17:49.120
is just, you know, a simple thing like don't think of the number 13 and sure enough, people

17:49.120 --> 17:54.920
will think of the number 13 and so the thinking mind, you realize that it's difficult if not

17:54.920 --> 17:57.720
impossible to control and that's what we deal with when we meditate.

17:57.720 --> 17:58.720
You know, you're sitting there.

17:58.720 --> 18:02.880
I remember when I was in my 20s and I would try to meditate and I thought if I could just

18:02.880 --> 18:07.640
control my mind and today that seems so laughable.

18:07.640 --> 18:09.360
You can't control your mind.

18:09.360 --> 18:11.480
Oxymoronic, yeah.

18:11.480 --> 18:14.920
And so, you know, and then you figure out you just let it kind of do its thing.

18:14.920 --> 18:19.280
But the mind seems like when it can't control itself, the first thing it does is start to

18:19.280 --> 18:25.160
control other minds and it seems to find quite a bit of satisfaction with this.

18:25.160 --> 18:28.560
And I think I've kind of feel like a stranger in humanity with this.

18:28.560 --> 18:32.600
I don't, at least on the surface, I've never felt like I've gotten anything out of trying

18:32.600 --> 18:33.680
to control other minds.

18:33.680 --> 18:37.880
But as I observe other humans, that seems to be one of the things, it's one of our hobbies,

18:37.880 --> 18:38.880
you know.

18:38.880 --> 18:44.040
It's like we want to control other minds and I mean, and this whole debate seems to be

18:44.040 --> 18:48.400
like, why do I care what you do?

18:48.400 --> 18:51.680
Shouldn't I be a little more concerned with why I'm concerned with what you're, why am

18:51.680 --> 18:54.160
I concerned with what you're doing?

18:54.160 --> 18:58.520
But that's that thing in our culture, you know.

18:58.520 --> 19:03.600
We shifted over to the external and instead of turning it inward and I mean, that's quite

19:03.600 --> 19:07.720
a thing to ponder, I think, you know, to walk away from and go, you know, that dude, you

19:07.720 --> 19:11.040
know, in the store wasn't wearing a mask and man, that irritates me.

19:11.040 --> 19:12.600
Why does that irritate me?

19:12.600 --> 19:13.600
You know?

19:13.600 --> 19:16.400
What is it about me that it really irritates me about that?

19:16.400 --> 19:21.040
Because I mean, we could spin scenarios, I mean, the frontal lobe is wonderful at spinning,

19:21.040 --> 19:22.040
you know, what ifs.

19:22.040 --> 19:25.520
Oh, well, if you didn't wear that mask, then there's this hypothetical possibility that

19:25.520 --> 19:28.280
this could have happened and this could have happened, that could have eventually, and

19:28.280 --> 19:32.600
we can spin scenarios like that, but we have no clue whether that's, you know, those are

19:32.600 --> 19:33.960
accurate.

19:33.960 --> 19:37.680
And I mean, the core is like, really, what was it about this person doing this thing

19:37.680 --> 19:40.600
that, you know, that set me off?

19:40.600 --> 19:44.000
And the more you investigate that stuff, man, you're gonna, you'll go on this trip, you'll

19:44.000 --> 19:50.640
find that it's all, all the stuff that bothers you, it literally is, it's a mirror shooting

19:50.640 --> 19:57.580
right back at you, figuring out, oh, you know, maybe it's a shadow kind of thing and like,

19:57.580 --> 20:01.400
maybe you want to rip your mask off and go running through, you know, and you're mad

20:01.400 --> 20:04.720
because you're wearing it, so that's what really makes you mad.

20:04.720 --> 20:09.600
And so, you know, this has been an interesting time and some people have pointed out the

20:09.600 --> 20:13.440
blessings and some of the real things that, you know, the kind of introspective moments

20:13.440 --> 20:14.440
that we can have.

20:14.440 --> 20:19.880
You know, you're sitting at home, what are you gonna do, you know, are you gonna crack

20:19.880 --> 20:25.240
open that book of philosophy, are you gonna start pondering the big questions about life

20:25.240 --> 20:28.120
and like, what are you doing here, you know?

20:28.120 --> 20:35.400
I started off with the question of consciousness and I'm like, it's one of the strangest things,

20:35.400 --> 20:39.160
the all-time strangest things about consciousness is to most people, it doesn't seem strange.

20:39.160 --> 20:44.240
It's just like, oh yeah, I'm a conscious being, you know, I have consciousness, I'm experiencing

20:44.240 --> 20:50.200
the world and that just is like the most trivial thing when if you just stumble on that, like,

20:50.200 --> 20:53.840
you know, you should just go running through the streets, go like, man, I'm a conscious

20:53.840 --> 21:00.440
being, this is the freest thing, you know, it should terrify us and, you know, send us

21:00.440 --> 21:06.080
on this amazing trip to just the fact that we're conscious and somehow we have the ability

21:06.080 --> 21:11.780
to just trivialize it and just think it's ordinary and we're more worried about someone

21:11.780 --> 21:17.080
having a mask on than, you know, contemplating the fact that I'm a conscious entity in this

21:17.080 --> 21:21.200
universe and what's my connection with other conscious and, you know, are we all, you know,

21:21.200 --> 21:25.480
those kind of questions are the ones I think, it's like, you know, stumbling into the dark

21:25.480 --> 21:31.800
forest, it's like we'd rather, you know, argue about the trivialities, I think, than kind

21:31.800 --> 21:36.360
of get into the deep stuff, but this is our task, this is a moment, you know, what are

21:36.360 --> 21:37.360
we going to do with it?

21:37.360 --> 21:41.920
What are you going to do with the extra time you're spending at home, you know?

21:41.920 --> 21:45.960
It also seems like people use those terms, God is another one, that people just throw

21:45.960 --> 21:51.080
around God and like, oh yeah, I know, I talk to God, I pray to God, but if you ask them

21:51.080 --> 21:56.440
who is God, what is God, there isn't going to be that much of an answer more than like

21:56.440 --> 22:02.760
a line or two that you can hear or read anywhere else and it seems like, it reminds me of what

22:02.760 --> 22:07.980
Stephen Hawking said that the biggest enemy of knowledge is not lack of it, but the illusion

22:07.980 --> 22:16.160
of it and it seems like we're just looking for things and elements to prove ourselves

22:16.160 --> 22:26.720
right, but we don't know that the one who's looking to be proven right is not us.

22:26.720 --> 22:32.960
Yeah, that's one of the, you know, do you believe what you believe you believe?

22:32.960 --> 22:37.360
It's a big, you know, I mean, like you said, people throw around phrases like God, it's

22:37.360 --> 22:40.440
like, well, do you really believe what you believe you believe?

22:40.440 --> 22:44.320
Is this something that you really think that there is an entity and that's controlling

22:44.320 --> 22:48.920
the universe or, you know, it's the same thing with spiritual types and you can find some

22:48.920 --> 22:52.520
spiritual types that on one hand say we're all connected and then they're flipping someone

22:52.520 --> 22:57.560
off because, you know, they're not wearing a mask and then, you know, or they'll put,

22:57.560 --> 23:06.140
you know, everyone in this thing of, well, we're all interconnected except this person.

23:06.140 --> 23:09.120
And so it's tough, you know, do you believe what you believe you believe?

23:09.120 --> 23:12.820
You know, that's a tough question that we could take this time and really contemplate

23:12.820 --> 23:13.820
on.

23:13.820 --> 23:14.820
Who is the you?

23:14.820 --> 23:15.820
That's another answer.

23:15.820 --> 23:16.820
Who is the you?

23:16.820 --> 23:25.240
Because let's say in our conversation in not you and me, but in a common two people conversation,

23:25.240 --> 23:29.200
there are four different versions of each individual, right?

23:29.200 --> 23:33.000
The one who you think you are, the one who you want other person to think you are, the

23:33.000 --> 23:40.520
one who you think the other person think you are and the one that you want other person

23:40.520 --> 23:43.040
and the one who you really are, right?

23:43.040 --> 23:52.260
So this is like we haven't even found the definition of you and I and we go around and

23:52.260 --> 23:59.560
collect different degrees and collect different certifications and credentials basically to

23:59.560 --> 24:05.880
align everybody else according to our objectives and ethics and morality and we use everything

24:05.880 --> 24:10.960
that we can culturally, socially, politically to prove that, hey, what I'm telling you is

24:10.960 --> 24:12.200
right.

24:12.200 --> 24:16.160
Just follow what I'm saying and it's all going to be all right.

24:16.160 --> 24:20.720
And in the end, what we're trying to do is convince ourselves that we are a we, like

24:20.720 --> 24:24.280
I am an I and I'm going to do everything I can to convince that there really is such

24:24.280 --> 24:25.280
a thing.

24:25.280 --> 24:30.520
I mean, we spend so much time, like you said, you know, doing whatever we can because we

24:30.520 --> 24:35.760
can know, I think we know that that's the same kind of concept of anything else that

24:35.760 --> 24:37.400
we're trying to really define.

24:37.400 --> 24:40.000
You know, if you nudge it a little bit, if you push it a little bit, we have to admit

24:40.000 --> 24:44.480
that we don't really know, you know, that's one of my favorite all time questions and

24:44.480 --> 24:48.320
I could spend so much time just, what do we mean, like, you know, we just start a conversation

24:48.320 --> 24:52.000
and then you stop the conversation and you say, oh, I noticed you said I, I mean, what

24:52.000 --> 24:58.560
do you mean by that, you know, and what do you mean when you say I, what do you and to

24:58.560 --> 25:03.640
me, all I can, I mean, I've come up with a thousand different explanations, so many different

25:03.640 --> 25:05.560
definitions of who I think I am.

25:05.560 --> 25:09.560
I realized that that's all I am is who I think I am at that particular time.

25:09.560 --> 25:10.560
Absolutely.

25:10.560 --> 25:11.560
It's fluid.

25:11.560 --> 25:19.440
It's, it's, it changes, it changes so much and so fast that it's, it amazes me that anyone

25:19.440 --> 25:24.840
could possibly take it seriously, you know, I mean, you could be all confident and like,

25:24.840 --> 25:28.080
I always think of like, you know, Denzel and training day and you know, you're going to

25:28.080 --> 25:32.440
go in there with it and then some little happens and you, you know, you fall apart like George

25:32.440 --> 25:37.440
Costanza, you know, and it's like, and that's like, wow, there's no consistency in the self.

25:37.440 --> 25:44.680
It's continuously fluid and changing and, and I'm like, how do we ever fall for it?

25:44.680 --> 25:45.680
How do we, I don't know.

25:45.680 --> 25:49.120
Like you said, we spend a lot of time trying to convince ourselves that there is something

25:49.120 --> 25:51.440
behind there, you know.

25:51.440 --> 25:57.640
Well, it's also the brainwashing and propaganda that we're all exposed to some more than others.

25:57.640 --> 26:03.600
I think I mentioned I was born in Iran and the second I was born, I was labeled as a

26:03.600 --> 26:07.320
Shia Muslim Iranian straight male.

26:07.320 --> 26:13.520
Not good luck changing any of those throughout your entire life because it's like, hey, you're

26:13.520 --> 26:16.360
born into this tribe.

26:16.360 --> 26:21.040
This is what we expect of you and you have to live your life accordingly.

26:21.040 --> 26:25.520
And I didn't, you know, I'm a male, I have no problem with male, but I literally changed

26:25.520 --> 26:32.800
all of it and I got alienated by that community, by that society because, you know, how dare

26:32.800 --> 26:39.880
you not talking about glorious history of Iran or how dare you not being straight or

26:39.880 --> 26:40.880
anything.

26:40.880 --> 26:48.240
It's just like all of this nonsense that you're being born into and then continue repeating

26:48.240 --> 26:57.040
it because you are convinced that one more day, a thousand more dollars, another degree

26:57.040 --> 27:00.360
and it's all going to be fine.

27:00.360 --> 27:03.520
And it's a road to nowhere.

27:03.520 --> 27:05.040
It's funny how you put that.

27:05.040 --> 27:09.840
The more I can convince you that you are you, the more I ultimately convince me that there's

27:09.840 --> 27:11.320
an I in there somewhere.

27:11.320 --> 27:12.320
Absolutely.

27:12.320 --> 27:17.200
If I can categorize and label you, I feel a little bit better that there's something

27:17.200 --> 27:19.880
in me that also fits these labels.

27:19.880 --> 27:23.480
If I can get you to buy the story, then I buy the story a little bit.

27:23.480 --> 27:29.040
There's a quote I've been pondering on from Krishnamurti for years and it always sort

27:29.040 --> 27:32.840
of irritated me and I think that tells you something and I'm just going to paraphrase

27:32.840 --> 27:33.840
it.

27:33.840 --> 27:38.680
It's something like if you categorize yourself in any way, you know, whether it's religion

27:38.680 --> 27:46.200
or any kind of identification with some category, you are committing an act of violence and

27:46.200 --> 27:47.200
it always kind of bothered me.

27:47.200 --> 27:50.880
I'm like, come on, man, you know, is it really violent?

27:50.880 --> 27:55.280
And I think I can understand a little bit more of what he's saying, you know, the second

27:55.280 --> 28:02.840
I categorize myself and affiliate with, I'm limiting myself from possibilities, you know,

28:02.840 --> 28:06.800
I'm fitting myself into a certain group, that means automatically I'm denying myself some

28:06.800 --> 28:12.840
other membership and I'm kind of like, I'm building, I'm taking like ever increasingly

28:12.840 --> 28:15.960
smaller boxes to put myself in.

28:15.960 --> 28:19.160
And then what happens when you find people like you who you're just like, no, I'm not

28:19.160 --> 28:24.640
going to do it and it irritates people and they're like, why won't you just fit into

28:24.640 --> 28:25.640
the box?

28:25.640 --> 28:26.640
And they get offended.

28:26.640 --> 28:27.640
Yeah.

28:27.640 --> 28:28.640
And you're just, I'm not doing it.

28:28.640 --> 28:32.040
I'm not playing that game.

28:32.040 --> 28:35.520
And that sets them people off, you know, they want you to play, you know, it's like any

28:35.520 --> 28:40.400
game we play, you know, if you kind of start making up some rules during the game, it can

28:40.400 --> 28:41.640
be irritating.

28:41.640 --> 28:46.680
But then you're just like, well, look, I'm playing a different game and you know, some

28:46.680 --> 28:51.800
days I'm more in the mood and I'm like, I throw something out and I just look at people

28:51.800 --> 28:58.160
peeling this onion that they define themselves by trying to convince me that no, look, I'm

28:58.160 --> 29:04.200
older or I've worked for government for 20 years or I have two PhDs.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.860
So obviously I'm right.

29:05.860 --> 29:07.360
So just admit it.

29:07.360 --> 29:09.220
I'm like, no, I'm not going to admit it.

29:09.220 --> 29:11.060
I don't care who you are.

29:11.060 --> 29:15.200
This is what I think and what I think is just as accurate as what you think.

29:15.200 --> 29:16.200
Yeah.

29:16.200 --> 29:23.040
It's interesting you would phrase it like that because a friend of mine, all these professors

29:23.040 --> 29:29.960
and there's almost a movement where they're trying to push reputation as a factor to take

29:29.960 --> 29:33.360
into consideration when you're trying to ascertain the truth.

29:33.360 --> 29:37.440
And there's this push like, look, we really have to and I'm like, no, reputation is kind

29:37.440 --> 29:38.440
of irrelevant.

29:38.440 --> 29:40.680
I don't care who's saying what.

29:40.680 --> 29:45.080
It's really like, let me just evaluate the argument and you know, I'm not particularly

29:45.080 --> 29:51.360
interested in who says it, but yet there seems to be this push because it makes life a little

29:51.360 --> 29:52.360
more comfortable.

29:52.360 --> 29:56.760
If I say, look, I've got these letters after my name and I tell students all the time as

29:56.760 --> 30:02.400
a joke, I'm like, you know, the whole PhD thing is this complete social construct.

30:02.400 --> 30:07.520
I mean, it exists literally because a couple of people agreed on, okay, we'll put these

30:07.520 --> 30:12.120
letters after your name and it's like this kind of shady deal that goes on, but it goes

30:12.120 --> 30:15.800
on to such an extent that everyone kind of, they don't realize that it's this kind of

30:15.800 --> 30:17.200
this kind of backdoor deal.

30:17.200 --> 30:21.120
It's like, okay, well, this person did this and this and we'll, we'll give them this kind

30:21.120 --> 30:26.720
of like, you know, status and it's like, well, okay, I mean, I guess we'll buy into it like

30:26.720 --> 30:30.320
any other social contract, but there's just not much behind it.

30:30.320 --> 30:36.760
I mean, there really isn't that much of a difference between Yale faculties and graduates

30:36.760 --> 30:39.840
and Freemasons.

30:39.840 --> 30:46.680
It's like a group of people who go through a process and they receive a credential based

30:46.680 --> 30:53.360
on which they are respected, they have the name and, or any other group or tribe or this

30:53.360 --> 31:00.920
kind of institution, right, to create, to solidify uncertainty and sell it to people

31:00.920 --> 31:02.920
as something certain.

31:02.920 --> 31:07.040
Yeah, it's interesting you would connect that with certainty.

31:07.040 --> 31:11.080
And I think that's kind of the ultimate quest of the thinking mind.

31:11.080 --> 31:16.160
It's even though it's a complete illusion, it wants to find that certainty and one of

31:16.160 --> 31:21.560
the ways that you can find predictability and certainty and just a sort of orderliness.

31:21.560 --> 31:22.560
You know, that's the thing.

31:22.560 --> 31:26.480
If you put us all in the categories, it's like taking your desk and you finally organize

31:26.480 --> 31:30.360
it all, which I almost never do, but you're like, you know, some people are really prone

31:30.360 --> 31:34.800
to that and they like to have everything, the more organized you are, the more predictable

31:34.800 --> 31:35.800
everything is.

31:35.800 --> 31:40.440
And for some people, that's very, very pleasing.

31:40.440 --> 31:44.840
And I probably mentioned the last time we talked, I probably mentioned Ian McGillcrest

31:44.840 --> 31:51.760
and his wonderful book, The Master and His Emissary, where he talks about how our culture

31:51.760 --> 31:57.880
in the West, we're obsessed with bureaucracy and we're obsessed with paperwork and it's

31:57.880 --> 31:59.520
all about control.

31:59.520 --> 32:04.640
You know, these people will want you to sign paperwork to get forms to order more forms

32:04.640 --> 32:10.160
and you can't help but to laugh about it occasionally, you know, like, well, I mean, you want me

32:10.160 --> 32:11.160
to sign this?

32:11.160 --> 32:13.400
You really want me to put a scribble on a piece of paper?

32:13.400 --> 32:20.120
And these traditions go back thousands of years, I mean, but you know, we're continuously

32:20.120 --> 32:21.120
trying to create order.

32:21.120 --> 32:28.040
I just did a video the other day about order and chaos and I kind of centered it around

32:28.040 --> 32:34.220
that 70s show, Get Smart, which I vaguely remember as a kid, but it was this funny kind

32:34.220 --> 32:40.000
of play between the chaos agents who were evil, you know, they were just like this element

32:40.000 --> 32:41.560
of randomness and we can't have that.

32:41.560 --> 32:47.480
So the control agents would continuously battle it out to find order in chaos.

32:47.480 --> 32:50.880
And that's kind of what we're trying to do, you know, the more you can label me and find

32:50.880 --> 32:55.160
me a PhD, then it makes things more predictable, you don't expect PhDs to do certain things

32:55.160 --> 33:05.280
and I just, to me, nature has always been more of a wild ride into the unpredictable.

33:05.280 --> 33:08.680
And I mean, that's a wonderful thing, like even right now, like, you don't really know

33:08.680 --> 33:13.040
what I'm going to say next, you know, and to me, that's very interesting.

33:13.040 --> 33:16.040
That's the beauty of it.

33:16.040 --> 33:21.320
If I know more predictably what you're going to do in a conversation, it's fine.

33:21.320 --> 33:25.760
And I have plenty of conversations like that, but to me, I'd always gravitate towards, you

33:25.760 --> 33:32.880
know, exploring the unpredictable a little bit rather than the comfort of predictability.

33:32.880 --> 33:36.600
But that's an unusual thing, I think, in our culture, what most people would rather trade

33:36.600 --> 33:42.300
the comfort of predictability for the unknown.

33:42.300 --> 33:47.520
But I think that's our real adventure is to just take a step into that.

33:47.520 --> 33:49.200
And that's what we're dealing with right now.

33:49.200 --> 33:52.560
Like I said before, no one wants to admit that we don't know what's going to happen.

33:52.560 --> 33:57.680
And in a way, that makes life very interesting to not know what's going to happen.

33:57.680 --> 34:02.840
Well, it could be more boring than really, I mean, we want, we say we want predictability,

34:02.840 --> 34:04.560
but we don't really want it.

34:04.560 --> 34:08.760
Who would, I mean, at the same time, now we're complaining about, oh, every day, it's like

34:08.760 --> 34:13.360
Groundhog Day, every day is the same, you know, and it's like, well, there, you wanted

34:13.360 --> 34:17.000
predictability, now you got it completely.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.400
That's not as much fun as you thought it was going to be, is it?

34:20.400 --> 34:27.640
You know, we want that element of adventure and unpredictability and the universe offers

34:27.640 --> 34:28.640
us that.

34:28.640 --> 34:30.040
I mean, that's the thing about nature.

34:30.040 --> 34:35.320
It's always been, you know, you think you're going to get something and it throws you a

34:35.320 --> 34:37.160
curve all the time.

34:37.160 --> 34:41.920
Yeah, this podcasting has been a very interesting experience about what you're talking about,

34:41.920 --> 34:48.240
but I'm mostly interested in people who, again, as you said, I don't know what they're going

34:48.240 --> 34:49.240
to talk about.

34:49.240 --> 34:55.240
Like I had John McAfee a couple episodes back on the podcast, had no idea what he was going

34:55.240 --> 34:56.240
to say.

34:56.240 --> 35:01.960
He's a fugitive now and he started drinking right off the bat and he said, this is what

35:01.960 --> 35:02.960
I'm going to be.

35:02.960 --> 35:03.960
I'm like, awesome.

35:03.960 --> 35:06.880
I'm looking forward to see what's coming out of this.

35:06.880 --> 35:13.080
But there are some people who they ask for questions beforehand before coming to the

35:13.080 --> 35:15.520
show and I'm like, I don't know what I'm going to ask you.

35:15.520 --> 35:18.740
I'm going to ask you the first question and then something comes to my mind.

35:18.740 --> 35:23.200
I'm going to ask you that and then maybe some kind of a short rant come to my mind.

35:23.200 --> 35:27.640
I'm going to say that and this is how it's going to be.

35:27.640 --> 35:34.200
But some people are very, very afraid of stepping into the unknown and I think that is exactly

35:34.200 --> 35:39.360
the point that I keep telling people around me who we usually gather a small group of

35:39.360 --> 35:43.040
people experimenting with psychedelics.

35:43.040 --> 35:45.160
I've been doing it for more than 10 years.

35:45.160 --> 35:46.960
These guys have been doing it for a few years.

35:46.960 --> 35:54.360
So it's really awesome for me to just be there available to, as they're saying, tie the knots

35:54.360 --> 35:59.320
or open some doors that they didn't even know existed through conversation and creating

35:59.320 --> 36:05.560
momentary temporarily order out of chaos and then move back to the chaos.

36:05.560 --> 36:10.760
So it's all about, as I'm telling them, hey, whatever you're afraid of the most, that is

36:10.760 --> 36:15.760
your indicator to go right through it, face it right away.

36:15.760 --> 36:19.680
And Joseph Campbell also, I came across a quote saying, the cave you're afraid of the

36:19.680 --> 36:23.360
most has the treasure that you seek.

36:23.360 --> 36:30.360
But it seems like people are paralyzed by fear and they're not even willing to give

36:30.360 --> 36:33.520
it a shot.

36:33.520 --> 36:35.600
How would they snap out of it?

36:35.600 --> 36:40.920
Yeah, if you get into some of the mythology, the grail myths, and there's an old saying

36:40.920 --> 36:46.720
that the grail castle is always down the road to the left.

36:46.720 --> 36:51.380
And I think one of the meanings of that is like, look, this adventure, dealing with life

36:51.380 --> 36:55.560
as an adventure, it's always right there in front of you.

36:55.560 --> 36:57.000
But it's a terrifying choice.

36:57.000 --> 37:05.040
And I think it was Kierkegaard who said that just the idea of being free, just the idea

37:05.040 --> 37:09.600
that right now I could say or do something like anything, like that's so overwhelming

37:09.600 --> 37:14.040
for people that they would really choose to not indulge at all.

37:14.040 --> 37:16.000
They don't want to play the game.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.920
It's too terrifying.

37:17.920 --> 37:23.760
And so we choose not to choose.

37:23.760 --> 37:30.440
We get into these very predictable social roles that it's very comforting and I can

37:30.440 --> 37:31.440
understand it.

37:31.440 --> 37:37.600
There are some days I think, wow, man, I would really like to just live a normal life.

37:37.600 --> 37:43.600
Not have opened this jar of consciousness and existence and be an accountant or sell

37:43.600 --> 37:50.800
insurance and take the whole thing seriously and I have moments like this, I won't kid

37:50.800 --> 37:53.200
you that I don't.

37:53.200 --> 37:55.280
So I can empathize.

37:55.280 --> 38:03.520
That kind of existence, I think it's quote normal for people.

38:03.520 --> 38:08.160
I think the vast majority of our species, I think that's the path we choose and it's

38:08.160 --> 38:15.720
the anomalies like you are just like, let's open the door of chaos and let's sit in really

38:15.720 --> 38:21.640
interesting anticipation what's going to happen next because I don't know and you don't know.

38:21.640 --> 38:22.640
No one knows.

38:22.640 --> 38:30.680
That's what makes the whole thing so fascinating to me.

38:30.680 --> 38:35.600
And I think that the kind of adventurous types in terms of evolution, I think there's always

38:35.600 --> 38:41.760
been maybe 10% or less of the adventurous types to keep existence interesting but the

38:41.760 --> 38:47.640
vast majority are the types that just go down that path that a thousand other people have

38:47.640 --> 38:52.480
taken and that's good for the species in a way, I suppose.

38:52.480 --> 38:55.240
That's why people like me marry people like my wife.

38:55.240 --> 38:56.240
She keeps me grounded.

38:56.240 --> 39:03.120
If I married someone like me, I would be sleeping on the side of a river somewhere, hanging

39:03.120 --> 39:07.360
out in the woods.

39:07.360 --> 39:14.600
I can appreciate a certain type of grounding but I think even for those types, you can

39:14.600 --> 39:18.320
open the door a little bit, have a little bit of an adventure.

39:18.320 --> 39:22.080
You don't have to go trip and completely lose your identity.

39:22.080 --> 39:32.600
You can have small versions of it and sometimes I think that works too.

39:32.600 --> 39:37.120
We talked about institutions and professors and PhDs and all that.

39:37.120 --> 39:44.560
One of the trends that keep coming up in the past few episodes is how these institutions

39:44.560 --> 39:49.840
have monopolized resources for specific fields to be studied.

39:49.840 --> 39:56.400
Use physics as an example that for decades supposedly, the only field that money would

39:56.400 --> 39:58.600
have gone to is string theory.

39:58.600 --> 40:00.880
So it didn't matter how good of an argument you had.

40:00.880 --> 40:03.360
It didn't matter what good of a research you wanted to do.

40:03.360 --> 40:09.440
If it was not string theory, it would have been shunned because the apparatus of that

40:09.440 --> 40:15.960
institution had capitalized on string theory and this is the answer again, certainty.

40:15.960 --> 40:22.320
So we're talking about consciousness as understanding it being basically the most important thing

40:22.320 --> 40:29.900
that we can even ponder about or begin to understand it but how would that be possible

40:29.900 --> 40:31.640
in this kind of a situation?

40:31.640 --> 40:36.600
If you go to the biggest universities, they're like, we want to study consciousness, okay,

40:36.600 --> 40:37.600
what it's all about?

40:37.600 --> 40:40.600
We don't know.

40:40.600 --> 40:47.560
Yeah, because the fundamentals behind the university is that there's an answer and

40:47.560 --> 40:51.000
that we'll give you an answer and that students are paying for an answer.

40:51.000 --> 40:55.440
I mean, when I start my consciousness class every semester, I come out and tell them like,

40:55.440 --> 40:59.200
look, I'm going to babble on and there's going to be a lot of sounds coming out of my mouth

40:59.200 --> 41:04.840
but in the end, no one has a clue about what consciousness really is.

41:04.840 --> 41:09.160
And that to me is the adventurous part of this class and we get to admit that it's still

41:09.160 --> 41:10.160
fun to talk about.

41:10.160 --> 41:13.520
As I always say, the Tao Te Ching comes right out and says, look, anything I say isn't the

41:13.520 --> 41:17.840
true Tao but what the heck, I'm going to talk about it anyway.

41:17.840 --> 41:22.280
And so that's what we do but academia doesn't want to hear that.

41:22.280 --> 41:28.520
So I kind of sneak mine in but the truth is, you know, academia wants results and results

41:28.520 --> 41:32.880
mean it's the same thing I was talking about early on when I said we don't want to admit

41:32.880 --> 41:34.560
that we don't know.

41:34.560 --> 41:39.280
To be an honest institution, so many fields in physics and philosophy should just come

41:39.280 --> 41:43.400
out and say, look, there's stuff we really don't know but that doesn't sell well.

41:43.400 --> 41:47.960
A much better, you know, it's much easier to sell a package that, look, we know this

41:47.960 --> 41:53.320
stuff and here's the package of knowledge and if you pay this money for a tuition, you're

41:53.320 --> 41:55.200
going to come out feeling like you know something.

41:55.200 --> 41:58.920
And I've told my students for years, when you get your PhD, you should have an overwhelming

41:58.920 --> 42:01.400
sensation of how little you know.

42:01.400 --> 42:04.760
You should recognize that there's so little that you know.

42:04.760 --> 42:09.040
You should feel overwhelmingly ignorant.

42:09.040 --> 42:12.640
That's not a great sell for people, you know.

42:12.640 --> 42:14.600
That's not a like pep talk.

42:14.600 --> 42:18.880
People don't want to like, oh, that's not like your speech to get people in the graduate

42:18.880 --> 42:19.880
school.

42:19.880 --> 42:24.620
You know, the thinking mind is obsessed with this notion that we can know and the universe

42:24.620 --> 42:25.620
is knowable.

42:25.620 --> 42:29.200
You know, I think Einstein said, you know, the most incomprehensible thing about the

42:29.200 --> 42:33.560
universe is that it's comprehensible and I'm like, no, it isn't.

42:33.560 --> 42:35.560
It's not.

42:35.560 --> 42:37.360
And thinking like it's very frustrating.

42:37.360 --> 42:38.360
It may not be.

42:38.360 --> 42:40.840
I'm not saying that I know with certainty that it isn't.

42:40.840 --> 42:43.260
I just question whether it is.

42:43.260 --> 42:45.400
Maybe it isn't.

42:45.400 --> 42:49.120
And that maybe is enough for some people, it turns them off, I think.

42:49.120 --> 42:54.600
Really the most interesting argument in favor of predictability and orderly nature of universe

42:54.600 --> 42:59.120
to me is coming from people who are working on artificial intelligence and algorithms.

42:59.120 --> 43:05.480
And their argument is that anything that is not quantifiable is therefore chaotic.

43:05.480 --> 43:12.000
But philosophically speaking, if we digitize everything and allow the processing power

43:12.000 --> 43:16.280
to be able to process it, which would be artificial general intelligence, for example, even the

43:16.280 --> 43:21.520
waves of the ocean and the flux of bird flying would be predictable and measurable.

43:21.520 --> 43:25.040
So that is a very interesting argument.

43:25.040 --> 43:31.600
But again, there is no certainty that that is the answer either.

43:31.600 --> 43:37.960
The artificial intelligence is such an interesting field because I think in some ways they make

43:37.960 --> 43:43.360
the mistake the most explicitly in the sense that they're creating artificial minds.

43:43.360 --> 43:45.960
And just admit it, you're creating artificial thinking minds.

43:45.960 --> 43:50.600
So you're taking the thinking mind, the element of it's not consciousness.

43:50.600 --> 43:55.880
So in my class, I teach a class on artificial intelligence and this is one of the main points

43:55.880 --> 44:01.600
of the class is like, we may replicate the thinking mind and in fact, we've already replicated

44:01.600 --> 44:02.600
the thinking mind.

44:02.600 --> 44:06.180
And the more the thinking mind becomes replicated, the more predictable.

44:06.180 --> 44:11.720
There are certain things about the thinking mind that are incredibly predictable.

44:11.720 --> 44:13.240
But that's it.

44:13.240 --> 44:18.200
We're not replicating consciousness and we're not replicating and it's such an interesting

44:18.200 --> 44:19.200
thing.

44:19.200 --> 44:26.480
I can appreciate people who would have such an incredible goal that we could in principle

44:26.480 --> 44:33.200
predict the flight changes in a flock of birds or the way the ocean, the waves, something

44:33.200 --> 44:37.040
so fundamentally unpredictable.

44:37.040 --> 44:42.200
My gut, which who knows how fine tuned that is, but I would say it's probably never going

44:42.200 --> 44:43.200
to happen.

44:43.200 --> 44:48.240
But I do also find it very interesting that someone would hold that position.

44:48.240 --> 44:53.640
To me, that's a fascinating kind of adventure too, the kind of thing, maybe we could predict

44:53.640 --> 44:56.160
the unpredictable.

44:56.160 --> 45:02.720
I think it's also the terminology too, because with AI, actually I had the gentleman who

45:02.720 --> 45:07.760
coined the term along with two other people, Peter Voss on the podcast, he coined the term

45:07.760 --> 45:14.560
artificial intelligence in early 90s and artificial general intelligence, AGI is what he coined.

45:14.560 --> 45:21.040
But I like to think of that A as not artificial but augmented intelligence, because there

45:21.040 --> 45:29.680
is no need to recreate a machine that is working in the way that our human brain does.

45:29.680 --> 45:37.160
But augmenting it to be able to experience in a more expanded kind of a way is a very

45:37.160 --> 45:42.120
interesting notion to me and especially now, are you familiar with Neuralink, Elon Musk's?

45:42.120 --> 45:43.120
Yes.

45:43.120 --> 45:50.080
So, what do you think about that?

45:50.080 --> 45:51.320
Because that's what it does.

45:51.320 --> 46:00.600
His whole thing is that you put this implantable human computer interface to expand the capability

46:00.600 --> 46:07.560
of your brain and heal the parts of it that are damaged, therefore you'll be able to receive

46:07.560 --> 46:13.800
the information at a rate that will be comparable to an AI system, because his argument is that

46:13.800 --> 46:18.360
there is no way that we can compete with these machines, which I agree with in a sense that

46:18.360 --> 46:28.240
we are creating a completely non-Darwinian kind of an event here.

46:28.240 --> 46:33.040
What are your thoughts about that?

46:33.040 --> 46:38.680
I would guess that what's going to happen is that to the extent that we figure out the

46:38.680 --> 46:42.920
brain and we've done a great job in terms of figuring out the thinking mind, fields

46:42.920 --> 46:48.480
of psychology, we've mapped out hundreds of different flaws the thinking mind is susceptible

46:48.480 --> 46:52.840
to and so one of the nice things, like you said, we could augment this and we can come

46:52.840 --> 46:57.240
up with a better version of the thinking mind, one that's not going to make all the flaws

46:57.240 --> 47:01.600
that the human mind does and at the same time we can also go in and tweak the human brain

47:01.600 --> 47:04.200
and kind of upgrade it.

47:04.200 --> 47:08.760
My guess is though these are all going to be really significant in terms of how we think

47:08.760 --> 47:09.760
about the world.

47:09.760 --> 47:15.960
I don't see them as doing anything that's going to genuinely expand actual consciousness.

47:15.960 --> 47:23.880
I'm not convinced and there's no science behind this except to say I'm still not terribly

47:23.880 --> 47:28.520
convinced that the brain alone gives rise to consciousness and so then no matter how

47:28.520 --> 47:32.480
much you tweak the brain, yes, it may give us insights, we may be able to think faster,

47:32.480 --> 47:40.840
we may be able to even hold more than one thought at a time but the fundamentals of

47:40.840 --> 47:45.240
actual consciousness experience, I just don't see it happening but I absolutely could be

47:45.240 --> 47:46.240
wrong.

47:46.240 --> 47:50.520
In fact, it's one of those things that would be really fascinating and I would be happy

47:50.520 --> 47:59.800
to admit like I was wrong, I mean if they ever come up with a theory of consciousness,

47:59.800 --> 48:05.760
I would be the first person to happily say I was wrong, like wow, they figured out something

48:05.760 --> 48:11.280
that I was so convinced was unable to ever be figured out and so …

48:11.280 --> 48:19.800
A theory of consciousness sounds to me like trying to make sense out of something that

48:19.800 --> 48:26.920
is unknowable by design because it includes everything and anything and all of its expressions

48:26.920 --> 48:36.200
and it just like you try to add with current level of our understanding, try to predict

48:36.200 --> 48:40.800
if you pour water on the ground, which direction would it go to and at what rate would it be

48:40.800 --> 48:44.800
absorbed?

48:44.800 --> 48:50.000
Or even something as simple as what is it going to rain in the next 15 minutes?

48:50.000 --> 48:57.640
Again, it's that war on nature, war in the sense that we're trying to figure it out,

48:57.640 --> 49:05.120
predict it so we can ultimately control it and so far we haven't won, we haven't done

49:05.120 --> 49:12.800
very well in it but we could change things around, I don't know.

49:12.800 --> 49:18.120
The theories in consciousness right now, I mean none of them even come close, I mean

49:18.120 --> 49:23.400
it's almost a contradiction to talk about a theory of consciousness because by its very

49:23.400 --> 49:28.480
definition a theory is something that the mind does, they're limited to the thinking

49:28.480 --> 49:37.160
mind and the thinking mind is just so, you know, it's so small and it can think in one

49:37.160 --> 49:40.880
thing at a time and that's the way the thinking mind is but everything's happening at the

49:40.880 --> 49:47.000
universe all at once, you know, and I mean even right now, I mean my thinking mind is

49:47.000 --> 49:52.200
processing maybe one thousandth, probably far less than that of all the things like

49:52.200 --> 49:56.840
somehow I'm doing my blood chemistry, I'm beating my heart, I'm doing an infinite amount

49:56.840 --> 50:02.440
of operations right now and on top of it is a small little thinking mind, you know, it

50:02.440 --> 50:08.040
can't even become aware of the workings of what's going on in my own body and yet I'm

50:08.040 --> 50:14.680
supposed to figure out the mysteries of the universe, so I don't know.

50:14.680 --> 50:20.760
What are some of the theories of consciousness?

50:20.760 --> 50:26.520
You know, there's a couple of really popular theories, Tononi and my favorite, you know,

50:26.520 --> 50:33.800
this is an old one going back to Daniel Dennett and they're all interesting theories but

50:33.800 --> 50:39.780
there are more theories about the thinking mind and they do a very good job of showing

50:39.780 --> 50:47.340
how the thinking mind processes information and all this but none of them come close to

50:47.340 --> 50:52.680
explaining what in philosophy is called the hard problem which is really just consciousness

50:52.680 --> 51:00.120
itself and there isn't even a theory that comes close to dealing with the hard problem,

51:00.120 --> 51:03.900
you know, and that's because the hard problem isn't the hard problem, the hard problem may

51:03.900 --> 51:08.840
be the impossible problem when it comes to the thinking mind, you know, and we have this

51:08.840 --> 51:13.720
terrible thinking problem in our country and the world is not necessarily like this, there

51:13.720 --> 51:18.680
are other places in the world they don't think as much as we do and they don't think as much

51:18.680 --> 51:22.960
about thinking as we do, you know, so it's not so much that we think all the time but

51:22.960 --> 51:27.880
we think quite a bit about our thinking, you know, and it sets us on this path like if

51:27.880 --> 51:33.120
we just think enough we'll figure this out and you can see all the scientists rushing

51:33.120 --> 51:38.800
to come up with a cure and, you know, a vaccine or everyone fighting it out because they really

51:38.800 --> 51:44.880
think that what's going on right now is a thinking problem and if you just think enough

51:44.880 --> 51:51.280
thinking problems will be solved but that's just a hypothesis, it may not be a thinking

51:51.280 --> 51:58.280
problem at all, maybe something, you know, like Einstein's quote about, you know, the

51:58.280 --> 52:00.920
level of analysis that got us into this problem isn't going to get us out.

52:00.920 --> 52:10.680
I mean, really maybe the way out is not the way we came in and so, you know, maybe we

52:10.680 --> 52:18.480
have to, you know, recognize the limitations of the thinking mind and kind of maybe there's

52:18.480 --> 52:24.000
other options to thinking, thinking our way out of this and people say, I mean, it's such

52:24.000 --> 52:30.320
an alien, it's such a foreign and strange way to propose the solution to a problem because

52:30.320 --> 52:36.040
we're so taught, we're so inculturated, so socialized to believe that thinking is the

52:36.040 --> 52:45.880
way out of every problem that we can't even conceptualize a scenario where thinking wasn't

52:45.880 --> 52:51.800
the answer and there's this wonderful culture and I wish I could remember a little bit more

52:51.800 --> 52:54.920
in terms of where the location, a very small culture, in fact, on the verge of extinction.

52:54.920 --> 53:03.280
I don't know, maybe I brought it up last time, I can't remember and they are a culture that

53:03.280 --> 53:08.680
probably is our best example on the planet of a culture who they simply don't think,

53:08.680 --> 53:12.320
they don't think the way we, they don't even use language, they sing.

53:12.320 --> 53:17.520
So the way they communicate is, in essence, by like whistling a tune or humming a couple

53:17.520 --> 53:21.320
lines, I mean, that's the way they communicate.

53:21.320 --> 53:22.320
Which part of the world?

53:22.320 --> 53:30.760
Ah, you know, I wish I could, I'm so bad with details like that, it's not language, but

53:30.760 --> 53:34.120
the funny thing is you can't even pronounce their culture correctly because to pronounce

53:34.120 --> 53:37.240
their culture correctly, you have to have the right intonation.

53:37.240 --> 53:41.360
So you know, and intonation is everything which was all right-brained and so it's almost

53:41.360 --> 53:44.960
like this one little place on the planet and they had 400 people and I think they're down

53:44.960 --> 53:48.540
to 200, so it's like they're all virtually extinct.

53:48.540 --> 53:53.480
But they had so little need for the past and the future, I'll send you the YouTube clip

53:53.480 --> 53:56.880
on this because it's a wonderful YouTube clip to watch and it was a missionary who went

53:56.880 --> 53:59.640
there to convert them to Christianity.

53:59.640 --> 54:05.040
And what we discovered is when he started talking about the past, they had no need for

54:05.040 --> 54:08.040
the past and they had no need for the future.

54:08.040 --> 54:11.760
So they're like, what are you so worried about this guy, if he's long been dead, what do

54:11.760 --> 54:15.400
you, and then what do you care about heaven, heaven's the thing that's going to happen.

54:15.400 --> 54:22.640
They just couldn't understand how someone would put the past and the future over the

54:22.640 --> 54:24.280
present moment.

54:24.280 --> 54:28.600
And that's the wonderful thing about, and I mentioned how on the weekends I tried to,

54:28.600 --> 54:34.360
to the best that I can, process reality with something other than the thinking mind and

54:34.360 --> 54:40.560
when you do this, you're immediately thrown into the present moment and wonderful, amazing

54:40.560 --> 54:43.480
thing about the present moment is there's no problems.

54:43.480 --> 54:46.240
And these individuals were described as the happiest people on the planet.

54:46.240 --> 54:47.840
They were almost continuously smart.

54:47.840 --> 54:56.040
They were just joyful because what could be more joyful than losing the thinking mind?

54:56.040 --> 55:00.160
You know, I mean, and now again, we don't necessarily want to just shut that all off

55:00.160 --> 55:04.280
because the thinking mind can be a very good tool when we want to turn it on.

55:04.280 --> 55:08.440
And there's probably times when we could probably solve certain problems with it, it would be

55:08.440 --> 55:09.720
very helpful.

55:09.720 --> 55:13.520
Our problem is we think that the thinking mind is the answer to every, so we're like

55:13.520 --> 55:18.280
turning it up to 11, you know, like that amp on spinal, like we're like, we want to crank

55:18.280 --> 55:23.240
it up like past, you know, even its own limitations.

55:23.240 --> 55:26.820
And because we're so convinced that if we just think, we will eventually think our way

55:26.820 --> 55:28.960
out of this mess.

55:28.960 --> 55:31.560
And I don't, not sure we will.

55:31.560 --> 55:36.800
I think, you know, maybe these are these moments, you know, what would happen?

55:36.800 --> 55:42.320
Think about the possibilities now, what would happen if people recognize the opportunity

55:42.320 --> 55:51.120
of the situation and they started having time that was quiet, meditative, it could be disastrous

55:51.120 --> 55:53.700
in a way for the thinking mind.

55:53.700 --> 55:58.720
People may realize that they don't need their jobs as much as they thought they did.

55:58.720 --> 56:01.220
They don't need, they don't need the nine to five life.

56:01.220 --> 56:04.320
They don't need the social identities that have been thrown on them.

56:04.320 --> 56:09.760
Who knows how many people may wake up to this idea that this life that they have been living

56:09.760 --> 56:14.360
was a fiction, was a collective fiction that was thrown on them.

56:14.360 --> 56:18.000
You know, sometimes, like you said, since birth, people are thrown and all of a sudden

56:18.000 --> 56:21.320
they may realize, look, I don't need this.

56:21.320 --> 56:25.600
I don't need, you know, I don't need anything else except exactly what's happening right

56:25.600 --> 56:26.600
now.

56:26.600 --> 56:29.320
And that's what that culture seems exemplify.

56:29.320 --> 56:32.680
They were just so, they were so pleased with what was happening at the present moment.

56:32.680 --> 56:36.640
They found that nothing else was actually necessary.

56:36.640 --> 56:44.680
And that's a very dangerous thing in a culture that wants to control and wants to, because

56:44.680 --> 56:46.680
you can't control someone in the present moment.

56:46.680 --> 56:51.560
A person who's in the present moment is absolutely happy with everything that they have.

56:51.560 --> 56:56.680
The only way I can control you is if I get you to believe you need something and then

56:56.680 --> 56:59.600
you'll do certain things to get that.

56:59.600 --> 57:03.720
Now, you know, what's, it just came to my mind.

57:03.720 --> 57:10.400
What is really interesting for me to try to understand is whether or not at some point

57:10.400 --> 57:15.800
in our history, there were a group of people who realize exactly what you're talking about,

57:15.800 --> 57:22.120
that we need to depend people on certain products and services based on past and future, and

57:22.120 --> 57:26.920
we have to get them away from the present, which suggests to me if there were people

57:26.920 --> 57:29.760
like that, they were enlightened themselves.

57:29.760 --> 57:32.000
They just realized that, hey, we know what's going on.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.680
We just want to enslave everyone else.

57:34.680 --> 57:43.120
Do you think there was a group of people or civilization at some point that they set basically

57:43.120 --> 57:49.600
in motion this apparatus that had evolved to become what we are calling our civilization

57:49.600 --> 57:50.600
today?

57:50.600 --> 57:57.080
It's an interesting spec, I don't know.

57:57.080 --> 58:00.600
Sometimes I think those types, again, like I said, the controlling types that do seem

58:00.600 --> 58:06.480
to gravitate towards our leaders and the ones who, you know, seem to be controlling the

58:06.480 --> 58:13.160
show in so many superficial ways, you know, it's a very interesting question and sometimes

58:13.160 --> 58:17.080
you do want to sort of get into their skull and figure out what's going on.

58:17.080 --> 58:21.560
Like, do you really know what's going on with all this stuff or are you just as blind

58:21.560 --> 58:23.280
to it as everyone else?

58:23.280 --> 58:28.120
I mean, it's a fascinating, you know, kind of trick of empathy just to see if you can

58:28.120 --> 58:30.120
get into their world.

58:30.120 --> 58:31.120
I don't know.

58:31.120 --> 58:38.120
I think either way, it would be interesting, you know.

58:38.120 --> 58:45.040
Certainly our enlightened, you know, this idea, I mean, it didn't do a lot for progress.

58:45.040 --> 58:49.520
This idea that societies are going to, we'll invent better tools and we'll invent better,

58:49.520 --> 58:56.160
you know, cars and I mean, to have this idea, like always wanting that next better thing.

58:56.160 --> 58:57.160
Yeah.

58:57.160 --> 59:05.360
You know, I mean, maybe that's a genetic trait that we're programmed in a way or if we're

59:05.360 --> 59:10.680
not programmed, we're very susceptible to the idea that the next better thing is genuinely

59:10.680 --> 59:11.680
possible.

59:11.680 --> 59:15.920
Don't you see it as a necessity in order to survive?

59:15.920 --> 59:20.880
Because I actually had this conversation yesterday that we evolved with our technology because

59:20.880 --> 59:26.120
one group of our ancestors, they invented the wheel and discovered fire and the other

59:26.120 --> 59:28.600
group look at them and like, oh, they have those.

59:28.600 --> 59:32.480
We got to build them a little better so we can defeat them.

59:32.480 --> 59:37.160
And this feedback loop went on and on and on and on, which to me suggests that wars

59:37.160 --> 59:44.640
and conflicts themselves are as natural as humanity itself because it has pushed us forward

59:44.640 --> 59:46.360
to where we are today.

59:46.360 --> 59:47.360
Yeah.

59:47.360 --> 59:49.560
Have you read the book Sapiens?

59:49.560 --> 59:52.360
Yes, by Nuvall Harari.

59:52.360 --> 59:53.360
Yeah.

59:53.360 --> 59:54.360
Yeah.

59:54.360 --> 59:59.600
I mean, and I love his description of how, you know, long the planet has been around

59:59.600 --> 01:00:04.360
and human beings, I mean, we act like we own this place, you know, we've been here such

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:08.880
a fraction of a fraction of it, you know, we haven't even unpacked our stuff.

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:12.400
We've just arrived and we act like we've been here forever.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:16.460
And then you take a look at the thinking mind, you know, that cognitive revolution that happened

01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:19.840
about 40,000 years ago with the Homo sapiens.

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:25.080
And it's very possible that the whole thing you're talking about could have been behind

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.080
the cognitive revolution.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:29.880
It's just this idea that I need something better, a better tool, a better weapon.

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:34.160
And then, and that's the reason, like, literally, we, this idea that I could be a better self,

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:39.600
or I could have a better something, in a way we owe our existence to it.

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.640
Because if you look around, all you see are Homo sapiens.

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:46.280
You don't see Neanderthal, you don't see any of the other species of humans that were walking

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:47.280
up.

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:48.280
We did away with all of them.

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:51.280
You know, we annihilated all of them.

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.280
So we won.

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:57.120
And we won because maybe this program of like, look, I can be a better me and I could have

01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:02.560
more, you know, and you can feel that and it's sort of an ironic, you know, another

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:09.160
guitar or another car or another, you know, slightly bigger house and you can, it's so

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:14.480
interesting because in a way you can intellectually know that you don't need that, but you still

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:15.480
feel it.

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:18.880
And it's like, it's like part of us, you know, part of our species.

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:23.600
So instead of just being completely critical of it, sometimes I am grateful for it because

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:29.800
I'm like, look, you know, here I am, you know, I was having this discussion with my son and

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:33.800
we were talking about like, and he got very, he was like, what would have happened if Neanderthals

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:34.800
had won?

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:37.200
I'm like, he's like, would I still be me?

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:44.680
I'm like, I don't know, you know, no, probably not.

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:50.240
So you know, so in a way we can criticize the need for more, but in another way, I think

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:51.440
we can be grateful for it.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:55.400
The problem is this need for more has outlived itself.

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:56.760
It's outlived its usefulness.

01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:00.560
You know, I mean, we've kind of, we've run it up to the point that people are going to

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:02.240
be trillionaires now.

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:07.560
I mean, that you could see that need for more is just like, do we really need to be a trillionaire?

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:13.440
I mean, you know, who needs, you know, it's almost kind of like embarrassing, you know,

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:15.760
I mean, do you really need that?

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:18.360
I mean, how much, how many things do you need?

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:23.320
And you know, I'm not being, I mean, I've got, you know, six guitars, do I really need

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:24.320
six guitars?

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:28.880
And people could say, so people could throw this on me and I'd say, no, I don't really,

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:34.320
I don't need them, but you know, so it's probably outlived itself.

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:38.360
And I think as a species where we're going to be slow, I mean, people always think, well,

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:39.760
what's happening this year?

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:44.800
But you know, our species, when you, it goes in thousands, tens of thousands of years,

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:52.720
it may take us another thousand years before we recognize these impulses and the direction

01:02:52.720 --> 01:03:01.440
to culture could really, you know, take that, that could bring about some substantive changes.

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:10.160
So in the context of human evolution and technological evolution, I think the individual who not

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:16.960
only understood it better than most, but he made it into one of the masterpieces of our

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:25.120
civilization 2001 space Odyssey, Stanley Kubrick, that the monkey finds a bone and realize that

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.640
it can crush the skull.

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:31.760
The first thing it does, it hunts to feed its family.

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:37.760
But the second thing it does, it kills the leader of the other monkey group to preserve

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:41.640
the water, the water supply for themselves.

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.600
And then the bone goes up and turn into a rocket.

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:48.320
It's just a masterpiece in the level that I think most people don't even understand

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:53.800
what that movie is talking about, that even just the beginning of it, that first 20 minutes.

01:03:53.800 --> 01:04:00.240
They show that I show that in class at the beginning of my consciousness class, because

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:05.520
I think it's a wonderful example, the birth of the thinking mind, you know, and you see

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:07.880
one of our ancestors in their first thought.

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:12.560
And like you said, you know, it becomes practical, and it becomes making things better.

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:16.440
And so yeah, hey, there's this I finally found a tool and it is interesting, because even

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:18.400
in the movie, they got it right.

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:21.720
And this is what a thing in McGilchrist talks about how the left brain controls the right

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:22.720
hand.

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:23.720
And of course, most of us are right handed.

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:28.560
And that's how we control manipulate the world, you know, and we use things for purposes that

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:32.560
they were not intended for, you know, this is a bone, but the left brain says, well,

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:33.560
it's not a bone.

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:34.560
It's a weapon.

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:38.720
And all of a sudden, then you go and you know, you figured out how to, you know, it's a tool

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:43.280
and now I can feed my family and you're right, you know, that two of the biggest things,

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.760
you know, take care of my needs and make my life better.

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:53.040
But then also this kind of, you know, competition for resources, you know, you stole my watering

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:58.760
hole and now he got that monkey got to go back and take back the watering hole.

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:03.360
And and it did it through absolute violence, it was an incredibly violent scene.

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:06.760
And so it's kind of like this message, like, okay, what was the first thing the thinking

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:08.620
mind did?

01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:12.320
Violence was the first thing and violence was the second thing.

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:17.560
And so thinking mind is like, you know, it's an extremely powerful tool, but we also have

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:25.440
to realize its origins, you know, and the first thing the thinking mind did was take

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:30.760
care of thyself, you know, that's what it did and took care of the self.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:35.200
And so maybe that was the birth of the, when we started, you know, where did the self come,

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:37.200
when did it come online?

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:40.440
You know, and so when I talk to consciousness researchers, that's the first thing I want

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:46.240
to say, okay, your theory of consciousness, that you, when did it, when did it come online?

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:49.560
So if we look at humans, and we've been on the planet for about two and a half million

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:54.120
years, and then it's only this short time ago that we started thinking, but were we

01:05:54.120 --> 01:06:00.720
conscious before we started thinking, you know, so those like in the movie that beginning

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:03.040
so, I mean, they were they conscious?

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:08.200
Well, of course they were conscious, they just weren't thinking, thinking added a certain

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:13.360
element, a new type of consciousness, but they were certainly consciousness before then

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:17.440
and that's the thing that consciousness theories are not addressing, they're not addressing,

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:21.820
you know, well, what kind of consciousness is a mouse experiencing, you know, what kind

01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:26.160
of consciousness is a dog experience, you know, or all the other mammals or any other

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:28.200
thing on the planet, perhaps.

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:33.760
I mean, that's changing a little bit now with all the panpsychism stuff, but it's been a

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:36.200
really slow change.

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:41.320
And so, but yeah, it's funny you talk about that, because that beginning to 2001, I've

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:44.880
been showing that in class and the students just, they get blown away with it.

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:51.440
I'm like, look, this is a possible way, this is a possible scenario of how humans with

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:56.400
their first thought, you know, and what did we think, you know?

01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:00.160
It's also interesting to contemplate what happened to the group of monkey who lost their

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:05.640
leader getting killed by that bone, did they went and they found another bone, but they

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:09.600
put like a thorn on the top of it, they upgraded it.

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:13.680
Now they killed that group and the remainder of that group, they upgrade the weapon and

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:14.680
so on and so forth.

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:19.120
Oh, I'm sure that and that's exactly what, like when a bone gets thrown into the sky

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:23.760
and it turns into, I mean, that's a real good representation of that we're playing the same

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:28.200
game, we just have fancier tools to do it with.

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:31.360
And we're doing it in probably not as violent a ways.

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:37.000
And so, you know, when we out text someone, or we, you know, show them up at work, or

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:42.360
we come up with a better program or, you know, these are like same versions of it, but you

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:47.720
know, far less violent in an explicit way, but it's the same game.

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:53.080
And it's always centered around the self, you know, people don't come up with, like

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:57.720
I don't go out to try to reinvent something so I can give it to someone else.

01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:03.160
I mean, I wonder when we reinvent, like we're trying to invent stuff to improve our situation.

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:07.800
Like right now, you know, why are we really suddenly, people are trying to come up with

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:09.680
a vaccine for the coronavirus.

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:10.680
Well, why?

01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:12.720
Because we're intellectually interested in it?

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:18.400
No, you know, we're doing it, you know, and that same level, we're trying to come up with

01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:23.680
a better weapon, a better bone with, you know, a thorn in it, so it works more effectively.

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:26.520
Yeah, it's interesting.

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:32.240
One part of this whole equation with respect to coronavirus is that the virus could have

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:37.320
escaped the lab doesn't mean that it was bioengineered, it just means that they were, as you said,

01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:42.800
they had intellectual curiosity and interest in studying it and upgrading it.

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:47.840
And because they are not taking as much care about their facilities in Wuhan, for example,

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:50.400
in China, it just escaped the lab.

01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:51.400
Yeah.

01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:52.400
It's possible.

01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:56.400
A lesson we should have learned from Jurassic Park.

01:08:56.400 --> 01:09:02.880
I mean, the whole, you know, movie said to run this, nature finds a way and we think

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:04.520
we can contain it within the lab.

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:10.920
But you know, it's a very arrogant egotistical thing and we can't control it and it finds

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:16.080
a way and no matter how many precautions we take and, you know, try to control things,

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:18.840
I mean, you can't even control drugs in prison.

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:23.260
And so you think, well, here's a system of ultimate control, you know, but they, drugs

01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:28.180
are still, they get into the system and then we think we're going to control nature.

01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:33.760
And so who knows what that scenario was, but you know, it's certainly possible.

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:39.840
Yeah, especially when nature in many aspects of it, it operates on an exponential basis.

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:43.920
I think this is a very good opportunity also for people to realize that even though we

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:51.040
connect to our reality in a linear way, as you said, we can only think about one thinking

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:53.280
at the same time, nature doesn't work like that.

01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:55.480
It's quantum and it's exponential.

01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:59.520
So it goes, it doesn't go one, two, three, four, five, it goes one, two, four, eight.

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:04.760
And by the time you get to the 30th step, you're already at a billion.

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:05.760
Yep.

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:10.480
And, and that's the thing too, it's, you know, when you take a look at our evolution,

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:16.440
we were in tribes of maybe a hundred, 150 and so the, the thinking mind is extremely

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:21.680
limited when it comes to how many, how many numbers we can come up with, you know, and

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:25.320
then all of a sudden we're thrown into this world where people are talking about millions

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:30.880
and there's billions and all these statistics, which are, you know, just very difficult for

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:33.080
the thinking mind to deal with.

01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:42.060
And it gets very, I think thinking mind is, is, is, is just frustrated because, you know,

01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:46.720
the vast majority of our existence was dealing with groups of a hundred.

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:50.800
You know, this is why, I forget what the number is, but it's this idea that, you know, it

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:55.200
can only really know a hundred people, you know, that's anything beyond that, our mind

01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:57.000
just can't deal with.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.200
And so we may have a thousand social media friends, but the truth is you can't know all

01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:09.560
of them and, and, and, but now the way information is, uh, communicated on the planet, I mean,

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:12.720
we've, we've, we're, we're not dealing with a hundred people.

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:16.520
Suddenly we're a global entity and, and, and it's like, it's like, here we are, you know,

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:19.720
we're pretty good at juggling three balls and we're okay with that and it, but nature

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:23.000
has like an infinite number of balls and we're trying to, and it just, the whole thing just

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.420
fell apart.

01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:28.440
We couldn't, we couldn't even comprehend how we could possibly do it.

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:32.560
And people keep throwing the numbers at us, but the mind can't deal with numbers over

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:34.560
about 150.

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:42.480
Yeah, this difference is very important and, um, I've talked about this a lot, how the

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:47.400
sense of certainty that our parents have had, had nothing to do with reality.

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:51.280
It just had everything to do with limited channels of interpretation and distribution

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:57.120
of information that you would watch, maybe CNN, PBS and Fox.

01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:03.720
When I was growing up in Iran, we had three national channels eventually, and it was like,

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:05.000
this is all you need to know.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:10.320
So eventually people started putting satellite dishes on their rooftops and the government

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:14.920
was coming down hard on people because it's all about that.

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:21.380
You have more information, your mind realizes that, oh, I have more options to choose from.

01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:25.160
But the thing is, why are you making those choices to begin with?

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:27.360
That's the part that nobody's talked about.

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:28.360
Yeah.

01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:33.760
And, and, and, and, you know, um, it can be an oval, even something as simple.

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:35.320
People have talked about this with consumerism.

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:38.800
I mean, it used to be like, look, you know, you had two different types of cereals you

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:43.120
could pick from in the morning and now you've got like, you know, a whole row full filled

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:46.480
with different types of, and you don't even know you, we can't even pick out what kind

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:48.840
of cereal we're going to have in the morning.

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:52.200
And so how are we going to pick out what kind of, and then you have to, you know, it's again

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:53.200
that seriousness.

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:56.440
It's like, look, you, you got to take your news channel seriously.

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:59.400
I mean, but how can you possibly pick the news channel?

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.560
How do I know which source to really go with?

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:04.200
I mean, there are so many to choose from.

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:07.120
Um, I, I, it's, it's just overwhelming.

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:12.880
I mean, we're, because we've, we've in one generation went from, like you said, something

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:18.280
manageable, three stations, maybe two, an infinite number of stations that you can tune

01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:24.440
into on any social media platform and we're connected not just with, you know, a small

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:27.920
group of people, but we're literally connected with the world.

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:33.400
And that's going to get these wonderful conspiracy theories going, but then we don't know what

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:40.600
to make of them because, you know, who knows, how do you make this assertion as to validity?

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:46.000
You know, there's no supreme, you know, who guards the guards, you know, it's, it's free

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.640
for all with, you know, everyone has access, like look, we're talking, we can talk about

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:53.080
whatever we want, you know, and then someone could watch this and, and there, and it's

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:55.640
kind of, again, I think we could look at it in a positive way.

01:13:55.640 --> 01:14:00.520
It's, it's like an interesting time when we, when we can, you know, dig a little deeper

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:06.920
and figure out what we believe, you know, and so we can watch things and, and, and so

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:10.880
you stumble on some YouTube channel and maybe you've never seen the person before, but that's

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:13.480
okay because I don't care about their reputation.

01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:20.280
I'm just gonna ask them whether I think they've got an interesting thing to say, you know?

01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:22.240
So maybe it could turn out to be kind of interesting.

01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:23.240
I don't know.

01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:27.840
Yeah, I think that was exactly why YouTube became as big as they became, but exactly

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:34.160
because of this loss of monopoly of quote unquote, authoritative sources that they're

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:39.600
shutting down people who will come up with any kind of an argument, any kind of a narrative

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:41.960
that goes against the status quo.

01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:47.720
So they're trying to control, again, something that is inherently uncontrollable.

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:55.120
And again, it, it could be really good, it could be really bad, and I think all of this

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:59.960
would make sense once you have some kind of an objective or a goal to assess these steps

01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:04.880
and events on that basis, but there is no such a thing as a collective objective or

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:05.880
a goal.

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:06.880
So, you know?

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:16.080
Just have to wing it, you know, again, yeah, I don't think that's gonna happen.

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:22.000
I think it's an unprecedented moment in the sense that we're bombarded with lots of new

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:28.520
information and you can feel that kind of, like I know my daughter was, sometimes she

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:32.440
doesn't even want to touch a computer because it's too overwhelming.

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:37.200
And so, you know, some people are just gonna kind of shut down with it because the human

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:45.160
mind just, you know, it's just a little too overwhelming for it.

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:50.960
And you know, it's not a great positive message to say, look, we're just gonna have to kind

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:56.320
of sit through the movie and wait to see something.

01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:59.800
But there's some way to some truth to that, you know, no one knows what's gonna happen

01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:01.040
and that could be a positive thing.

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.680
We're just gonna have to wait it out.

01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:07.080
I mean, it's, you know, it's a yin and yang to everything and even though we're bombarded

01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:12.200
with an infinite number of new sources right now, in a way that is like YouTube is really,

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.080
it's a fascinating thing too in some ways.

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:19.800
I've stumbled on people's that I could, I would have never, you know, interacted with

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:23.160
on any level a couple of generations ago.

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:28.400
And I mean, even us talking, you know, a couple of generations ago, we would have never connected

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:33.480
and had conversation and yet here we are, you know, so.

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:34.480
Absolutely.

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:35.480
Yeah.

01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:36.480
I think it's important to understand.

01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:39.200
I'm just quoting what you have behind you.

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:44.200
I believe it's from your book, No Self, No Problem, that you do not exist to serve the

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:47.640
illusion, the illusion exists to serve you.

01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:50.400
And that's, that really is the key of it all.

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:56.160
Let me also show your book to our viewers, No Self, No Problem, how a neuropsychology

01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:59.360
is catching up to Buddhism.

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:03.360
Very few people are having these conversations.

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:06.880
Kapil Gupta, I don't know if you know him.

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:12.280
I send you a link, he had a, he had an interview with Naval Ravikant.

01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:16.600
They're talking about the same thing and the truth basically, that the truth is not good

01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:19.440
or bad, is not one way or another.

01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:24.720
It's basically my interpretation of what is being discussed here and with those people

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:31.240
and few others that I've come across is that instead of looking outward for more and more

01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:38.000
and more, you have to look inward for less and less and less until you get to nothingness.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:42.720
Because nothingness is a very interesting concept to ponder about, that everything has

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:48.780
been created and built so impermanently on some kind of a structure and that structure

01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:50.200
is nothingness.

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:55.040
But that goes against all of our teachings in society and culture and school that, hey,

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:56.720
you just do this, so you gain this.

01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:03.440
You do this, it's a gamified kind of a society that makes us lose the point altogether.

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:10.240
We've been taught, you know, be someone, you know, be someone, do something and to craft

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:15.320
this art of carving away all this superfluous stuff and finding out who you are.

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:22.200
And like you said though, you know, it's a very interesting trip to explore nothingness.

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:27.200
And there's a very interesting link between nothingness and consciousness and it's very

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:30.280
difficult to put into words.

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:34.040
Words don't belong to that realm, that's another thing.

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:35.040
It doesn't.

01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:43.920
And it shows you what an infinitely small slice of existence words are capable of describing.

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:48.960
And we put so much emphasis on words here in the West, but they're extremely limited.

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:49.960
And that's the thing.

01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:55.640
So the self becomes this kind of almost a linguistic, it's so tied in with words and

01:18:55.640 --> 01:19:01.720
it shows you that same kind of like, you know, if people just explore this a day, okay, well,

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:02.720
what is your problems?

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:03.720
What's really going on?

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:07.320
And then you discover, well, they're my problems.

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:13.440
And the wonderful thing about this experience of no self is as soon as you do away with

01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:18.960
the self as a linguistic tool, that that's all it is, it's this thing we've come up

01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:26.360
with that helps us interact with people and it's a convenience and it's a thought of

01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:28.080
who we think we are.

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:31.760
And the moment you can come up with that and experience it and embrace it, even a little

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:37.200
bit, you realize that the moment I realized that there is no self to begin with, every

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:43.360
problem that you had goes along with that self, it goes away with it.

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:48.000
And that's a very nice, light place to be.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:56.320
And I'm convinced that if we can ever connect with our intuition, which is to say, how do

01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:58.960
we solve a problem without thinking about it?

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:06.840
It is to go deep into the nothingness, deep, lose our self in that and see what happens,

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:12.460
see what comes out of it, you know, see what comes out of the nothing and maybe a wonderful

01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:17.280
creative solution, that's where creativity always comes out of the nothingness.

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:22.480
And that's the thing we think, you know, nothingness, what could come out of it?

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:28.520
Again, it's not a logical argument, but something does come out of nothing.

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:33.720
And sometimes some really good things come out of nothing, some creative things that,

01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:38.200
you know, I mean, I'm convinced that all good, interesting, creative ideas come out

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:40.200
of the nothingness.

01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:45.720
And if we can collectively kind of indulge, who knows, maybe we'll find a very interesting

01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:49.400
way out of this, or maybe we won't want to find an interesting way out of it.

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:50.400
Who knows?

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:51.400
Yeah.

01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:53.400
Well, that's the beauty of it too.

01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:54.400
Who knows?

01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:55.400
We'll see.

01:20:55.400 --> 01:21:06.160
Is Terrence McKenna's stone ape theory being discussed in academia at all, the theory that

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:13.680
human brain evolved much faster than the rest of our body because our ape cousins and our

01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:19.360
ancestors started munching on some psychedelic substances?

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:24.600
Only from my students.

01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:29.760
My students would talk about Terrence, but I have yet to have a discussion with another

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:34.280
academic that would venture off into such ideas.

01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:40.400
And you know, it's a very interesting idea that, you know, in terms of evolution, that

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:47.000
certain psychedelics could have given us the kind of leadership, you know, with kindness

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:51.680
that is, that might be really a great way to lead.

01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:55.440
I mean, I could have been a really important way to kind of, you know, organize in a good

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:56.440
way.

01:21:56.440 --> 01:22:03.040
And so, yeah, I mean, it's coming, it's there, but it's mostly a student driven thing.

01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:09.560
You don't find too many of the actual academics talking about mushrooms and, you know, I think

01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:15.000
the whole psychedelic thing is letting go of the – if you're going to have a psychedelic

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:20.360
adventure, don't bring your expectations along for the ride.

01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:26.520
And don't bring, oh, well, it better be like this or this is – I mean, I think the point

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:32.960
is it's going to be an adventure and it's going to take you to a place that, you know,

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:38.080
you probably didn't think it was going to take you.

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:42.880
And so, it's not much of a surprise that academics who emphasize the thinking mind

01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:48.560
to such a high degree, you know, they – I could see why they have downplayed, you know,

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:51.360
the psychedelics and why they've done – I mean, that's a generalization.

01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:56.480
There certainly are some psychologists actually right now who are emphasizing the mushroom.

01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:01.480
In fact, you know, in a way, although it's long overdue, the research of mushrooms and

01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:07.960
psychedelics in terms of treating depression and the cancer and people facing death, you

01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:12.400
know, now that research is being taken kind of seriously, which is interesting, you know.

01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:18.360
Yeah, this comeback of psychedelic revolution in juxtaposition to everything that is happening

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:26.200
is really interesting because you're absolutely right that your expectations do not belong

01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:27.280
to that realm.

01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:33.840
You can take them with you, but that's why people have so-called bad trips because bad

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:36.280
trip is not something that it just makes up for it.

01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:38.040
It's just something that you don't want to deal with.

01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:39.400
You put it in the back of your head.

01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:42.400
It just brings it right in front of you, like you have to deal with it, dude.

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:43.400
You have to deal with it.

01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:51.080
And when you do stronger things like DMT, we talked about DMT last time, then it doesn't

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:53.340
even matter what your intention is.

01:23:53.340 --> 01:24:00.720
You will be taken to a place where to me is the purest experience of nothingness that

01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:05.080
you can have, which is the reason I always find it ridiculous when people are like, well,

01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:06.280
what did you see?

01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:07.280
How did it feel?

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:09.040
Why should I bring it to words?

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:10.040
Yeah.

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:14.920
You know, obviously they want to have some kind of an idea and certainty without trying

01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:15.920
it.

01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:20.240
And I'm just not serving that purpose because it will defeat the whole point of doing something

01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:24.200
that does not belong to this world, literally.

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:26.080
And I think that's the funniest paradox.

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:31.600
The thinking mind always wants to go into a place that it's impossible.

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:37.880
It wants to go into the realm of the unthinking, you know, the realm of being and nothingness.

01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:39.440
And you can't take the thinking mind there.

01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:41.280
It has no place there.

01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:45.900
And so, you know, someone has a certain trip, oh, explain to me your trip.

01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:47.960
And people, you know, the person will just laugh.

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:51.320
Like, you know, what do you want an answer?

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:55.640
What kind of problem are you trying to solve?

01:24:55.640 --> 01:25:03.600
Does the thinking mind interested in the unknown because of boosting its ego or is it, obviously,

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:07.480
it's not interested to defeat itself?

01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:09.280
Is that right?

01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:16.200
I think the thinking mind is convinced that thinking is so important because it justifies

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:17.200
its own existence.

01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:23.600
In the same way that the self justifies its own existence, you know, it's on a very thin

01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:24.600
thread.

01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:28.200
You know, the thinking mind, one, it's very new.

01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:33.040
I mean, 40,000 years sounds like a long time, but in cosmic terms, it's actually a very

01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:34.040
short time.

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:35.040
A weekend.

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:36.040
Yeah.

01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:44.320
And so, it's been continuously trying to challenge the rest of reality and convincing itself

01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:46.840
that it's really that important.

01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:50.960
And when people trip and they have certain experiences and they realize how trivial and

01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:55.480
important triviality the thinking mind is, I mean, you don't want to just lose it.

01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:58.280
I mean, it's helping us communicate right now.

01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:02.680
And so, it has really wonderful things and it can help in certain ways.

01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:08.360
But to have that as your gravitational center of your universe, that's not going to work

01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.880
too well.

01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:17.880
You know, I think when we'd venture off just for a little bit into the nothingness and

01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:21.560
you come back and you say, yeah, you know, I get this thinking mind thing, but I'm not

01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:24.880
going to try to tell you and explain to you what the trip was like.

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:28.480
I mean, what kind of words would you want me to use?

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:29.480
Yeah.

01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:35.520
It's like reading books about what chocolate would taste like.

01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:37.520
You never got to know.

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:38.520
Nope.

01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:45.760
Writing, writing a bike, swimming, you know, there's this, you know, playing a lot of things

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:47.800
that we do.

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:57.320
You do them, you know, and to talk about them is just it's like analyzing poetry.

01:26:57.320 --> 01:27:00.520
You know, there's people out there, you know, it's like, okay, you know, if you want to

01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:03.640
take that trip and you can do it.

01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:08.840
I've had my share of kind of looking into it a little bit, but, you know, I'm not sure

01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:11.200
I could take such a trip too seriously.

01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:13.080
You know, it's there as it's there.

01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:17.400
It's there for its own existence and that's, you know, and that's the center.

01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:22.440
You know, when you make that kind of the center of your universe, the gravitational center

01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:27.280
of your universe, everything, you know, it's hard to take anything too seriously at that

01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:29.680
point and that's a good way to live.

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:33.760
And I think if we could have a little bit, just a nudge, a little bit more of that in

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:39.080
our culture, particularly at times like this, where you see collectively challenges that

01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:43.360
we're dealing with make the thinking mind completely fall apart.

01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:47.160
And that's because we put the thinking mind as the center of our universe.

01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:51.720
That's a dangerous thing to put at the center of your universe because it's so fragile.

01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:55.160
If you put the nothingness at the center, and that sounds strange if people say, how

01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:57.480
can you have nothingness at the center of your universe?

01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:03.120
You've been drinking, but those, you know, who have been, they kind of know what you're

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:04.120
talking about.

01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:08.680
Oh yeah, yeah, you know, you know, and we can deal with thinking mind, you know, and

01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:14.600
it would be very interesting to see how we would deal with certain problems like the

01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:16.640
one we're dealing with right now.

01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:22.160
If we were coming from a place of centered nothingness, if that was our center and we

01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:27.440
recognize and then, you know, it'd be very interesting to see how it would be dealing

01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:32.640
with the situation from a different perspective.

01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:38.880
I think one of the best guides about how to get to, because as you said, you cannot get

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:40.560
rid of the thinking mind.

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:44.200
Trying to get rid of it is playing right into its hand.

01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:49.560
Again, Kapil Gupta, I think he described it really well that where there was one, now

01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:51.760
there is two.

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:57.720
You become an observer of your thinking mind rather than you split what is happening inside

01:28:57.720 --> 01:28:58.720
your head.

01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:02.520
That quote stuck with me so simple and to the point.

01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:08.840
And also what Alan Watts talked about that you just go somewhere and stay quiet for a

01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:13.900
month and at first it's going to be really difficult, your mind is going crazy.

01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:20.480
By the time that you come down from the mountain, you will join any band of people.

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:25.160
You can cause a lot of problems because you don't have that center anymore to define what

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:26.400
is good and what is bad.

01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:35.160
So there are guides other than just smoking DMT that I am not advocating use of any psychedelics

01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:37.280
because I don't know where people are mentally.

01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:42.280
This is a choice that has to be made on, you have to be very honest with yourself to realize

01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:47.720
where are you, who you are and what you want to get out of it to the best of your ability.

01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:55.360
But there are ways and we have to get away from this whole noise.

01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:58.720
I think about it as shut up the noise so we can hear the music.

01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:03.040
Yeah, that's a great line.

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:11.160
The inner chatter, the monkey mind, it's kind of like you said, it's an attentional

01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:13.120
problem in a sense.

01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:16.700
Are you attending to the voice in your head, are you taking those thoughts seriously or

01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:21.720
can you shift that attention over to something else and nothingness is a wonderful thing

01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:26.720
to focus on.

01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:43.040
Yeah, I sort of lost track there for a second but yeah, I mean sometimes there's just nothing

01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:55.520
to say and you just recognize and you dig it.

01:30:55.520 --> 01:31:01.600
And it would be a very interesting thing to see how many people have either metaphorically

01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:07.000
ventured off into the woods or literally have ventured off in the woods as a result of this

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.960
current situation.

01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:16.720
And when they come back, what are we going to do culturally, what about all the people

01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:22.560
who started meditating and then they come back and again, what if it is a sort of collective

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:31.520
transition into something more interesting, something deeper than the thinking mind and

01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:38.880
we all come back and we're kind of like we come back from this and maybe that's the purpose

01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:44.440
of situations like this, you know, shake the thinking mind up a little bit, maybe we needed

01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:45.440
it.

01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:48.520
Shake the thinking mind up and find if there's anything else there.

01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:51.720
For so many people, that's the only thing that exists but you go into the woods long

01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:57.680
enough and you realize how trivial and small the thinking mind is and you become, as you

01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:03.880
said, the observer, you start watching your thoughts which is a great practice especially

01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:04.880
for beginners.

01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:09.040
You start watching your thoughts and you're like, how did I ever buy into that?

01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:17.400
How did I ever think that was me, you know, and that can be very insightful I think.

01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:22.960
Yeah, another interesting way to think about it, I think, is when you look at the fast

01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:27.600
moving train, it looks like a continuous kind of a thing but once it slows down, you see

01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:35.720
the gap between the wagons and that's exactly how, at least to me, it happened, that your

01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:41.360
thoughts just one after another, you don't even think about that there is a gap.

01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:46.800
So if you slow down and find one gap, I think that pokes a hole into this illusion that

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:51.160
hey, what do you feel and what do you think about, you have to react to it immediately

01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:56.920
whether emotionally or physically or verbally, however it is.

01:32:56.920 --> 01:33:01.680
Well, and you seem like a fellow guitarist, I see some guitars in the background, one

01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:08.720
of my favorite things when I'm playing guitar is you stop thinking and you've really embraced

01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:12.200
like I have no idea what's going to happen, I don't even know how I'm doing this, I don't

01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:18.280
know how I'm doing it and it all happens and the less you think about it and the more you

01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:22.240
get in touch with the spontaneity and the better it ends up being and then the thinking

01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:27.680
mind comes back on and says, oh, wait a minute, that was really good and then it screws everything

01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:28.680
up.

01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:34.040
But there you can notice the same gaps and sometimes it could be a little bit more intentional

01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:37.560
because when you're playing an instrument, you're sitting down and sometimes it takes

01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:41.840
a while to get that gap and then all of a sudden the gap can get to be pretty – there

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:46.760
are sometimes I've sat down and I didn't even notice a half an hour went by and I was

01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:50.880
just so blissful, I'm like, wow, half an hour, I haven't had one thinking thought

01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:58.880
the whole time and so music has a certain way and it – again, intellectuals like why

01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:04.440
would – music is such – I did a project for my class, I said what – it was a Friday

01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:09.040
project and all they had to do is say what music means to me and it blew me away.

01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:12.160
I mean sometimes students will write down a couple of sentences, they're trying to

01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:17.640
get by and like, okay, I'll do this assignment but – and man, that was the best – one

01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:21.720
of the best overall assignments I've ever given students. When I said what does music

01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:27.280
mean to me, I just – people went on pages and pages and describing how – and it's

01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:31.160
like from an intellectual perspective, that's very interesting because music doesn't do

01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:37.080
anything, you know. I mean these aren't professional musicians that are making money, you know.

01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:40.880
So if it doesn't make money, it doesn't make us a better – why are you doing it?

01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:45.120
Well, the wonderful thing about music is it gives us – it gives us – it's a purposeful

01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:52.560
gap in the thinking mind. And it's – and so you start – realize – I mean one possibility

01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:57.240
in – I'm kind of exploring this in the book I'm working on is that we don't think

01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:02.840
as much as we think we think, which puts another kind of thing into the thinking. Like when

01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:05.840
you're in the – it's like the refrigerator problem, you know. You open the door and it

01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:09.360
seems like the light's always on.

01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:12.960
And so like – and so we think we have a thinking problem because, you know, like right

01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:16.240
now, if you start putting the thinking mind on the table, it feels like I'm thinking

01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:21.080
all the time. And really, we're not. And in fact, those gaps you're talking about

01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:26.760
happen a lot. We just don't notice the gaps. We're so identified with the parts of the

01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:32.120
train, you know, we're not even noticing the gaps. They're there and we can work on

01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:37.720
noticing them. And the more we notice them, the more we realize how small the train is

01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:43.340
and how everything – so much of it is gaps. And I think that's one of the fundamental

01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:48.520
reasons why music is so important to people. It's that vacation from the thinking mind

01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:56.040
that so many people need. And so I tell a lot of people, you know, get an instrument,

01:35:56.040 --> 01:36:00.720
you know. If you're sitting around and you're plagued by your thoughts and you can't seem

01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:04.680
to find a way out of the thinking mind because the more you try to get out of it, the more

01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:12.360
deep you get into it, pick up an instrument and start messing around. That's a great

01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:15.960
way to get those gaps to become more obvious.

01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:21.720
Yeah. Well, music for me, you know, I always think of it looking back, especially I'm

01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:26.640
writing my memoir now and I have to relive a whole bunch of stuff that was not comfortable

01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:30.700
living in the first time around. But it's really interesting going through them now

01:36:30.700 --> 01:36:37.320
with this perspective. Interesting that those things happen. I couldn't have planned any

01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:42.760
of them. Same thing with music. Like music found me. I didn't find music. It was inevitable.

01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:50.800
And the point I think is – well, music is one medium, but it's all about the artwork

01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:58.480
and creative process that is built upon, again, nothingness. That you become this conduit

01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:07.760
rather than a critical thinker through whom ideas flow. Alex Gray talked about that as

01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:12.800
being visionary artists, that you experience the light of the divine, you become a conduit

01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:20.080
through whom this light is projected and reflected through your work. And when done correctly

01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:27.120
in that context, your audience will have the similar kind of an experience. And, you know,

01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:34.360
I read his book like a year and a half ago, The Mission of Art, a few days after I did

01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:41.240
my first ayahuasca ceremony. And it was just mind-blowing. I fell in love with music all

01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:48.280
over again because of like this is the objective. This is the purpose. Not objective, but the

01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:55.280
purpose. And I had those experiences that, you know, I'm gone. I am not here. I don't

01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:58.960
know what's going on. I don't know where these things are coming from. And the moment

01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:04.280
I try to make sense out of them, they're gone. Which suggests to me, nobody who's done anything

01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:08.940
of similar kind of substance that resonates with people, they wouldn't know how they

01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:13.800
did it and they wouldn't be able to replicate it themselves.

01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:18.120
And that's – and when you start with music, then you start realizing how true that is

01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:22.720
for so much of what we do. So when I read the book, I'm like, I have no idea where

01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:27.840
that stuff came from. You know, it's like it just falls out of nothingness. You know,

01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:30.840
I don't really – and then you can kind of tell, like there's stuff that my ego

01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:34.200
sort of creates and that's always crap. And I'm like, okay, just throw that all

01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:35.200
out.

01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:36.200
Yeah.

01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:38.960
And there's the other good stuff that comes from nothing. And you're like, you keep

01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:43.160
that stuff because that's the stuff that people connect with. You know, you can tell

01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:47.300
whether I'm faking it. And if I'm purposely trying to be clever and you're reading a

01:38:47.300 --> 01:38:50.880
book and you're, oh, you know, you can tell when that person was trying to be clever versus

01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:57.320
when it came from a really interesting place. And so it's, you know, probably around

01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:01.580
any source. I mean, maybe even like accounting. Maybe, you know, there's certain clever

01:39:01.580 --> 01:39:06.920
things that happen in accounting that come from the nothingness. I don't know. But

01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:13.160
I think music is probably a good place to start and then kind of expand that experience

01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:15.080
into the other parts of your life.

01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:19.720
Absolutely. Hey, we mentioned number of names. I think it's also valuable to mention the

01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:23.600
name Ikkyo. Are you familiar with Ikkyo?

01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:30.240
Um, nothing's, I mean, come to mind.

01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:35.920
So Ikkyo, it's actually really interesting in my life because I grew up watching Ikkyo's

01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:44.240
son, which is an animation about this child Zen monk who's very witty and very intelligent,

01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:48.880
always play tricks on emperors and all that. And this is on Iranian television, dubbed

01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:58.440
in Farsi. Fast forward to 2011, I came across a traveling Zen monk at a very specific point

01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:03.320
of my life who was practicing Zen alongside with psychedelics. And he was, he got kicked

01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:07.020
out of the monastery when he was a teenager, exactly because of that, because he had an

01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:12.400
experiment with a psychedelic mushroom and he went and told his Roshi about it. I was

01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:17.760
like, what, what are you talking about? You don't belong here. And I was like, Oh, I had

01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:22.840
a, you know, we had a children program named Ikkyo's son. His name was Ikkyo also, the

01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:28.400
Zen master that I came across. And he said that he was named after Ikkyo, who is a Zen

01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:35.600
figure and a folk hero of Japan. And this is a man who went again, he was a bastard

01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:44.160
of some really wealthy or well-connected individual in Japan. So he was given to a Zen monastery

01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:50.640
and he grew up in there and they gave him eventually certification of enlightenment.

01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:56.000
And upon reception, he tore it apart. Like this is nonsense. And he left, he left the

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:03.680
monastery and he became the person who was a poet and he would drink and go to brothels.

01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:11.040
And a lot of his poetry is about prostitutes and how he feels about them. And his whole

01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:16.760
perspective was that sexual desire is a desire that you have trying to defeat it is defeating

01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:23.680
the defeating what is. And again, like exactly what we're talking about. And there are so

01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:30.880
very few of these figures throughout history that to me at least is like what, what really

01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:37.500
is valuable is being found in this realm in a very rare kind of a quantity. So I thought

01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:41.880
it would be interesting to also mention Nikkyo. I'll send you some links to some of his poetry.

01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:43.760
He's a very interesting figure.

01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:48.480
Well, that's it. You know, people who seem to be able to, that's a Zen master trip to

01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:55.320
be, to embrace the natural flow of reality. And we all, you know, are just so amazed when

01:41:55.320 --> 01:42:00.320
we see someone who just, you can't like get them to be nervous. You can't get them to

01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:06.600
be embarrassed. You can't get that. You can't like get them to regret anything that happens.

01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:10.160
And that gets very frustrating for, you know, normal people because they kind of like, you

01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:17.760
know, this is a perfect flow. And yeah. And then, you know, that there's an old Zen saying

01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:20.720
about the snake, you know, some snake bit someone and they're like, well, aren't you

01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:24.660
mad? He's like, no, it's the nature of the snake to bite. Why would I be mad at them?

01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:29.680
And it's the nature of us to have sexual impulses, to have aggressive impulses. And we get hung

01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:37.240
up on this. And we're like, oh, well, you know, I was really angry the other day. So,

01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:41.360
you know, oh, well, that means that I'm not very spiritually developed. Really? I didn't

01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:49.400
know that. You know, it's just that, I mean, Zen masters get frustrated like anyone else.

01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:54.000
The only thing is they don't get hung up on being frustrated, you know, and they have

01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:00.080
sexual, you know, the whole flow of that kind of nature. Are we trying to control it or

01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:04.280
do you just let it happen? And it sounds like, you know, like so many Zen masters, they were

01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:10.280
just really good at just letting it happen. And there's just not that many places in our

01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:15.240
culture for people who see, although even though there's not many places, they're still

01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:19.520
such a mystery to us, you know, and we know there's something very unique and special

01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:24.920
about them, you know, and they can just like, you know, I think comedians are kind of away

01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:30.480
in this sense, you know, especially the comedian who would do like live, like this live stuff,

01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:33.920
and they just flow and they come up with something and it looks like someone in the audience

01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:38.680
is slamming and they just turn it around perfectly. And we're all just kind of, wow, you know,

01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:42.820
how'd you do that without thinking about it? It just, you know, it was that perfect kind

01:43:42.820 --> 01:43:48.800
of flow of, you know, whatever happens, whatever the world, I'm just going to go with it. And

01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:55.800
then it gets very harmonious and poetry-like. And that seems to be the trip of the Zen master.

01:43:55.800 --> 01:44:00.600
Of course, the problem is, you know, we're not going to be able to think our way into

01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:06.240
it and what they've learned and discovered, you know, is that kind of, I mean, so much

01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:13.160
of the Zen literature is anti-intellectual, you know. And so, actually, Alan Watts told

01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:19.160
a really interesting story of, you know, going into Koan and he thought he'd be very clever

01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:23.400
and he kind of took a frog and put it under his kimono. And so, when he asked like, well,

01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:26.560
what's your true nature? And he's going to pull the frog out. And the teacher just looked

01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:33.120
at him and says, too intellectual, you know. He thought about it too much. And you can't

01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:39.720
plan to be spontaneous, you know. And that's the problem, you know. The Zen, they become

01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:45.860
one with nature. And because of that, they're genuinely spontaneous. The rest of us are

01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:51.280
too busy planning on what we're going to do to even enjoy what's happening. And we're

01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:54.760
too busy being clever or trying to be clever or come up with that next, you know, it's

01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:59.760
like in a conversation, you're not really listening to the person. You're really thinking

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:05.960
of your next clever statement, you know. And so, you miss out on what's happening and missing

01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:09.640
out on what's happening. You're missing out on reality. So, how can you flow with it if

01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:16.840
you're not even attending to it? And so, yeah. I'd be interested in getting in some of that

01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:17.840
poetry.

01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:23.360
Yeah, for sure. I love it. I start reading them and then poetry started coming to me.

01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:28.240
Like, you know, again, I don't think about them. They come to me. Some of them are shorter.

01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:32.440
Some of them are longer. And I write them down maybe within a minute or two. And that's

01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:38.080
it. I move on to something else. But he definitely has been in such an interesting way from that

01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:43.920
children program to the Zen master I met. Very interesting figure. And I think it's

01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:48.640
also interesting to mention that just because somebody started doing Zen, that doesn't mean

01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:55.320
that they become, you know, so-called enlightened. Because there are a lot of them who get very

01:45:55.320 --> 01:46:00.720
occupied with the institution and how they look and the respect they should get and all

01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:08.760
that. Again, Ikkyu left the apparatus of Zen establishment back then in Japan for the exact

01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:11.480
same thing. None of this matters.

01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:19.520
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's the whole nature of things becoming formal and creating a bureaucracy.

01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:26.200
You know, there's nothing bureaucratic about Zen, but for some reason, people can't help

01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:30.280
making it into a bureaucracy. You know, what are the ten principles of Zen? I mean, how

01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:34.160
could you not laugh at such a thing? It's like, look, are you really going to try to

01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:42.120
force it into ten principles? And I remember another story. I think it was Suzuki who was

01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:47.040
giving a speech at Berkeley and he was trying to give like five concepts or maybe it was

01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:52.040
the Eightfold Path, some very basic Buddhist principle. And he's like, I can't remember

01:46:52.040 --> 01:47:03.040
any of this. He goes, just look it up. Yeah. So, you know, but that's, you know, he went

01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:07.160
with it. You know, he couldn't remember it and instead of fighting it and being frustrated

01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:11.800
and tensing up and you know, he just, you know, hey, I forgot it. I don't know. You

01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:14.160
know, and yeah.

01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:22.920
That's awesome. I love it. I hope I'll have you back. My goal is to have 100 episodes

01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:28.320
of this podcast by the end of the year. I hope I can get you back maybe in a couple

01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:34.480
of months to review the world. Who knows what's going to happen? I love these kind of conversations.

01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:40.880
Yeah, it's really enjoyable. And like you said, I mean, right now, we don't know. And

01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:44.440
so we have to wait till the end of the movie and it would be fun to get back together and

01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:50.760
kind of say, hey, wow, we didn't see that happening. No one could have predicted that

01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:54.400
one. Yeah. And yeah, that'd be fun.

01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:59.880
Awesome. Chris, where can our audience follow your work?

01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:03.440
Most of the stuff I've been doing, probably on my YouTube channel, there's Chris Neibar

01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:14.720
PhD. And I make video a couple of times a week and just explore different things. And

01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:20.160
I have a Facebook, there's no self. I think if you look up Facebook, no self, no problem.

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:26.200
It should come up. And I usually do post and just about the same stuff we were talking

01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:31.200
about different kinds of self consciousness and all these kinds of things. But probably

01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:35.640
Facebook and YouTube are probably my main things and Twitter a little bit, but not as

01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:45.920
much. And yeah, and, you know, I'm hoping to get something out. My next book is going

01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:49.800
to be something about not thinking about consciousness. And hopefully that'll be out probably next

01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:54.960
summer probably. But that's something I've been busy with this summer and probably fall.

01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:59.800
We'll see where that goes. But I'll keep you up to date. Yeah, we come out soon.

01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:04.600
Yeah, awesome. Let me ask you the last question I ask all my guests, which the question itself

01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:08.960
has become meaningless for me throughout this process. When I came up with it, I was so

01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:15.440
happy like this. This is a fucking great question. But right now I'm like, why am I even asking

01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:19.680
this? But I'll continue asking it that if you come across an intelligent alien from

01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:24.040
a different civilization, what would you say the worst thing humanity has done? And what

01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:32.720
would you say is our greatest achievement? I think if I ran into an alien, and I had

01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:39.440
to explain humanity, I would say please forgive us for our thinking mind. We didn't mean it.

01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:45.080
The thinking mind had the best intentions. And it's true, it paved the road to hell,

01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:50.120
but it was really just doing it had the best intentions. So forgive us for the thinking

01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:58.680
mind and all the messes that we got into thinking our way out of the messes. I think the best

01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:08.040
thing humanity has got going for us is that ordinary people have experiences beyond the

01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:13.840
ordinary. You know, you can have the conversations and sometimes you can find people like, you

01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:17.680
know, you would never expect they seem so by the book, and they seem like they followed

01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:21.000
all the rules, but to get them in the right context, and they'll still tell you about

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:27.480
some bizarre experience they've had that went beyond the normal. And they know this thing

01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:32.400
we're talking about. They know the nothingness. They know the void. They know the connection

01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:37.080
between nothingness and somethingness. And they sort of get it. And I think I would convince

01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:44.500
the alien, look, you know, we've got hope. We may be possessed by the thinking mind,

01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:49.240
but we've also seen beyond it enough of us have. And we know that beyond the thinking

01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:53.880
mind, there's a certain connection that we all have. And so if we can just make it through

01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:57.440
without, you know, blowing the planet up, if we could just make it long enough without

01:50:57.440 --> 01:51:03.000
destroying ourselves, we're going to come up with something really pretty cool. That

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:31.000
would be my plea to the alien.
