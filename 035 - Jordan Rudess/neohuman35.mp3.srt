1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
What I really am most interested in though is how you take technology and how you apply it to

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,360
who we are as human beings. How do you take what we can do physically and emotionally and transfer

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,880
that into the possibility of making expressive music.

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:30,320
Hello and welcome to the 35th episode of Neo Human Podcast. I'm a Ghabhari agologist on Twitter and

6
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,200
With me today, I have the pleasure of having Jordan Rudis. Welcome to Neo Human Podcast, Jordan.

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,440
Thank you. You've been involved in music in one way or another since the 60s. How music has evolved

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,320
since then and would it be fair to say that technology has had a direct role in the evolution

9
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:05,040
of the music itself? Absolutely. I mean, I grew up personally as a trained concert pianist. I was

10
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:12,160
being groomed to be a concert pianist and, you know, when I was 17 or 18, I started to discover

11
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,280
all about synthesizers and I just watched so many changes. But I would say the main change with

12
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,400
technology and the way that the music has changed is that there was this old argument in the early

13
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,640
days of synthesis where people were saying that there's just not the ability to be expressive or

14
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,960
shall we say organic with sound. And now I think that it's impossible, unless you're completely

15
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,880
blind and live in the dark, it's impossible to make that argument because the capabilities of

16
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:50,080
making music using technology have brought it to a point where the instruments are so sensitive,

17
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:58,480
so organic. An example being, you know, like the instrument called the seaboard that I worked on

18
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:04,960
the last few years. It's a very expressive new kind of instrument. So yeah, so I think that that

19
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,840
has brought a lot of changes about and also, you know, the ability to just, you know, continue this

20
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,320
kind of sonic exploration, which is possible through the advancement of synthesis itself,

21
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:20,240
being able to not only make different kinds of sounds, but also to be able to play with sounds

22
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:28,000
in the spatial domain have changed things up a lot as well. So would it be fair to say that in music,

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,360
as well as everywhere else in our life that we see today, the line between digital and analog is

24
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,760
becoming more and more blurry? Yeah, I would say that. I'd definitely say that because the fluidity

25
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,960
of control has gotten so great that you kind of you definitely lose that kind of

26
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,560
the feeling that you're, you know, working in steps, and it rather feels more, you know,

27
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,200
closer to like the human spirit and what people think of as analog. Yeah. We talk a lot about

28
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,400
how automation is affecting industries across the board with the assumption that creative fields

29
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,600
are more difficult to automate. However, we have seen that through machine learning, AIs have

30
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,720
composed songs, written novels and screenplays. We've seen the hologram Hatsune Miku becoming

31
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,160
number one pop star in Japan and music composed by Squarepusher performed entirely by the Japanese

32
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,200
robots, Banshee machines. How do you see technology affecting music and musicians themselves going

33
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:32,480
forward? Well, I think I see all different types of technology. You know, it's a world where every

34
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,240
day we wake up and there's something else amazing that we hear about, you know, whether it's a machine

35
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:45,200
playing an instrument or some kind of a piece that was written by a computer and less, you know, and

36
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,160
well, less and less human involvement, or maybe some technologies where there are where there is,

37
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,400
you know, some kind of participation or interaction and some that are not. But I guess

38
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,720
what I care about what I'm I like, you know, I'm into gadgets. I like all technology. I think it's,

39
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,080
you know, it's cool for a robot to play a musical instrument. What I really am most interested in,

40
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,960
though, is how you take technology and how you apply it to who we are as human beings.

41
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,040
How do you take what we can do physically and emotionally and transfer that into the possibility

42
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,120
of making expressive music? So, you know, growing up on the piano, the piano is a very beautiful

43
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:30,000
instrument. But it's, you know, there's a point where you can say, OK, well, you can only do so

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,080
much because once your finger, it's once your finger presses down on a key, the hammer hits

45
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,000
the string and the sound is in the air. And then you're controlling the sound in a way, but you're

46
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,680
not involved with the sound at every moment. An example of an instrument, an older instrument that

47
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,080
that has, you know, a great level of control would be something like a violin or even a wind

48
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,280
instrument where you're, you know, we're in charge of the note at every given second, the dynamics,

49
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,960
the pitch. But the more control you have at every moment, I think the better. And I'm excited about

50
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,080
technology that really allows us to express and gives us more control of making the music. But

51
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:12,240
not only that, but maybe things that give us more information as well. So as you're playing,

52
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,480
you can actually see or feel what's going on to help kind of bring the performance to a higher

53
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,960
level. These are the kind of things that I spend a lot of time thinking about, like when I released

54
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,120
my first application with my wisdom music company and we produced MorphWiz, although now you go back

55
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,120
and it's a pretty simple application. The concept of it was very strong, which was that I wanted to

56
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:45,040
give the user a way to work with sound and morph between waveforms, but not only sonic waveforms,

57
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:52,160
but also visual waveforms and have a large area to express that. So you're hearing the sound,

58
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,240
you're seeing it, you're getting the information, there's even an entertainment aspect to it,

59
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,200
but putting those all together is a good, that kind of thinking, I think is a good step towards

60
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,280
what technology ideally could do for creative people, musicians.

61
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,440
Yeah, absolutely. I was going to ask you about wisdom music. What inspired you to start it when

62
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,240
you did? Because you started it quite early on, I would say maybe, was it 2009?

63
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,440
Yeah, it was about eight years ago. It was when the first iPhones were being put out.

64
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:33,760
What got me into it was that I had tried one of the very, very first iPhones and I thought,

65
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,880
even though I was playing on a very primitive little piano that somebody put on the screen,

66
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:45,200
like a one octave kind of thing, I had this feeling that on a multi-touch surface that more

67
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,000
could be done. And there's actually a pretty funny story, which is that around that time,

68
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,640
my wife and I had just purchased a beautiful nine foot Steinway grand for my, I think that's like

69
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:02,880
for my 50th birthday at that point. And instead of playing the piano a lot, I would sit around and

70
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:10,160
just make this ridiculous sound on my new Apple device. And she looked at me one day and said,

71
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,400
why are you making that horrible sound on that thing? And I was like, no, no, no, I have an idea.

72
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:21,200
I really have an idea here. Leave me alone. I got something in mind. So it was maybe one of the

73
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:27,360
few times that I was right. And I did have some pretty cool idea about a way to think about using

74
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:36,400
a multi-touch surface to make music. And then later on I produced MorphWiz. So my desire was

75
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,440
to really take these multi-touch surfaces and figure out how to make music with them. What

76
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:50,160
the best way to do that would be. And I realized that by being able to have control of a whole

77
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,640
playing surface or whole area like that, that each finger could kind of have an individual

78
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:00,880
identity and have room to express. And so that's kind of one of the driving

79
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,400
courses in what I do with the music. I think cost is also a very important factor

80
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,680
because I remember when I was a kid, we couldn't afford the piano. We ended up with

81
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,800
one of the CT models that was like tenth of a price. So it's becoming more available to more

82
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,400
people. They can make more music. And I think I used to have a VL tone. I think that was an

83
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:29,360
inspiration to me as well. It was a Casio model that did some pretty cool things. But yeah,

84
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,720
I think this generation, it's amazing to think that what they carry around in their pockets,

85
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:42,000
whether it's an iOS device or an Android device or Windows, whatever, you can do things on these

86
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,560
little devices we walk around with. But you just can't do almost every product that you'd find in

87
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,680
a music store. As far as what kind of visuals you might see on your device when you're making

88
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:58,240
the music or some kind of multi-touch expression that you can do by playing a note and moving your

89
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,040
finger on it and changing the sonic parameters while you're holding the note. I mean, it's

90
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,400
incredible. It's almost like we're playing catch up now in the hardware world to bring it up to

91
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:14,560
speed with what people expect from the little apps that they can buy on their iOS device.

92
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,480
And not only that, I think that the young musicians, people who are really interested

93
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,120
in music that want to get into music, I think that instead of maybe going to a guitar center

94
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:32,000
or something like that, they can go to the Apple app store and get a GeoShred or some other app

95
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,600
that lets them into a pretty deep world of music for very few dollars. Yeah, that completely new

96
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,280
approach. They're talking about how malls are going out of business in the US. Do you think

97
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:49,600
the same thing will happen to music stores? I think that we've seen it happening,

98
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,360
unfortunately, because I like music stores and I like record stores. I miss them when they change.

99
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:02,560
But I really do think that there's going to be a big movement, and there already is,

100
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,120
towards people realizing that they can get really great instruments on their iPad.

101
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,360
So what does that mean? I don't know. We have to figure out what that all means and how to make

102
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,880
it work. But that's what I think is happening. You said in 2014 that streaming music services

103
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,320
won't allow creative musicians to survive. Do you still think like that? Would you expand on that?

104
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,520
I think that there's a big problem there. I think that everybody's trying to count on streaming music

105
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:37,920
as a way that musicians will hopefully be able to stay alive. Because there's so many services

106
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,040
now and that's where things are going and people aren't buying CDs anymore. It's almost like a

107
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:50,560
desperation thought that that's what's going to be happening. Personally, I'm putting my time into

108
00:10:52,720 --> 00:11:00,240
other kinds of ideas. I'm about to launch, as an example, a new platform called ArtistCo,

109
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:08,720
A-R-T-I-S-T-C-O, in about two weeks. And it's a system that is based on artists supporting each

110
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:17,760
other. Fans, die-hard fans supporting the artist. It's very much kind of an affiliate type of an

111
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,920
idea. But just to give you an example of the way that it could work is if you're an artist and

112
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,840
you're over in China with a million followers and I'm Jordan Rudis here. Well, right now I'm in

113
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:34,560
Munich, but let's say I'm at home in the US. I would then post a link that says, please check out

114
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:41,520
Zhao Yitong's music in China and everybody who follows that link would go to his ArtistCo site

115
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,960
and when they sign up for it, then I would get a small percentage of the sign up fee. So it's about

116
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:54,240
artists supporting each other and really turning on the fan bases to each other's music and gaining

117
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:01,920
support and financial support from that kind of a mechanism. So that's the kind of thing that I

118
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,480
think has a lot of possibility for the future where the artist goes directly to the fan. It's

119
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,800
very much the kind of independent artist thinking that there's a bunch of artists that are leaning

120
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,280
towards that where you kind of get rid of the middle man and you do it yourself. And that

121
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:22,400
doesn't necessarily, that doesn't really involve the streaming services. It involves more allowing

122
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:35,360
fans to have access to an area where you put your material. Is it only on the distribution side or

123
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,760
do you also, let's say Jordan Rudis has a part and some drummer in Mongolia adds something cool to

124
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,520
it and Jordan Rudis and the Mongolian drummer end up making the music together? This particular

125
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:52,720
service at this point, at least when it's released, will not be, it's not a service that allows like

126
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,760
jamming together. It's not about that. It's more about releasing music, things maybe you've never

127
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,480
heard before or things you have heard before, even if it's educational materials or it could be

128
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,960
videos. So it's more about distributing the art rather than it's about collaborating.

129
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:16,480
Right. Streaming in a way itself seems to have emerged as an alternative to and as a solution

130
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,640
for pirating, but then it created a whole bunch of new challenges on its own. What do you think can

131
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:27,520
be a good replacement for streaming services, if anything, or do we need to shift our attention to

132
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:35,440
a completely different form than streaming? Well, as somebody who loves music, I mean, first of all,

133
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,720
I can really appreciate the idea of streaming. I think it's good. I just think the biggest problem

134
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:47,360
with it is monetization of the artist. There's just no real money to speak of that's going to

135
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:53,840
the artist to keep the artists alive. So that's the reason that I'm investing time and resources

136
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,880
into like ArtistCo, because I think it's a way that artists can actually stay alive. I think

137
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,880
that's crucial. I mean, as a listener, I think, okay, well, Spotify or the Apple Music system,

138
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:11,200
those are really, really great things. The Pandora system, the new premium is great. It's all good

139
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,720
from a listener's point of view, but how much money is the artist going to make? And can they

140
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:24,080
really continue to do their art form with that kind of service? I don't think so. I think it's

141
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:30,240
really got to change. Right. It seems to be the culture of consumers and music listeners also

142
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,280
need to change to realize that it's true that you can't get a piece of music for free, but

143
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:40,560
if you want that artist that you like to continue making music, you need to pay for it. That's

144
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,600
right. Yeah, it's a cultural thing where everybody thinks they can get everything for free. And it's

145
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,880
very difficult. I mean, it's difficult to a point, but then it's even more difficult beyond that.

146
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:59,200
And one example is even on my own, like I love to be in my piano room at home, but it's

147
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,880
piano room at home and say, oh, I feel like improvising. And then I can just turn on my

148
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,880
iPhone and point it to the piano and go hit Facebook live. And the next thing you know,

149
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,880
I'm playing for a few thousand people around the world on a moment's notice. And it's really nice.

150
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,160
But there's the side of that that's not so great, which is that, yes, it's great as a fan. You can

151
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:28,880
tune in, you can listen to me play, but there's no financial interest in that. So I'm just

152
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,960
basically, not only am I giving it away, but I'm saying here, here's some more music for free.

153
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:38,080
Right. And you've always jumped in right into anything new. I remember watching you at Stageit

154
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,320
platform. You've been so innovative. And I think that's one of the problems that a lot of musicians

155
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,440
have that they just ignore all this digital and new advancement. I'm like, well, this is not natural.

156
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,240
This is not real music. Yeah. I think it's really important to pay attention to all those kinds of

157
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,880
developments and be conscious of it because not only do I think it's fun, but I think it's

158
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,120
important to understand where it's going and how each musician can kind of contribute to where it

159
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:07,280
should be going. Right. So do you think that's the constant reformation in music as a result

160
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:14,160
of technology calls for constant reformation in the music industry and the music and musicianship

161
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:21,120
itself? Yeah, I think that, well, you know, a lot of this, a lot of the industry is just kind of

162
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,280
blinded at this point by a incredible desire to, to, to maintain, you know, what they have or

163
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:33,360
necessity. The business. Yeah. They just need to do whatever they can to stay employed and keep it

164
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,400
alive. And, and as far as the musicians go, a lot of, you know, most musicians out there don't even

165
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:44,000
don't understand what's, uh, you know, what the new world is all about. They live in a space where

166
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,560
they're kind of thinking that, you know, it should be like what used to be happening. One of the

167
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,680
challenges is that, um, you know, many of the musician friends that I have that I grew up with

168
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:01,760
don't get this kind of, um, idea that the musician is going to be so close with the fans and like

169
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,960
where the fan can actually have access to them. They feel like this got to be the separation.

170
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:12,880
And so it creates a real roadblock to kind of, uh, allowing the new technologies to work for them.

171
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,640
That's a very good point. And to even, and to even be part of figuring out how and where we should be

172
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,960
moving to, because, you know, as soon as a fan gets close, they go, Oh, this doesn't, this is not

173
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,040
right. They're supposed to be at a distance and I'm supposed to be up here on a, you know, on a

174
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:31,920
throne or something like that. And that's what creates the celebrity magic. Well, I mean, things,

175
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,600
you know, move very fast and unfortunately that's not the way that business works, that the music

176
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,440
business works and that's not what the fans want. And, uh, we have to, we have to start, you know,

177
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,840
as a culture, kind of embracing this new way of thinking. Some of us are more comfortable with

178
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,960
that and some of us are just not, you know, but I think that, uh, you know, I watch musician friends

179
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,960
every day kind of go, Oh, wow. Oh, I see. Yeah. Okay. And step by step, they're being kind of

180
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,600
almost led into this new direction. And, you know, and those who are smart, they're open,

181
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,240
we'll get it. And others will just close down and, you know, and they'll be kind of left behind.

182
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,680
Yeah. That's a very good point. Let's talk a little bit, uh, a little bit about music. What

183
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:17,360
is improvisation? Because I know you, um, you think of improvising, the ability to improvise

184
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,760
is a very important factor, uh, to have as a musician. What is improvisation? Who is an

185
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:28,080
improviser and how can an improviser improve his improvisational skill? Uh, it's a really good

186
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,200
question. Um, improvisation, first of all, is something that is very, very important to me.

187
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,120
It's something that I've always done even through all my years. Uh, at Julliard, I would be, I guess,

188
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,720
a closet improviser, if you will, because it wasn't so much allowed in those, uh, in the

189
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:52,560
Julliard, you know, halls. Um, but to me, the art of improvisation is, it's, it's like speaking a

190
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:58,880
language. It's, it's very much speaking the language of music. Um, and what it means to me

191
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,680
is that like, just personally, I could sit down with the piano and just start playing stuff that

192
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,840
you've never heard before and do it, you know, for as long as I was sitting down with the piano,

193
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,440
whether it's good or not, or whether it flows smoothly or not, there's different factors that

194
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:18,160
that depends on things like, am I feeling relaxed? Am I, do I have other things on my mind? Um, you

195
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:24,560
know, all kinds of things can get in the way, mental clutter, but generally it's, I very much

196
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:30,240
think of it as a lot like speaking a language. Um, an example being, if I was feeling, uh,

197
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,360
especially emotional about something, that's a great time for me to sit at the piano and express

198
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:41,760
that with music. And what makes that possible to even improvise, to make up stuff on the spot,

199
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,400
is to have tools to do that. Like when you learn a language, you learn words, you learn to connect

200
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,400
words and make sentences to express in their phrases. Well, in music, you need, you need to

201
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,360
connect notes together. You need to connect harmony together. You need to know that, you know,

202
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,600
these certain kinds of chords, if you put them together, they will express a certain feeling

203
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:08,560
or create a certain kind of vibe. If you're not familiar with any of those harmonic melodic tools,

204
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,520
any of the rhythmic tools, then you're not going to be able to speak the language.

205
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,560
First of all, if you don't like, uh, if you don't know any kind of theory and, or if you don't have

206
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:24,080
a good ear for music, you can't hear what a harmonic change is going to sound like in your head

207
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:31,120
before you hit the note. Your chance of speaking the language, uh, is very limited. However,

208
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,520
if you have some skill, some theoretical skill, and maybe even above that, if you have a good

209
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,600
ear for music, meaning you can hear the notes in your head before your hand touches the instrument,

210
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,920
then you can understand how to communicate that way because you can start putting things together.

211
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,080
So it's very much about developing tools, maybe, you know, even if it's practicing scales or

212
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,440
arpeggios or chord patterns in different keys so that when you do sit down, you can express and

213
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,960
you can play in a style. You know, if somebody, one of the challenges, one of the things I like

214
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,360
to try to do, and sometimes I'm more successful than other times, but one of the things if somebody

215
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,280
says, well, Jordan, play something that's like a Chopin nocturne. And I sit down and I play and I,

216
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,080
you know, I can go and I can speak, you know, I can, I can go into that and start speaking

217
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,600
language. Or somebody says, play something jazzy or, you know, new agey or Genesis-like. I know,

218
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,640
you know, I spent time with the chords. I developed them. I understand many of the changes and

219
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,800
I can go into that mode. So I hope that answers a bit of that question.

220
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,200
Yeah, absolutely. Jordan, I know your time is limited. I hope we get a chance to have a more

221
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,880
in-depth conversation in the future. But let me ask you the last question I ask all my guests,

222
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,960
that if you come across an intelligent alien from a different civilization,

223
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,360
what would you say the worst thing humanity has done and what would you say as humanity's

224
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:56,640
greatest achievement? Well, it relates very much to, you know, my idea of technology,

225
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,080
you know, letting, letting advancements in technology go beyond who we are and what we

226
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:07,920
are as human beings. That's very dangerous. It's almost, I think about like this last Dream Theater

227
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,360
album that we just made, the astonishing where the robots have kind of taken over.

228
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,560
Mm hmm. So I think that it's a matter of kind of like control and purpose and values. You know,

229
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:21,520
some humanity has a tendency of letting things kind of get out of spiral, out of control,

230
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:28,960
where we create things that are just beyond our, our spectrum of, you know, reach and physical,

231
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:35,520
mental capability. So there's nothing wrong with computers, but I just, I really value the part

232
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,760
where we're in touch with them, where we're controlling them, where we're, you know, we as a, as a

233
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:48,080
people have, you know, have the, have the kind of core value, the control, the power,

234
00:22:48,080 --> 00:23:06,080
and we don't just let it all go to, to this, you know, kind of digital self-control way of operating.

235
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:28,080
Mm hmm.
