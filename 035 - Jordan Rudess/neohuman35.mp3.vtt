00:00.000 --> 00:05.840
What I really am most interested in though is how you take technology and how you apply it to

00:05.840 --> 00:11.360
who we are as human beings. How do you take what we can do physically and emotionally and transfer

00:11.360 --> 00:14.880
that into the possibility of making expressive music.

00:14.880 --> 00:30.320
Hello and welcome to the 35th episode of Neo Human Podcast. I'm a Ghabhari agologist on Twitter and

00:30.320 --> 00:36.160
Instagram and you can follow the show on liveinlimbo.com, iTunes and YouTube.

00:36.960 --> 00:43.200
With me today, I have the pleasure of having Jordan Rudis. Welcome to Neo Human Podcast, Jordan.

00:43.200 --> 00:49.440
Thank you. You've been involved in music in one way or another since the 60s. How music has evolved

00:49.440 --> 00:54.320
since then and would it be fair to say that technology has had a direct role in the evolution

00:54.320 --> 01:05.040
of the music itself? Absolutely. I mean, I grew up personally as a trained concert pianist. I was

01:05.040 --> 01:12.160
being groomed to be a concert pianist and, you know, when I was 17 or 18, I started to discover

01:12.160 --> 01:17.280
all about synthesizers and I just watched so many changes. But I would say the main change with

01:17.280 --> 01:24.400
technology and the way that the music has changed is that there was this old argument in the early

01:24.400 --> 01:30.640
days of synthesis where people were saying that there's just not the ability to be expressive or

01:30.640 --> 01:36.960
shall we say organic with sound. And now I think that it's impossible, unless you're completely

01:36.960 --> 01:42.880
blind and live in the dark, it's impossible to make that argument because the capabilities of

01:42.880 --> 01:50.080
making music using technology have brought it to a point where the instruments are so sensitive,

01:50.080 --> 01:58.480
so organic. An example being, you know, like the instrument called the seaboard that I worked on

01:58.480 --> 02:04.960
the last few years. It's a very expressive new kind of instrument. So yeah, so I think that that

02:04.960 --> 02:09.840
has brought a lot of changes about and also, you know, the ability to just, you know, continue this

02:09.840 --> 02:14.320
kind of sonic exploration, which is possible through the advancement of synthesis itself,

02:14.320 --> 02:20.240
being able to not only make different kinds of sounds, but also to be able to play with sounds

02:20.240 --> 02:28.000
in the spatial domain have changed things up a lot as well. So would it be fair to say that in music,

02:28.000 --> 02:33.360
as well as everywhere else in our life that we see today, the line between digital and analog is

02:33.360 --> 02:39.760
becoming more and more blurry? Yeah, I would say that. I'd definitely say that because the fluidity

02:40.880 --> 02:46.960
of control has gotten so great that you kind of you definitely lose that kind of

02:47.840 --> 02:52.560
the feeling that you're, you know, working in steps, and it rather feels more, you know,

02:52.560 --> 02:59.200
closer to like the human spirit and what people think of as analog. Yeah. We talk a lot about

02:59.200 --> 03:04.400
how automation is affecting industries across the board with the assumption that creative fields

03:04.400 --> 03:09.600
are more difficult to automate. However, we have seen that through machine learning, AIs have

03:09.600 --> 03:14.720
composed songs, written novels and screenplays. We've seen the hologram Hatsune Miku becoming

03:14.720 --> 03:20.160
number one pop star in Japan and music composed by Squarepusher performed entirely by the Japanese

03:20.160 --> 03:25.200
robots, Banshee machines. How do you see technology affecting music and musicians themselves going

03:25.200 --> 03:32.480
forward? Well, I think I see all different types of technology. You know, it's a world where every

03:32.480 --> 03:38.240
day we wake up and there's something else amazing that we hear about, you know, whether it's a machine

03:38.240 --> 03:45.200
playing an instrument or some kind of a piece that was written by a computer and less, you know, and

03:45.200 --> 03:50.160
well, less and less human involvement, or maybe some technologies where there are where there is,

03:50.160 --> 03:54.400
you know, some kind of participation or interaction and some that are not. But I guess

03:54.400 --> 04:00.720
what I care about what I'm I like, you know, I'm into gadgets. I like all technology. I think it's,

04:00.720 --> 04:06.080
you know, it's cool for a robot to play a musical instrument. What I really am most interested in,

04:06.080 --> 04:10.960
though, is how you take technology and how you apply it to who we are as human beings.

04:11.600 --> 04:17.040
How do you take what we can do physically and emotionally and transfer that into the possibility

04:17.040 --> 04:23.120
of making expressive music? So, you know, growing up on the piano, the piano is a very beautiful

04:23.120 --> 04:30.000
instrument. But it's, you know, there's a point where you can say, OK, well, you can only do so

04:30.000 --> 04:36.080
much because once your finger, it's once your finger presses down on a key, the hammer hits

04:36.080 --> 04:40.000
the string and the sound is in the air. And then you're controlling the sound in a way, but you're

04:40.000 --> 04:45.680
not involved with the sound at every moment. An example of an instrument, an older instrument that

04:45.680 --> 04:50.080
that has, you know, a great level of control would be something like a violin or even a wind

04:50.080 --> 04:55.280
instrument where you're, you know, we're in charge of the note at every given second, the dynamics,

04:55.280 --> 05:00.960
the pitch. But the more control you have at every moment, I think the better. And I'm excited about

05:00.960 --> 05:06.080
technology that really allows us to express and gives us more control of making the music. But

05:06.080 --> 05:12.240
not only that, but maybe things that give us more information as well. So as you're playing,

05:12.240 --> 05:18.480
you can actually see or feel what's going on to help kind of bring the performance to a higher

05:18.480 --> 05:22.960
level. These are the kind of things that I spend a lot of time thinking about, like when I released

05:22.960 --> 05:29.120
my first application with my wisdom music company and we produced MorphWiz, although now you go back

05:29.120 --> 05:35.120
and it's a pretty simple application. The concept of it was very strong, which was that I wanted to

05:35.840 --> 05:45.040
give the user a way to work with sound and morph between waveforms, but not only sonic waveforms,

05:45.040 --> 05:52.160
but also visual waveforms and have a large area to express that. So you're hearing the sound,

05:52.160 --> 05:58.240
you're seeing it, you're getting the information, there's even an entertainment aspect to it,

05:58.240 --> 06:03.200
but putting those all together is a good, that kind of thinking, I think is a good step towards

06:04.640 --> 06:09.280
what technology ideally could do for creative people, musicians.

06:09.280 --> 06:13.440
Yeah, absolutely. I was going to ask you about wisdom music. What inspired you to start it when

06:13.440 --> 06:18.240
you did? Because you started it quite early on, I would say maybe, was it 2009?

06:18.240 --> 06:23.440
Yeah, it was about eight years ago. It was when the first iPhones were being put out.

06:24.880 --> 06:33.760
What got me into it was that I had tried one of the very, very first iPhones and I thought,

06:34.560 --> 06:38.880
even though I was playing on a very primitive little piano that somebody put on the screen,

06:38.880 --> 06:45.200
like a one octave kind of thing, I had this feeling that on a multi-touch surface that more

06:45.200 --> 06:50.000
could be done. And there's actually a pretty funny story, which is that around that time,

06:50.000 --> 06:56.640
my wife and I had just purchased a beautiful nine foot Steinway grand for my, I think that's like

06:56.640 --> 07:02.880
for my 50th birthday at that point. And instead of playing the piano a lot, I would sit around and

07:02.880 --> 07:10.160
just make this ridiculous sound on my new Apple device. And she looked at me one day and said,

07:10.160 --> 07:14.400
why are you making that horrible sound on that thing? And I was like, no, no, no, I have an idea.

07:14.400 --> 07:21.200
I really have an idea here. Leave me alone. I got something in mind. So it was maybe one of the

07:21.200 --> 07:27.360
few times that I was right. And I did have some pretty cool idea about a way to think about using

07:27.360 --> 07:36.400
a multi-touch surface to make music. And then later on I produced MorphWiz. So my desire was

07:37.280 --> 07:43.440
to really take these multi-touch surfaces and figure out how to make music with them. What

07:43.440 --> 07:50.160
the best way to do that would be. And I realized that by being able to have control of a whole

07:50.160 --> 07:54.640
playing surface or whole area like that, that each finger could kind of have an individual

07:54.640 --> 08:00.880
identity and have room to express. And so that's kind of one of the driving

08:01.680 --> 08:06.400
courses in what I do with the music. I think cost is also a very important factor

08:06.400 --> 08:09.680
because I remember when I was a kid, we couldn't afford the piano. We ended up with

08:11.280 --> 08:16.800
one of the CT models that was like tenth of a price. So it's becoming more available to more

08:16.800 --> 08:22.400
people. They can make more music. And I think I used to have a VL tone. I think that was an

08:22.400 --> 08:29.360
inspiration to me as well. It was a Casio model that did some pretty cool things. But yeah,

08:29.360 --> 08:34.720
I think this generation, it's amazing to think that what they carry around in their pockets,

08:34.720 --> 08:42.000
whether it's an iOS device or an Android device or Windows, whatever, you can do things on these

08:42.000 --> 08:46.560
little devices we walk around with. But you just can't do almost every product that you'd find in

08:46.560 --> 08:51.680
a music store. As far as what kind of visuals you might see on your device when you're making

08:51.680 --> 08:58.240
the music or some kind of multi-touch expression that you can do by playing a note and moving your

08:58.240 --> 09:03.040
finger on it and changing the sonic parameters while you're holding the note. I mean, it's

09:03.040 --> 09:08.400
incredible. It's almost like we're playing catch up now in the hardware world to bring it up to

09:08.400 --> 09:14.560
speed with what people expect from the little apps that they can buy on their iOS device.

09:14.560 --> 09:20.480
And not only that, I think that the young musicians, people who are really interested

09:20.480 --> 09:25.120
in music that want to get into music, I think that instead of maybe going to a guitar center

09:25.120 --> 09:32.000
or something like that, they can go to the Apple app store and get a GeoShred or some other app

09:32.000 --> 09:39.600
that lets them into a pretty deep world of music for very few dollars. Yeah, that completely new

09:39.600 --> 09:43.280
approach. They're talking about how malls are going out of business in the US. Do you think

09:43.280 --> 09:49.600
the same thing will happen to music stores? I think that we've seen it happening,

09:49.600 --> 09:55.360
unfortunately, because I like music stores and I like record stores. I miss them when they change.

09:56.400 --> 10:02.560
But I really do think that there's going to be a big movement, and there already is,

10:02.560 --> 10:07.120
towards people realizing that they can get really great instruments on their iPad.

10:07.760 --> 10:13.360
So what does that mean? I don't know. We have to figure out what that all means and how to make

10:13.360 --> 10:18.880
it work. But that's what I think is happening. You said in 2014 that streaming music services

10:18.880 --> 10:24.320
won't allow creative musicians to survive. Do you still think like that? Would you expand on that?

10:25.440 --> 10:31.520
I think that there's a big problem there. I think that everybody's trying to count on streaming music

10:31.520 --> 10:37.920
as a way that musicians will hopefully be able to stay alive. Because there's so many services

10:37.920 --> 10:43.040
now and that's where things are going and people aren't buying CDs anymore. It's almost like a

10:43.040 --> 10:50.560
desperation thought that that's what's going to be happening. Personally, I'm putting my time into

10:52.720 --> 11:00.240
other kinds of ideas. I'm about to launch, as an example, a new platform called ArtistCo,

11:00.240 --> 11:08.720
A-R-T-I-S-T-C-O, in about two weeks. And it's a system that is based on artists supporting each

11:08.720 --> 11:17.760
other. Fans, die-hard fans supporting the artist. It's very much kind of an affiliate type of an

11:17.760 --> 11:21.920
idea. But just to give you an example of the way that it could work is if you're an artist and

11:21.920 --> 11:27.840
you're over in China with a million followers and I'm Jordan Rudis here. Well, right now I'm in

11:27.840 --> 11:34.560
Munich, but let's say I'm at home in the US. I would then post a link that says, please check out

11:34.560 --> 11:41.520
Zhao Yitong's music in China and everybody who follows that link would go to his ArtistCo site

11:41.520 --> 11:46.960
and when they sign up for it, then I would get a small percentage of the sign up fee. So it's about

11:46.960 --> 11:54.240
artists supporting each other and really turning on the fan bases to each other's music and gaining

11:54.240 --> 12:01.920
support and financial support from that kind of a mechanism. So that's the kind of thing that I

12:01.920 --> 12:06.480
think has a lot of possibility for the future where the artist goes directly to the fan. It's

12:06.480 --> 12:12.800
very much the kind of independent artist thinking that there's a bunch of artists that are leaning

12:12.800 --> 12:17.280
towards that where you kind of get rid of the middle man and you do it yourself. And that

12:17.280 --> 12:22.400
doesn't necessarily, that doesn't really involve the streaming services. It involves more allowing

12:22.400 --> 12:35.360
fans to have access to an area where you put your material. Is it only on the distribution side or

12:35.360 --> 12:41.760
do you also, let's say Jordan Rudis has a part and some drummer in Mongolia adds something cool to

12:41.760 --> 12:47.520
it and Jordan Rudis and the Mongolian drummer end up making the music together? This particular

12:47.520 --> 12:52.720
service at this point, at least when it's released, will not be, it's not a service that allows like

12:52.720 --> 12:57.760
jamming together. It's not about that. It's more about releasing music, things maybe you've never

12:57.760 --> 13:02.480
heard before or things you have heard before, even if it's educational materials or it could be

13:02.480 --> 13:08.960
videos. So it's more about distributing the art rather than it's about collaborating.

13:09.920 --> 13:16.480
Right. Streaming in a way itself seems to have emerged as an alternative to and as a solution

13:16.480 --> 13:20.640
for pirating, but then it created a whole bunch of new challenges on its own. What do you think can

13:20.640 --> 13:27.520
be a good replacement for streaming services, if anything, or do we need to shift our attention to

13:27.520 --> 13:35.440
a completely different form than streaming? Well, as somebody who loves music, I mean, first of all,

13:35.440 --> 13:40.720
I can really appreciate the idea of streaming. I think it's good. I just think the biggest problem

13:40.720 --> 13:47.360
with it is monetization of the artist. There's just no real money to speak of that's going to

13:47.360 --> 13:53.840
the artist to keep the artists alive. So that's the reason that I'm investing time and resources

13:53.840 --> 13:58.880
into like ArtistCo, because I think it's a way that artists can actually stay alive. I think

13:58.880 --> 14:04.880
that's crucial. I mean, as a listener, I think, okay, well, Spotify or the Apple Music system,

14:04.880 --> 14:11.200
those are really, really great things. The Pandora system, the new premium is great. It's all good

14:11.200 --> 14:14.720
from a listener's point of view, but how much money is the artist going to make? And can they

14:14.720 --> 14:24.080
really continue to do their art form with that kind of service? I don't think so. I think it's

14:24.080 --> 14:30.240
really got to change. Right. It seems to be the culture of consumers and music listeners also

14:30.240 --> 14:35.280
need to change to realize that it's true that you can't get a piece of music for free, but

14:35.280 --> 14:40.560
if you want that artist that you like to continue making music, you need to pay for it. That's

14:40.560 --> 14:45.600
right. Yeah, it's a cultural thing where everybody thinks they can get everything for free. And it's

14:45.600 --> 14:50.880
very difficult. I mean, it's difficult to a point, but then it's even more difficult beyond that.

14:50.880 --> 14:59.200
And one example is even on my own, like I love to be in my piano room at home, but it's

14:59.200 --> 15:02.880
piano room at home and say, oh, I feel like improvising. And then I can just turn on my

15:02.880 --> 15:08.880
iPhone and point it to the piano and go hit Facebook live. And the next thing you know,

15:08.880 --> 15:14.880
I'm playing for a few thousand people around the world on a moment's notice. And it's really nice.

15:14.880 --> 15:20.160
But there's the side of that that's not so great, which is that, yes, it's great as a fan. You can

15:20.160 --> 15:28.880
tune in, you can listen to me play, but there's no financial interest in that. So I'm just

15:28.880 --> 15:32.960
basically, not only am I giving it away, but I'm saying here, here's some more music for free.

15:32.960 --> 15:38.080
Right. And you've always jumped in right into anything new. I remember watching you at Stageit

15:38.080 --> 15:42.320
platform. You've been so innovative. And I think that's one of the problems that a lot of musicians

15:42.320 --> 15:47.440
have that they just ignore all this digital and new advancement. I'm like, well, this is not natural.

15:47.440 --> 15:52.240
This is not real music. Yeah. I think it's really important to pay attention to all those kinds of

15:52.240 --> 15:56.880
developments and be conscious of it because not only do I think it's fun, but I think it's

15:56.880 --> 16:01.120
important to understand where it's going and how each musician can kind of contribute to where it

16:01.120 --> 16:07.280
should be going. Right. So do you think that's the constant reformation in music as a result

16:07.280 --> 16:14.160
of technology calls for constant reformation in the music industry and the music and musicianship

16:14.160 --> 16:21.120
itself? Yeah, I think that, well, you know, a lot of this, a lot of the industry is just kind of

16:21.120 --> 16:27.280
blinded at this point by a incredible desire to, to, to maintain, you know, what they have or

16:27.280 --> 16:33.360
necessity. The business. Yeah. They just need to do whatever they can to stay employed and keep it

16:33.360 --> 16:38.400
alive. And, and as far as the musicians go, a lot of, you know, most musicians out there don't even

16:38.400 --> 16:44.000
don't understand what's, uh, you know, what the new world is all about. They live in a space where

16:44.000 --> 16:48.560
they're kind of thinking that, you know, it should be like what used to be happening. One of the

16:48.560 --> 16:53.680
challenges is that, um, you know, many of the musician friends that I have that I grew up with

16:53.680 --> 17:01.760
don't get this kind of, um, idea that the musician is going to be so close with the fans and like

17:01.760 --> 17:06.960
where the fan can actually have access to them. They feel like this got to be the separation.

17:06.960 --> 17:12.880
And so it creates a real roadblock to kind of, uh, allowing the new technologies to work for them.

17:12.880 --> 17:18.640
That's a very good point. And to even, and to even be part of figuring out how and where we should be

17:18.640 --> 17:22.960
moving to, because, you know, as soon as a fan gets close, they go, Oh, this doesn't, this is not

17:22.960 --> 17:27.040
right. They're supposed to be at a distance and I'm supposed to be up here on a, you know, on a

17:27.040 --> 17:31.920
throne or something like that. And that's what creates the celebrity magic. Well, I mean, things,

17:31.920 --> 17:35.600
you know, move very fast and unfortunately that's not the way that business works, that the music

17:35.600 --> 17:41.440
business works and that's not what the fans want. And, uh, we have to, we have to start, you know,

17:41.440 --> 17:45.840
as a culture, kind of embracing this new way of thinking. Some of us are more comfortable with

17:45.840 --> 17:50.960
that and some of us are just not, you know, but I think that, uh, you know, I watch musician friends

17:50.960 --> 17:56.960
every day kind of go, Oh, wow. Oh, I see. Yeah. Okay. And step by step, they're being kind of

17:56.960 --> 18:01.600
almost led into this new direction. And, you know, and those who are smart, they're open,

18:01.600 --> 18:06.240
we'll get it. And others will just close down and, you know, and they'll be kind of left behind.

18:06.240 --> 18:11.680
Yeah. That's a very good point. Let's talk a little bit, uh, a little bit about music. What

18:11.680 --> 18:17.360
is improvisation? Because I know you, um, you think of improvising, the ability to improvise

18:17.360 --> 18:21.760
is a very important factor, uh, to have as a musician. What is improvisation? Who is an

18:21.760 --> 18:28.080
improviser and how can an improviser improve his improvisational skill? Uh, it's a really good

18:28.080 --> 18:33.200
question. Um, improvisation, first of all, is something that is very, very important to me.

18:33.200 --> 18:39.120
It's something that I've always done even through all my years. Uh, at Julliard, I would be, I guess,

18:39.120 --> 18:44.720
a closet improviser, if you will, because it wasn't so much allowed in those, uh, in the

18:44.720 --> 18:52.560
Julliard, you know, halls. Um, but to me, the art of improvisation is, it's, it's like speaking a

18:52.560 --> 18:58.880
language. It's, it's very much speaking the language of music. Um, and what it means to me

18:58.880 --> 19:03.680
is that like, just personally, I could sit down with the piano and just start playing stuff that

19:03.680 --> 19:07.840
you've never heard before and do it, you know, for as long as I was sitting down with the piano,

19:07.840 --> 19:11.440
whether it's good or not, or whether it flows smoothly or not, there's different factors that

19:11.440 --> 19:18.160
that depends on things like, am I feeling relaxed? Am I, do I have other things on my mind? Um, you

19:18.160 --> 19:24.560
know, all kinds of things can get in the way, mental clutter, but generally it's, I very much

19:24.560 --> 19:30.240
think of it as a lot like speaking a language. Um, an example being, if I was feeling, uh,

19:30.240 --> 19:35.360
especially emotional about something, that's a great time for me to sit at the piano and express

19:35.360 --> 19:41.760
that with music. And what makes that possible to even improvise, to make up stuff on the spot,

19:41.760 --> 19:46.400
is to have tools to do that. Like when you learn a language, you learn words, you learn to connect

19:46.400 --> 19:52.400
words and make sentences to express in their phrases. Well, in music, you need, you need to

19:52.400 --> 19:57.360
connect notes together. You need to connect harmony together. You need to know that, you know,

19:57.360 --> 20:01.600
these certain kinds of chords, if you put them together, they will express a certain feeling

20:01.600 --> 20:08.560
or create a certain kind of vibe. If you're not familiar with any of those harmonic melodic tools,

20:09.600 --> 20:13.520
any of the rhythmic tools, then you're not going to be able to speak the language.

20:13.520 --> 20:18.560
First of all, if you don't like, uh, if you don't know any kind of theory and, or if you don't have

20:18.560 --> 20:24.080
a good ear for music, you can't hear what a harmonic change is going to sound like in your head

20:24.080 --> 20:31.120
before you hit the note. Your chance of speaking the language, uh, is very limited. However,

20:31.120 --> 20:35.520
if you have some skill, some theoretical skill, and maybe even above that, if you have a good

20:35.520 --> 20:41.600
ear for music, meaning you can hear the notes in your head before your hand touches the instrument,

20:42.240 --> 20:47.920
then you can understand how to communicate that way because you can start putting things together.

20:47.920 --> 20:52.080
So it's very much about developing tools, maybe, you know, even if it's practicing scales or

20:52.080 --> 20:57.440
arpeggios or chord patterns in different keys so that when you do sit down, you can express and

20:57.440 --> 21:02.960
you can play in a style. You know, if somebody, one of the challenges, one of the things I like

21:02.960 --> 21:07.360
to try to do, and sometimes I'm more successful than other times, but one of the things if somebody

21:07.360 --> 21:11.280
says, well, Jordan, play something that's like a Chopin nocturne. And I sit down and I play and I,

21:11.280 --> 21:16.080
you know, I can go and I can speak, you know, I can, I can go into that and start speaking

21:16.080 --> 21:21.600
language. Or somebody says, play something jazzy or, you know, new agey or Genesis-like. I know,

21:21.600 --> 21:26.640
you know, I spent time with the chords. I developed them. I understand many of the changes and

21:26.640 --> 21:30.800
I can go into that mode. So I hope that answers a bit of that question.

21:30.800 --> 21:35.200
Yeah, absolutely. Jordan, I know your time is limited. I hope we get a chance to have a more

21:35.200 --> 21:40.880
in-depth conversation in the future. But let me ask you the last question I ask all my guests,

21:40.880 --> 21:44.960
that if you come across an intelligent alien from a different civilization,

21:44.960 --> 21:49.360
what would you say the worst thing humanity has done and what would you say as humanity's

21:49.360 --> 21:56.640
greatest achievement? Well, it relates very much to, you know, my idea of technology,

21:56.640 --> 22:02.080
you know, letting, letting advancements in technology go beyond who we are and what we

22:02.080 --> 22:07.920
are as human beings. That's very dangerous. It's almost, I think about like this last Dream Theater

22:07.920 --> 22:11.360
album that we just made, the astonishing where the robots have kind of taken over.

22:11.360 --> 22:16.560
Mm hmm. So I think that it's a matter of kind of like control and purpose and values. You know,

22:16.560 --> 22:21.520
some humanity has a tendency of letting things kind of get out of spiral, out of control,

22:21.520 --> 22:28.960
where we create things that are just beyond our, our spectrum of, you know, reach and physical,

22:28.960 --> 22:35.520
mental capability. So there's nothing wrong with computers, but I just, I really value the part

22:35.520 --> 22:41.760
where we're in touch with them, where we're controlling them, where we're, you know, we as a, as a

22:41.920 --> 22:48.080
people have, you know, have the, have the kind of core value, the control, the power,

22:48.080 --> 23:06.080
and we don't just let it all go to, to this, you know, kind of digital self-control way of operating.

23:18.080 --> 23:28.080
Mm hmm.
