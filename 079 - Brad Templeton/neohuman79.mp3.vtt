00:00.000 --> 00:06.080
I believe that we are machines and in the full formal definition of a machine, obviously

00:06.080 --> 00:08.720
we're not gears and oil.

00:08.720 --> 00:12.880
And so of course machines can have spiritual experiences because we are machines and we

00:12.880 --> 00:21.760
have them.

00:21.760 --> 00:27.280
Hello and welcome to the 79th episode of Neohuman Podcasts, I'm Agabahari Adygologist on Twitter

00:27.280 --> 00:28.280
and Instagram.

00:28.280 --> 00:32.840
You can follow this show on LiveInLimbo.com, iTunes, YouTube, BitChute, and at some point

00:32.840 --> 00:33.840
on Spotify.

00:33.840 --> 00:36.360
And today with me, I have Brad Templeton.

00:36.360 --> 00:38.320
Welcome to Neohuman Podcasts, Brad.

00:38.320 --> 00:40.760
Yes, hi, good to be here.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.000
Pleasure to have you.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.720
And just to give our audience some kind of a context where your thoughts and opinions

00:45.720 --> 00:49.600
are coming from, let's start with your background, the work you've done, the lives you've lived

00:49.600 --> 00:51.880
and what are you mainly focused on now these days?

00:51.880 --> 00:53.760
Oh, I mean, I have to do that.

00:53.760 --> 00:57.640
It's always much more self-aggrandizing when you have to do that.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.040
You get the host to do that.

00:59.040 --> 01:03.760
Well, I've done a lot of different things, all pretty much related to computers and high

01:03.760 --> 01:10.320
tech, but I started out in the software field, wrote a dozen software packages back in the

01:10.320 --> 01:14.200
80s, games and tools and things like that.

01:14.200 --> 01:19.560
Got probably, well, the other two things that made people know me were one was in the 80s,

01:19.560 --> 01:25.000
the internet was growing and I hosted what would be considered the first or one of the

01:25.000 --> 01:29.760
first blog type things, a publication of comedy that was the most widely read thing on the

01:29.760 --> 01:32.720
internet for many years.

01:32.720 --> 01:38.560
But then I also started the first dot com, the first business on the internet, an electronic

01:38.560 --> 01:42.400
newspaper back then, which I built during the 90s.

01:42.400 --> 01:50.040
That was started in Waterloo, Ontario, a town you may know, but I moved it to Silicon Valley.

01:50.040 --> 01:54.120
Since then, after selling that, I've been involved in a lot of different ventures and

01:54.120 --> 01:55.720
the nonprofit work.

01:55.720 --> 02:00.160
I was 20 years at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is a civil rights group.

02:00.160 --> 02:05.320
It does free speech, privacy, these things in the computer world.

02:05.320 --> 02:10.920
Forsythe Institute, an organization devoted to nanotechnology and futurist technologies,

02:10.920 --> 02:15.160
went to work on self-driving cars, got very interested in them, got invited to work on

02:15.160 --> 02:18.440
Google's self-driving car during its first few years.

02:18.440 --> 02:21.960
It's now known as Waymo.

02:21.960 --> 02:31.600
And let's see, also helped build a fake university called Singularity University, which tries

02:31.600 --> 02:36.600
to help people understand the effects of rapidly changing technology and that during the previous

02:36.600 --> 02:38.040
decade.

02:38.040 --> 02:44.440
And all along, I've been writing and talking and inventing in those fields.

02:44.440 --> 02:49.600
How has the internet world has changed and changed the world since its early days where

02:49.600 --> 02:52.800
you were there, present, right there?

02:52.800 --> 02:53.800
Not much.

02:53.800 --> 02:54.800
Really?

02:54.800 --> 02:55.800
No, of course not.

02:55.800 --> 03:00.240
I mean, I don't know how you can ask that's a very broad question.

03:00.240 --> 03:03.880
How has the internet changed the world?

03:03.880 --> 03:09.840
I mean, it's probably the, I mean, you could say the computer is the most significant invention

03:09.840 --> 03:13.000
of recent days because it sits underneath all those, but of the things the computer

03:13.000 --> 03:18.560
did, the internet probably changed people's lives more than any of them.

03:18.560 --> 03:24.080
And one obvious reaction that we're all experiencing right now is that if we had wanted to do a

03:24.080 --> 03:30.920
lockdown to stop a disease from spreading 20 years ago, what we're doing today, everyone

03:30.920 --> 03:36.160
working from home, everybody meeting all the time by video calls and so on, that would

03:36.160 --> 03:37.160
just not even be possible.

03:37.160 --> 03:38.600
So the lockdown wouldn't be possible.

03:38.600 --> 03:42.160
It might not be possible to fight that kind of disease.

03:42.160 --> 03:45.240
So that's just one example.

03:45.240 --> 03:52.080
I am one of several who, back in 2005, I wrote an essay saying, you know, a pandemic is going

03:52.080 --> 03:55.760
to come and at least this time, and I outlined all the things we're doing, we'll all be

03:55.760 --> 04:00.160
doing classes at home, we'll all be working at home and getting deliveries of everything

04:00.160 --> 04:01.420
we order online.

04:01.420 --> 04:02.420
And that has happened.

04:02.420 --> 04:05.760
Unfortunately, the other things that I predicted or advised didn't happen.

04:05.760 --> 04:10.940
So not everything changes, but you'll have to get a little more specific with a question

04:10.940 --> 04:11.940
like that.

04:11.940 --> 04:18.240
One of the reasons I ask is because this democratization of information seems to have brought a lot

04:18.240 --> 04:22.600
of liberty for people, but at the same time have brought a lot of confusion that some

04:22.600 --> 04:26.460
people are making the argument that we've never been this divided.

04:26.460 --> 04:31.120
But my argument is that we probably have always been this divided, but it just hasn't been

04:31.120 --> 04:32.280
heard.

04:32.280 --> 04:36.840
Now we have channels and access to those channels to be heard and, you know, contribute with

04:36.840 --> 04:42.080
our ideas and everybody seems to be, you know, basically ringing their own bells.

04:42.080 --> 04:46.600
Well I think what you say is true to an extent, but and I used to say it wholeheartedly.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.920
I don't say it so wholeheartedly now.

04:48.920 --> 04:54.080
I think that one thing that none of us, I would say none, I'm sure there were a few,

04:54.080 --> 05:00.400
but very few people accounted for, was the extent that propaganda could be a digital

05:00.400 --> 05:02.080
weapon.

05:02.080 --> 05:06.960
And so that, I think that has changed and is going to get worse.

05:06.960 --> 05:13.040
We're seeing that people, you know, countries, nations, and are attempting to use propaganda

05:13.040 --> 05:15.320
in an entirely new and different way.

05:15.320 --> 05:20.000
Targeting people individually, targeting people with just exactly the messages to push their

05:20.000 --> 05:25.400
buttons and get them to fight each other more than they would have fought each other in

05:25.400 --> 05:26.400
the past.

05:26.400 --> 05:30.120
Yes, we've always had differing opinions.

05:30.120 --> 05:35.880
We didn't tend to have our own facts so much and what's become clear is that populations

05:35.880 --> 05:41.120
are now isolating where they get the information from and each source is slanted in particular

05:41.120 --> 05:42.120
ways.

05:42.120 --> 05:47.680
It's, you know, mostly people in my community say, oh God, it's the right to have this

05:47.680 --> 05:50.680
worse and they're watching Fox News or whatever they're doing.

05:50.680 --> 05:54.880
But the truth is every side is getting its own particular collection of information.

05:54.880 --> 06:01.280
It's very hard to try and remove the biases from the media that you consume and, you know,

06:01.280 --> 06:05.000
we didn't anticipate that we anticipated, at least I anticipated that you would socialize

06:05.000 --> 06:08.320
with your friends online because I was doing that in the 1980s.

06:08.320 --> 06:13.080
In fact, it was one of the, what I'll call the great realizations of my life was back

06:13.080 --> 06:16.840
in a long time ago now, back in about 1981.

06:16.840 --> 06:22.560
I first got, oh, I've gotten on the ARPANET in 79 but I got on it for a day to day basis

06:22.560 --> 06:28.840
a year or two later and at that time everyone thought computer networks were for computers

06:28.840 --> 06:34.160
to talk to computers and, you know, exchange data, share files, that sort of stuff.

06:34.160 --> 06:37.880
And the epiphany was, wow, no, no, this is for people to talk to people.

06:37.880 --> 06:43.360
This is for our communication and not just for business but for socialization and a lot

06:43.360 --> 06:46.840
of the things in my career have been based on that epiphany and everyone else pretty

06:46.840 --> 06:48.960
much agrees with it today.

06:48.960 --> 06:53.240
But what was, should have seen more of the dark side of that, I guess.

06:53.240 --> 06:55.680
Yeah, I guess they come together, right?

06:55.680 --> 06:57.760
The light and darkness?

06:57.760 --> 07:02.600
They always do and in fact, you are, even the funny thing is you make this mistake even

07:02.600 --> 07:07.940
though you know the truth but it is a very common and foolish mistake to not look at

07:07.940 --> 07:12.520
any new technology and say, okay, what will bad people do with this?

07:12.520 --> 07:15.800
And I mean, we always think that, we always ask that question, we're always seeing bad

07:15.800 --> 07:20.720
people do things but I don't know why but we missed the idea that someone like Vladimir

07:20.720 --> 07:27.040
Putin would attempt to, you know, manipulate a country from the outside at a very deep

07:27.040 --> 07:31.840
detail and inside, you know, countries have done propaganda, they've done these sort of

07:31.840 --> 07:37.700
things but it was dropping leaflets from airplanes or having radio free, you know, radio stations.

07:37.700 --> 07:40.720
It was not the way it's become.

07:40.720 --> 07:45.560
It's also that the arbitration of good and bad has been democratized in a way that now

07:45.560 --> 07:50.000
a mob of people on Twitter can decide who is a bad person based on maybe one comment

07:50.000 --> 07:56.020
that that person has made 10 years ago, 15 years ago which brings a really big concern

07:56.020 --> 08:00.480
that how this whole thing is going to evolve considering how you mentioned we don't agree

08:00.480 --> 08:07.060
on facts anymore, how this world with all this arbitration of good and bad plus technologies

08:07.060 --> 08:11.600
like deep fake that are being easier and easier for people to just make up stuff from ground

08:11.600 --> 08:18.200
up is going to affect this sociopolitical, very fragile sociopolitical dynamic that we're

08:18.200 --> 08:19.200
dealing with right now.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.720
Well, you had two things in there.

08:21.720 --> 08:24.320
I'll briefly touch on deep fakes.

08:24.320 --> 08:28.600
While they're scary, if you think about it, of course, there's nothing in text which is

08:28.600 --> 08:29.600
inherently true.

08:29.600 --> 08:34.440
If someone sends you a written article saying something, you know that well, you know, anyone

08:34.440 --> 08:38.240
could write that and you have something in your brain that says I should see whether

08:38.240 --> 08:40.720
that's believable, I should see whether that's true.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.320
With video, you don't have that.

08:42.320 --> 08:47.020
You sort of think if I see it, it must be true and what I'm hoping is that we'll lose

08:47.020 --> 08:53.240
that sense that we'll see a video and we'll say okay, that's a video but, you know, videos

08:53.240 --> 08:57.860
are no more real than text and at least I hope because if not, if we start believing

08:57.860 --> 09:02.760
everything we see in video is true, we are going to get more riled up.

09:02.760 --> 09:06.760
But you touched on I think the deeper issue, one that we have not figured our way out of

09:06.760 --> 09:18.440
at all which is, you know, becoming mobs and this very tempting but dangerous vigilante

09:18.440 --> 09:24.320
justice which on the one hand, you think well, hey, that's just people expressing themselves.

09:24.320 --> 09:32.480
It's certainly allowed and it is but, you know, we actually have centuries of experience

09:32.480 --> 09:35.720
where we sort of laid down the principles of justice and how they should work.

09:35.720 --> 09:41.280
The idea of people having been presumed innocent until they're proven guilty and not being

09:41.280 --> 09:47.240
punished until that happens of metering out punishment to fit the crime and to perform

09:47.240 --> 09:55.400
not a retribution role but, you know, a deterrent and a rehabilitation role.

09:55.400 --> 10:01.240
Principles of evidence, principles of rights of the accused, rights of everyone involved

10:01.240 --> 10:07.160
and we built those systems of justice over hundreds of years because we saw what goes

10:07.160 --> 10:10.280
wrong when you don't apply those principles.

10:10.280 --> 10:16.760
Unfortunately, we have now discovered this new way to get not justice but retribution

10:16.760 --> 10:23.320
and we're clearly not being very good about it and we all feel very satisfied, haha, there's

10:23.320 --> 10:28.560
that person and I saw a video what looks like they were racist so I'm going to make them

10:28.560 --> 10:34.640
lose their job and I'm not saying people should be racist or we shouldn't be disapproving

10:34.640 --> 10:40.560
of people who are racist but sometimes the penalty is, you know, total annihilation from

10:40.560 --> 10:48.800
society for an offhand remark which is not appropriate meeting out of justice and I don't

10:48.800 --> 10:51.480
know actually what's going to be the solution to that.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.960
Now here's an example with respect to autonomous vehicle.

10:53.960 --> 10:58.720
There is the ethical dilemma with respect to autonomous cars that if you come across

10:58.720 --> 11:04.680
a crossroad, there is no ethical dilemma now just in this example that I'm trying to make

11:04.680 --> 11:09.120
a point out of, that you come across a crossroad and one is blocked, you can kill yourself

11:09.120 --> 11:13.960
for example and the other has a baby in it or an old man in it, which one would you choose?

11:13.960 --> 11:19.240
Now if this kind of mob mentality get into a justice system and say that, hey, if you

11:19.240 --> 11:23.220
for example kill a black person that is not okay but if you kill a white person that would

11:23.220 --> 11:27.480
be okay with an autonomous vehicle, would that be a possibility?

11:27.480 --> 11:30.960
I don't know about that one but getting back to your question of who the car would run

11:30.960 --> 11:36.840
over, that I do have an answer for which is they're keeping track of who asks that question

11:36.840 --> 11:40.400
and they're going to run over the people who ask that question.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.400
That is the plan.

11:41.400 --> 11:45.200
The reality is, does this happen to you a lot?

11:45.200 --> 11:48.360
Have you often been driving and had to decide whether to kill yourself or a baby?

11:48.360 --> 11:49.720
No, not at all.

11:49.720 --> 11:51.480
Have you ever heard of it happening to someone else?

11:51.480 --> 11:55.080
No, I've read a lot of arguments about it though.

11:55.080 --> 11:58.800
It is not a real thing.

11:58.800 --> 12:02.880
What it is, is it's a morbid fascination that we have with the idea of a machine deciding

12:02.880 --> 12:05.320
who lives and who dies.

12:05.320 --> 12:12.120
So for us, that used to be for gods, not even for people to decide and so as soon as you

12:12.120 --> 12:15.880
start saying, what if a machine is deciding who lives and who dies, everyone goes, oh

12:15.880 --> 12:20.320
wow, that's like deep, oh, got to figure that out.

12:20.320 --> 12:23.880
In fact, no, it's an extremely rare situation.

12:23.880 --> 12:28.200
I've been looking around and I can't say I've never found an instance where something like

12:28.200 --> 12:34.020
that happened but it's just not the kind of thing that's anywhere on anyone's priority

12:34.020 --> 12:37.720
list about what to program a car to do.

12:37.720 --> 12:43.120
And secondly, there's almost always already an answer in the law about where a car should

12:43.120 --> 12:47.640
go because the law is actually full of a thousand rules about where the car can go and who has

12:47.640 --> 12:52.000
right away and who's supposed to yield and so the car will first and foremost obey the

12:52.000 --> 12:59.520
law and so it's long time before anyone will have to imagine a car having to make that

12:59.520 --> 13:04.720
decision and so the fact that worrying about it is actually the ethical problem because

13:04.720 --> 13:07.520
if you spend a lot of time worrying about that, you're not worrying about the things

13:07.520 --> 13:10.160
that actually matter and might actually save people's lives.

13:10.160 --> 13:14.840
What are some of the more important factors and elements that matter with respect to autonomous

13:14.840 --> 13:15.840
vehicles?

13:15.840 --> 13:21.240
Well, I mean everyone is set on a goal of making the car so that it's safe enough on

13:21.240 --> 13:26.080
the roads to be accepted by the public and to not create great liability for the people

13:26.080 --> 13:27.080
who put it out there.

13:27.080 --> 13:31.360
There's actually nothing, I mean there are moral concerns going on but in fact there's

13:31.360 --> 13:35.320
just very practical concerns which is the first you've got to build a car that you can

13:35.320 --> 13:40.120
prove to yourself is safe enough to put out there.

13:40.120 --> 13:43.920
Actually, that's the first people you have to convince is that you yourselves have done

13:43.920 --> 13:48.080
it, you have to convince your lawyers, your company's board of directors that it's time

13:48.080 --> 13:49.720
to put this vehicle out on the road.

13:49.720 --> 13:53.400
So that's the challenge everyone's working for is how can they make it safe enough that

13:53.400 --> 13:55.920
we feel comfortable doing it.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.840
Obviously you want the public to feel comfortable with it as well.

13:57.840 --> 14:01.560
Right now you don't actually have to make the government feel comfortable with it.

14:01.560 --> 14:06.400
Someday you might have to but here's a little dark secret no one seems to know, it's already

14:06.400 --> 14:08.260
illegal to hit people.

14:08.260 --> 14:11.920
We don't actually need another law that say that, we've got that law down there, it's

14:11.920 --> 14:16.560
probably the most tested law in the world.

14:16.560 --> 14:20.840
There's no tort that's more common in courts than a car accident.

14:20.840 --> 14:24.380
Actually it's not in the courts that much because it's in insurance companies but effectively

14:24.380 --> 14:25.720
in that sense.

14:25.720 --> 14:30.040
So that's what you got to do and so now of course that breaks down into a lot of different

14:30.040 --> 14:31.040
problems.

14:31.040 --> 14:34.880
Right now if you were to ask people what's your hardest problem that you're working on,

14:34.880 --> 14:39.800
I think a lot of them would say we want to get the computer better at predicting what

14:39.800 --> 14:41.400
humans will do.

14:41.400 --> 14:45.360
So you're driving down the road, is that car going to suddenly change lanes?

14:45.360 --> 14:49.360
Is that guy going to step into the crosswalk?

14:49.360 --> 14:52.640
This is something that humans are better than computers at predicting what other humans

14:52.640 --> 14:53.720
are thinking.

14:53.720 --> 14:58.320
So that would be the one thing that people are sort of pushing on and people are working

14:58.320 --> 15:01.280
on all the other problems as well, making sure that you see and understand everything

15:01.280 --> 15:07.720
in the road, that you know you can handle lots and lots of unusual situations.

15:07.720 --> 15:15.720
These are key problems everyone is always trying to improve on and eventually people

15:15.720 --> 15:19.240
argue about what level of safety they want to achieve.

15:19.240 --> 15:25.080
Most people sort of dance around the idea of let's make it better than the average person

15:25.080 --> 15:26.080
and I don't think that's unreasonable.

15:26.080 --> 15:29.160
Some people want to be much better than the average person, I don't actually think that's

15:29.160 --> 15:30.160
the right path.

15:30.160 --> 15:36.760
I think perfection is certainly not attainable and therefore not the right goal to go for.

15:36.760 --> 15:40.680
I even think there are arguments that you could make it just as good as a teenager with

15:40.680 --> 15:41.920
a freshly admitted driver's license.

15:41.920 --> 15:48.120
Now people would say that's not very safe but we certainly allow that on the road and

15:48.120 --> 15:55.480
we do it because that's how we turn those teenagers into more mature, better drivers.

15:55.480 --> 16:00.600
But the one trick is that when we make a teenager better with a driving course or some experience,

16:00.600 --> 16:02.720
we only make one teenager better.

16:02.720 --> 16:06.960
If we let robots go out there and get their experience and improve, we make all the robots

16:06.960 --> 16:10.440
better at the same time, at least all the ones from the same company.

16:10.440 --> 16:15.800
Yeah on the social level it just seems to me that people's immediate problem with machines

16:15.800 --> 16:20.720
is that they're going to replace humans, whether it's labor or decision making or anything

16:20.720 --> 16:25.360
like that and then a lot of arguments are being made using or maybe taking advantage

16:25.360 --> 16:31.320
of that concern coming from the side that they're fundamentally against automation,

16:31.320 --> 16:36.200
against autonomous vehicles, they make the ethical or moral kind of an argument, right?

16:36.200 --> 16:38.800
Yeah, it's reasonable to worry about that.

16:38.800 --> 16:43.960
I think some of that worry is not justified, I think some of it is.

16:43.960 --> 16:48.600
So far the history of machines replacing humans is actually not nearly as scary as people

16:48.600 --> 16:51.200
imagine back in the Industrial Revolution.

16:51.200 --> 16:55.400
In fact a famous statistic which astounds people is that there are more bank tellers

16:55.400 --> 17:00.320
today than in 1970 and if you were to say name me a job where the machine replaced a

17:00.320 --> 17:03.960
human everyone say well bank teller I don't go in and you know get cash from the human

17:03.960 --> 17:04.960
being anymore.

17:04.960 --> 17:11.280
Those bank tellers aren't handing you cash anymore of course, they're doing other things.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.880
But in fact we actually haven't done that much.

17:13.880 --> 17:14.880
Now will that change?

17:14.880 --> 17:20.560
But we've predicted that machines will take all the jobs for 150 years, every 10 years

17:20.560 --> 17:24.320
a big nasty book will come out warning how oh my god the machines are going to take all

17:24.320 --> 17:25.320
the jobs and guess what?

17:25.320 --> 17:26.720
It's wrong every time.

17:26.720 --> 17:29.120
Now is it someday going to be right?

17:29.120 --> 17:31.840
Maybe, maybe and should we think about it?

17:31.840 --> 17:35.720
Sure we should think about it but we should also understand why we're always wrong when

17:35.720 --> 17:39.720
we make the prediction and try and figure out how we can tell that oh this is the time

17:39.720 --> 17:43.760
where we're no longer always wrong, this is the time where it really happens.

17:43.760 --> 17:49.200
Now when it comes to driving well we got two kinds of people making their learning or making

17:49.200 --> 17:50.280
their living from driving.

17:50.280 --> 17:55.120
We do have you know all the uber cab drivers that sort of thing in the world and I don't

17:55.120 --> 17:59.520
want to deprecate these people but the truth is they don't think of that as a career.

17:59.520 --> 18:03.640
They didn't when they were little kids say I want to grow up and be a cab driver all

18:03.640 --> 18:04.640
right.

18:04.640 --> 18:07.720
They do that because it's kind of handy gig work they can set the hours, it doesn't take

18:07.720 --> 18:11.240
a lot of skill, you basically can go out there and work when you want and you've got a car

18:11.240 --> 18:15.080
and you make some money and I think that those people will go and do something else like

18:15.080 --> 18:18.040
that if driving isn't that great a way to make money with it.

18:18.040 --> 18:21.400
Sure uber and lift and those companies discovered a way that people could make money that way

18:21.400 --> 18:26.720
and they enabled a lot of people to make money that way but that didn't even exist 11 years

18:26.720 --> 18:27.840
ago.

18:27.840 --> 18:32.280
So cab driving existed but it was a much smaller profession.

18:32.280 --> 18:36.160
Then there's professional truck drivers those are real there's about three million of those

18:36.160 --> 18:38.700
in the United States.

18:38.700 --> 18:43.560
Now in the professional truck driving industry and long-haul driving in particular the turnover

18:43.560 --> 18:47.120
every year is often more than 100 percent.

18:47.120 --> 18:51.440
Basically that people leave more people leave the job than there are jobs so that they only

18:51.440 --> 18:54.120
last less than a year in the job that's what it means you can you think how could it be

18:54.120 --> 18:55.120
more than 100 percent.

18:55.120 --> 18:57.680
They just don't want to do it right?

18:57.680 --> 18:59.680
It's grueling work.

18:59.680 --> 19:05.600
If you do it long haul you basically have to go out and for a week of sleeping in motels

19:05.600 --> 19:08.640
in the back of your truck you don't see your family.

19:08.640 --> 19:15.720
It's both boring and scary at the same time and yeah it pays it pays okay than most other

19:15.720 --> 19:23.320
jobs of that skill level because it only takes a month or so to get the training but no.

19:23.320 --> 19:28.240
So when they start driving the trucks which they will they're not going to put anybody

19:28.240 --> 19:32.040
out of work at first they're going to just replace the truck driving jobs that are sitting

19:32.040 --> 19:34.320
open which is a lot of them.

19:34.320 --> 19:38.360
Eventually they might sit and go after some of those career truck drivers and I do feel

19:38.360 --> 19:42.700
yeah it would be good to have some alternatives for them find some outs and maybe the government

19:42.700 --> 19:45.120
can do that maybe the companies can even do it.

19:45.120 --> 19:51.240
But among all the jobs that people will find replaced by machines these ones this is not

19:51.240 --> 19:55.240
a great answer if you're in them but these ones are not the top of the list of ones that

19:55.240 --> 19:56.240
people will worry about.

19:56.240 --> 20:02.040
Yeah people also are very worried about the manufacturing jobs and that is being misused

20:02.040 --> 20:05.960
or used or whatever you want to call it for political purposes all across board.

20:05.960 --> 20:10.840
You know manufacturing jobs weren't taken by robots manufacturing jobs were taken by

20:10.840 --> 20:17.120
cheaper workers China oh not just yeah China other countries Philippines Southeast Asia

20:17.120 --> 20:21.880
is the place right now used to people who used to think Japan was the place with the

20:21.880 --> 20:27.840
cheap workers of course Japan very quickly didn't have cheap workers and you know people

20:27.840 --> 20:33.540
in India Pakistan you know they're anywhere that especially that is there they speak English

20:33.540 --> 20:39.760
so help them do jobs for the Western world.

20:39.760 --> 20:43.760
Anyway yes that's going to continue there's going to be labor disruption I don't think

20:43.760 --> 20:47.760
anyone can alter that but let me give you two ways of thinking about machines doing

20:47.760 --> 20:52.000
human tasks which is that many people have published studies and they say we calculate

20:52.000 --> 20:56.320
that machines are right they don't do it yet but they're right to do like a third of the

20:56.320 --> 21:00.880
tasks that human beings do and some people get that and they respond by saying oh my

21:00.880 --> 21:05.080
god the computer is going to take my job what am I going to do I must admit that I respond

21:05.080 --> 21:09.720
to a different way saying when can I get that fantastic I don't want to do all those stupid

21:09.720 --> 21:14.880
boring things I have to do the computer could do that for me and sign me up and it's really

21:14.880 --> 21:19.920
a mix of both for most people and what's actually happened in the past in all the jobs is that

21:19.920 --> 21:24.600
the computer has done some of the boring or dangerous parts of it and the human beings

21:24.600 --> 21:31.320
have done the rest and employment has not counting coronavirus panics employment has

21:31.320 --> 21:35.600
grown and was until recently higher than it ever been in history and it wasn't the credit

21:35.600 --> 21:40.320
of Donald Trump he likes to pretend it was it was the march of progress that's actually

21:40.320 --> 21:45.520
made more and more jobs a hundred years ago half of the population worked in agriculture

21:45.520 --> 21:50.840
farming and now about two or three percent of the population work in agriculture farming

21:50.840 --> 21:58.880
so all those jobs disappeared half the jobs in the world went away and now more people

21:58.880 --> 22:03.440
are working than ever right new jobs were created because of the technological revolution

22:03.440 --> 22:07.440
some brand new jobs are created but actually most of those people are working in jobs that

22:07.440 --> 22:11.880
existed in some form or another but they're doing them in different ways like bank teller

22:11.880 --> 22:16.560
bank tellers are not handing you cash anymore right they're doing other parts of the banking

22:16.560 --> 22:23.920
job so let me read you a question that one of our readers and previous guest fritz harrell

22:23.920 --> 22:29.160
from ontario you're from canada originally right i am from ontario indeed yeah yeah amazing

22:29.160 --> 22:35.040
i live there 11 years in toronto he's wondering about your take on the long-term consequences

22:35.040 --> 22:40.720
of separating humans from the actual activity they're doing given we are the outcome of

22:40.720 --> 22:47.000
a long evolutionary process and this technological concentric distancing from an activity we

22:47.000 --> 22:51.880
are actually responsible for might have unexpected unexpected outcomes and then he's using the

22:51.880 --> 22:58.200
airbuses fly by wire computer controlled flight that left pilots unable to fly boeing's computer

22:58.200 --> 23:04.160
assisted aircraft safely which he thinks were part of the mcas mishaps in addition to a

23:04.160 --> 23:08.600
poor design decisions he has another part to his question but maybe you answer this

23:08.600 --> 23:13.280
one first well yeah i don't want to be too critical but that question seemed to dance

23:13.280 --> 23:16.880
around a lot of different things so i'm not sure what specific thing he wants to get at

23:16.880 --> 23:23.400
but i'll talk about a little bit about the boeing aircraft i mean so um i mean it was

23:23.400 --> 23:27.680
airbus of course that pioneered the idea of making aircraft be fly by wire at the time

23:27.680 --> 23:32.280
that they were founded everyone said you're crazy we can't make an aircraft that way and

23:32.280 --> 23:35.920
they did and they were very successful and boeing was of course the company not that

23:35.920 --> 23:42.720
did not pioneer that and their decision with the 737 max was actually uh i i thought it

23:42.720 --> 23:47.160
very different from that they wanted to make another vehicle that they could say was the

23:47.160 --> 23:51.800
same the 737 one most popular aircraft in the world every airline has a lot of them

23:51.800 --> 23:56.240
every pilot in the world is trained to fly the 737 and what they hoped is they could

23:56.240 --> 24:02.560
make a 737 with bigger engines and more and newer more efficient engines and make it so

24:02.560 --> 24:07.440
that any pilot could fly who knew how to fly the 737 that was what they hoped to do and

24:07.440 --> 24:12.840
that's what they got wrong uh they they figured the way to do that since they built actually

24:12.840 --> 24:17.740
a different aircraft which wouldn't fly the same as 737 and they tried to make it fly

24:17.740 --> 24:22.440
as a 737 by using the software system which is not entirely a wrong thing to try to do

24:22.440 --> 24:27.580
but they just didn't do it very well and they there were some areas where they didn't test

24:27.580 --> 24:33.320
it properly and it it um you know it goofed up and then the pilots were not trained on

24:33.320 --> 24:38.720
how to deal with it because that was the whole point of the 737 max no not no new training

24:38.720 --> 24:43.400
but very little new training needed for a 737 pilot take the wings it turns out there

24:43.400 --> 24:47.680
should have been more training and so some pilots uh didn't understand what was going

24:47.680 --> 24:52.600
on by the way there were pilots who had that happen to them and they uh dealt with it because

24:52.600 --> 24:58.240
they were more experienced pilots and uh so anyway and of course catastrophic for bowing

24:58.240 --> 25:02.640
uh but uh i'm the rest of the question rambled a little bit so i wasn't entirely i think

25:02.640 --> 25:06.660
the soul of this question goes back to what you said how human drivers are still better

25:06.660 --> 25:13.360
than machines and he's talking about the unseen consequences of replacing let's say human

25:13.360 --> 25:18.720
drivers who have we have evolved decades learning how to drive a car and watching our parents

25:18.720 --> 25:23.480
drive a car and seeing other drivers and this whole thing being replaced by the machines

25:23.480 --> 25:29.760
basically well so um that is actually an answer we'll give in the other direction by some

25:29.760 --> 25:34.720
of the for example waymo the company that i worked for in its early days google um yeah

25:34.720 --> 25:39.960
it was google at the time uh they have now been out there driving and testing their software

25:39.960 --> 25:43.200
well i don't know what the most recent number they published but i think it was around 20

25:43.200 --> 25:50.880
million miles of real road driving um so that's about 40 human lifetimes of experience in

25:50.880 --> 25:54.840
the sense that when anything unusual happens so these cars are out there driving themselves

25:54.840 --> 25:59.800
but they have people in them the people are making note if anything weird goes on they

25:59.800 --> 26:04.240
take over if they think there's a chance the software is going to not do the right thing

26:04.240 --> 26:09.640
and so their safety record is excellent they've had only one very slow crash that took place

26:09.640 --> 26:14.360
where it was the fault of the computer uh and by the way so you never you know there's

26:14.360 --> 26:18.840
never been a case of human being driving for 40 lifetimes well no one drives for 40 lifetimes

26:18.840 --> 26:24.120
but um human beings are not nearly that good they could drive for 40 lifetimes and never

26:24.120 --> 26:28.600
and only once have fault for a crash um now that's with the supervision there it's more

26:28.600 --> 26:32.720
like student drivers with a driving instructor sitting next to them ready to grab the wheel

26:32.720 --> 26:38.160
and so that's one reason they don't have the accidents but anyway they've been doing that

26:38.160 --> 26:43.200
and so they think they have seen more than any person could ever see in addition by the

26:43.200 --> 26:46.960
way they uh then have the car drive around in simulator you know a little video game

26:46.960 --> 26:51.840
basically uh and they've driven billions and billions and billions of miles and either

26:51.840 --> 26:55.560
way and most of the miles none of the miles they drive in simulator are boring they don't

26:55.560 --> 27:00.160
have it simulate driving on the freeway for an hour which is what humans have for most

27:00.160 --> 27:05.080
of our experience it spends that hour going through a hundred different crash situations

27:05.080 --> 27:10.560
and 200 strange other situations testing and it's going to do the right thing so actually

27:10.560 --> 27:15.880
there's a fair claim that these systems are far more experienced at driving than we are

27:15.880 --> 27:20.680
what they don't have they have experience what they don't have is uh you know the high

27:20.680 --> 27:25.840
level human thought and intuition uh which can solve problems never seen before so the

27:25.840 --> 27:31.040
answer to that is they feel now people can argue whether this is true or not but if you

27:31.040 --> 27:35.720
just pound at it long enough and you drive for 20 million miles or some other amount

27:35.720 --> 27:40.440
like that and do all these tests you reduce the probability of something you've never

27:40.440 --> 27:45.040
seen before happening you get it down to the point where you're you are seeing new things

27:45.040 --> 27:49.480
but you're handling them correctly and if we don't handle one correctly then you get

27:49.480 --> 27:54.400
very upset and you try and fix it and you find yourself getting to a level where that

27:54.400 --> 27:57.600
bad incident where something new happens and you don't handle it correctly and there's

27:57.600 --> 28:04.840
a crash is so rare that you're better than people and if you get to that level um which

28:04.840 --> 28:09.840
Waymo claims they are already in at least in the simple driving environment near Phoenix

28:09.840 --> 28:13.840
where they have an operating passenger service where vehicles are running around not right

28:13.840 --> 28:18.840
now with the virus but generally we're out running around with nobody in them picking

28:18.840 --> 28:23.800
up passengers taking them across town so uh you can do that once you've got to that level

28:23.800 --> 28:27.000
and then you get even better and you release it out to the world.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.480
Waymo is the same company that they partnered with Walmart for driverless trucks?

28:31.480 --> 28:35.840
They do they do have a they do have I believe a small partnership with Walmart doing deliveries

28:35.840 --> 28:41.240
I think Walmart's done one or two partnerships um but the other yes they are also making

28:41.240 --> 28:43.320
trucks as well that's correct.

28:43.320 --> 28:48.440
Do you think laws and regulations are in a way obstacles in a way of technological progress

28:48.440 --> 28:54.360
I think I read somewhere that the first car when it came out in late 19th century it was

28:54.360 --> 28:59.120
15 years later that they placed a first stop sign.

28:59.120 --> 29:03.640
Well that would make sense I mean there were no roads for cars back when those first cars

29:03.640 --> 29:10.400
arose and there were no gas stations and there's the famous story actually of Berta Benz the

29:10.400 --> 29:17.640
wife of Carl Benz who of course built the first commercial motorwagen and Berta uh it's

29:17.640 --> 29:22.920
maybe exaggerated but the story is she kind of snuck off with it and drove for about 60

29:22.920 --> 29:29.280
miles to another German town and she had to stop at a drugstore which actually had a supply

29:29.280 --> 29:33.640
of benzene there were no stations of course for this and it was all back dirt roads and

29:33.640 --> 29:38.960
so on so she did the first road trip including having to fix the vehicle on the way so a

29:38.960 --> 29:46.640
pioneer in her own way and it's certainly was a long time it yeah it took a while for

29:46.640 --> 29:50.920
I don't know if it was the law I mean there were a few rare cases it's not as common as

29:50.920 --> 29:55.480
people imagine but there were a few cases of very strange laws from people scared of

29:55.480 --> 29:57.160
the car.

29:57.160 --> 30:02.080
The funny story is that when the car did arrive actually the first cars were electric but

30:02.080 --> 30:08.320
pretty quickly they switched to running on benzene gasoline that the first cars to or

30:08.320 --> 30:12.600
when cars start arriving in New York City everyone praised them as oh my god we're

30:12.600 --> 30:16.600
going to end pollution with these and the reason they said that was the roads were full

30:16.600 --> 30:21.240
of a different kind of pollution from the thing that we used before cars yeah no they

30:21.240 --> 30:27.760
were the roads were deep and harsh it was an actual big problem and yes these things

30:27.760 --> 30:31.960
made a few bad smells in the air but nothing compared to the horses and so people were

30:31.960 --> 30:34.080
very happy about that.

30:34.080 --> 30:38.460
This dynamic between regulations and technology today though because the way that you talk

30:38.460 --> 30:43.520
about it and I totally agree with it that automating driving maybe it is an ethical

30:43.520 --> 30:49.080
choice that it can be made an argument because of it that it will cause less accidents it's

30:49.080 --> 30:54.200
better eventually than human drivers but there will be lawmakers who are paid special in

30:54.200 --> 30:59.980
United States lobbied by car companies let's say or a variety of special interests and

30:59.980 --> 31:05.100
lobbyists who are placing obstacles on the way of this progress.

31:05.100 --> 31:11.840
To an extent actually though because the car companies at least until recently and still

31:11.840 --> 31:17.480
to a large extent they want to win this technology fight they they're trying to build these vehicles

31:17.480 --> 31:22.240
they're scared of the startups being more nimble than they are smarter than them but

31:22.240 --> 31:29.320
they won't admit that so they're mostly for it although it doesn't mean that they wouldn't

31:29.320 --> 31:32.740
mind if it went a little bit slower and if it was a little bit harder for new companies

31:32.740 --> 31:37.040
to get in the game and for big companies to continue to win but other than that what we

31:37.040 --> 31:42.560
you know the people we've got try to do this though are Google and Apple you know and Ford

31:42.560 --> 31:47.680
and General Motors frankly when those companies want something I think it'll happen I think

31:47.680 --> 31:53.280
that they have the lobbying much more lobbying power than anyone else.

31:53.280 --> 31:59.560
Now nonetheless there's certainly legal efforts to slow things down and as I've said I think

31:59.560 --> 32:06.160
it's already illegal to not drive safely on the roads and so that those laws and the truth

32:06.160 --> 32:12.480
is all the companies are very afraid not just of the legal consequences of them hitting

32:12.480 --> 32:17.080
something but we saw that Uber of course did completely screw up what they were doing they

32:17.080 --> 32:24.240
did run someone over and that shut down their project which a project they had named was

32:24.240 --> 32:29.920
central to the success of their company and it shut down and it's they have like a couple

32:29.920 --> 32:38.360
of test cars out now and this is years later now it's just two years later now everyone

32:38.360 --> 32:45.580
stopped because of the pandemic but you know everyone realizes that they're investing billions

32:45.580 --> 32:49.840
in this thing and if they make a mistake like that it could just wipe it all out and so

32:49.840 --> 32:53.440
they're very strongly motivated to not make such a mistake obviously in the case of Uber

32:53.440 --> 33:00.400
not strongly enough and that is a long story we can get into if you want but because I

33:00.400 --> 33:08.520
probably studied that more than anybody outside of Uber or the NTSB and you know and it was

33:08.520 --> 33:16.320
in the end it was it was a it was human error but human error caused by management decisions

33:16.320 --> 33:17.320
poor management decisions.

33:17.320 --> 33:18.320
This is Uber.

33:18.320 --> 33:24.280
Yeah the Uber fatality now I mean obviously the software in the Uber car was not good

33:24.280 --> 33:30.880
enough to drive the roads that's pretty clear but that's not a mistake in the sense that

33:30.880 --> 33:36.360
all of the cars when they're prototypes go out there unable to drive and I have been

33:36.360 --> 33:41.560
in the Google car when it you know started acting erratically and I had to take the wheel

33:41.560 --> 33:45.200
every single vehicle no matter what the quality of the team making it goes through periods

33:45.200 --> 33:50.360
where it's necessary for the human being inside of it to take the wheel and stop it from hitting

33:50.360 --> 33:56.880
something fortunately very rarely a person but in some cases there have been many incidents

33:56.880 --> 34:00.480
where you someone had to take the wheel to stop what might have been an accident that

34:00.480 --> 34:05.280
hurt somebody so that's normal that's that's part of the game and as I said they've gone

34:05.280 --> 34:10.600
for this 40 human lifetimes without hitting anybody so it works if you do it well but

34:10.600 --> 34:16.880
it doesn't guarantee that people will do it well who were hired obviously a very poor

34:16.880 --> 34:21.720
choice of person to supervise the vehicle to make it worse everybody uses two people

34:21.720 --> 34:25.440
to supervise the vehicle and they decided to go to just one for reasons that are still

34:25.440 --> 34:31.160
debated and the person they hired paid no attention to her job and started watching

34:31.160 --> 34:37.240
a streaming show on her phone and so yeah yeah if your job is to watch the road and

34:37.240 --> 34:42.520
you're watching a streaming show on your phone people can get hurt and that is that is tragic

34:42.520 --> 34:50.600
but it is sadly not too remarkable in terms of of telling us that though the robots are

34:50.600 --> 34:57.400
dangerous I mean I won't say there's no lessons to be learned for how to operate robots there

34:57.400 --> 35:02.000
are lessons to be learned that uber and other people did learn them but everyone also learned

35:02.000 --> 35:06.080
the lesson a lesson that they all knew which is you cannot play it fast and loose the way

35:06.080 --> 35:11.200
that uber did because it can mean the end of everything you're trying to do what you

35:11.200 --> 35:15.840
said what you said about google also reminded me of google glass that when it came out it

35:15.840 --> 35:19.720
was it was so cutting edge and we were all like this is what we want to get you know

35:19.720 --> 35:25.400
it's it's like a very obvious step towards becoming a cyborg but people started attacking

35:25.400 --> 35:31.200
a lot of people who were wearing google glasses around san francisco area that they filmed

35:31.200 --> 35:35.880
it whether it was because they were threatened because of privacy reasons or because they

35:35.880 --> 35:39.120
were threatened because hey you you think you're better than me or something like that

35:39.120 --> 35:43.640
and that kind of shut it down for I don't know I know that they're still around but

35:43.640 --> 35:48.920
not my doctor is always wearing one when I go to the doctor and he says he says I have

35:48.920 --> 35:53.820
to ask if it's okay to use this and I say well I helped build it so I'm probably okay

35:53.820 --> 36:00.880
with it now I helped in a very very tiny way I was working at google x on the car and glass

36:00.880 --> 36:04.580
was the second project of google x where I sat with those people and you know contributed

36:04.580 --> 36:11.680
very tiny amounts to what they did but so no I mean glass was just a product that was

36:11.680 --> 36:16.000
I mean both too early and aimed a little bit wrong as happens when you're too early and

36:16.000 --> 36:23.080
I don't think there's any giant lesson from that I mean there are lessons to be sure the

36:23.080 --> 36:31.000
lesson as I make in a humorous way is that glass was designed to be super lightweight

36:31.000 --> 36:35.600
they wanted it to be really light and small and especially for that day I mean I think

36:35.600 --> 36:39.760
there's people who've done even better years since but at the time it was a remarkable

36:39.760 --> 36:44.440
engineering achievement to make it so light and small and the goal in fact was to make

36:44.440 --> 36:48.440
it so light that you would forget you had it on which you could I mean I wore it from

36:48.440 --> 36:53.040
time to time and I would forget it was on there I let you know I'd even go to the bathroom

36:53.040 --> 36:59.280
with it on I'd realize now probably that's not a cool thing to do but the joke was that

36:59.280 --> 37:03.800
it nobody else forgot you had it on anyone who looked at you said oh he's got that super

37:03.800 --> 37:09.000
geeky thing on his head one of the design factors was it was asymmetrical it was only

37:09.000 --> 37:15.360
on one side of your head the human eye is very noticing of that so nobody knows and

37:15.360 --> 37:19.840
so people just weren't very accepting of it it couldn't do very much because it was limited

37:19.840 --> 37:23.320
by how much power it would take to do things it had to run on a very small battery that

37:23.320 --> 37:30.520
fit in the arm of an eyeglass or a little box behind your ear and I don't think we've

37:30.520 --> 37:35.200
actually figured out the exact answer for how we would want to wear a computer well

37:35.200 --> 37:39.160
I don't have it on right now but I guess so I have smart watch that I wear some of the

37:39.160 --> 37:43.800
time I actually think the watch is a better form factor for these sort of things the watch

37:43.800 --> 37:48.240
doesn't take video because it's not up in a place to do so you know I see you're wearing

37:48.240 --> 37:52.640
a kind of amulet I actually think that wouldn't be a bad form factor what have you got there

37:52.640 --> 37:59.600
it's a yeah these two have been brought for me by my girlfriend from Hawaii and the first

37:59.600 --> 38:04.440
you're wearing it is art yes but I'm all in favor of you know if there will be a contact

38:04.440 --> 38:11.240
lens or Elon Musk Neuralink by the time it's a third fourth generation that you can somehow

38:11.240 --> 38:15.580
rely on it that it's not gonna you know it's not the first generation I'm all in favor

38:15.580 --> 38:20.160
of it because I think this is actually not a new process that we are merging with the

38:20.160 --> 38:26.800
machines is just becoming seamless well so the goal with glass was not to merge with

38:26.800 --> 38:32.040
machines by any stretch what they wanted to see happened with glass and you know unfortunately

38:32.040 --> 38:36.080
wasn't as exciting as they wanted it to be but they wanted to see what happened with

38:36.080 --> 38:40.840
what if you know what if a computer or a computer or the network was just really super available

38:40.840 --> 38:45.040
with very little effort very little time I mean obviously everyone's already got a phone

38:45.040 --> 38:50.760
in their pocket so you'd think boy isn't computing very available to you and it is but reaching

38:50.760 --> 38:55.380
into your pocket pulling out a phone unlocking it finding the app you want to run running

38:55.380 --> 39:02.520
the app getting an answer that is comparatively a lot to just having something in front of

39:02.520 --> 39:09.540
your eyes that you can just look at and see so anyway so the answer was yeah it wasn't

39:09.540 --> 39:16.740
as exciting for people who need to work hands-free like the doctor there's people like that using

39:16.740 --> 39:22.280
devices like Google Glass today and it's reasonably successful with them but will it be in a watch

39:22.280 --> 39:28.240
will it be an appendent will it be in a well contact lens sure but we don't know how to

39:28.240 --> 39:33.600
make we don't have the technology yet to make a contact lens to do what we need to do there

39:33.600 --> 39:36.760
other than to also have glasses with it to send the power to it because there's no way

39:36.760 --> 39:43.400
to store power in a contact lens you got to transmit the power safely to it and and will

39:43.400 --> 39:47.320
it be an implant in the brain well again lots of experimentation going on there but very

39:47.320 --> 39:54.240
very primitive right now maybe someday will be less primitive including Neuralink you

39:54.240 --> 39:58.680
know Neuralink doesn't say a lot about what they're doing so I can't really you know comment

39:58.680 --> 40:06.560
on it only in a very speculative way but actually I'll tell you the one thing about about things

40:06.560 --> 40:12.000
like Neuralink which makes it such a hard problem is we've already got this massive

40:12.000 --> 40:17.680
channel into the brain right here and to beat the ability of this thing to get information

40:17.680 --> 40:23.960
into the brain I mean that that's not happening for a long time I mean the eye the eye and

40:23.960 --> 40:29.740
the ear of you know obviously evolved to be this but they're extremely high bandwidth

40:29.740 --> 40:35.200
information channels which we're very tuned to work with so you toss a chip in your brain

40:35.200 --> 40:40.280
with a thousand electrodes and yeah you might be able to do some cool stuff but you're nothing

40:40.280 --> 40:45.320
compared to the eye what are your thoughts on merging with machines in general you're

40:45.320 --> 40:52.200
involved in Singularity University Ray Kurzweil has the date 2045 for Singularity yeah I don't

40:52.200 --> 40:59.080
know I think you should never name dates that's a that's a bad thing and it well whatever

40:59.080 --> 41:04.440
of course people have many different definitions of what a Singularity is actually Verna Vinci

41:04.440 --> 41:10.440
who was the person who coined the term and who I've known for many years I published

41:10.440 --> 41:20.640
one of his books in e-book form back good lord almost 30 years ago he eventually said

41:20.640 --> 41:26.080
that the idea of a singularity was actually like a mathematical singularity a metaphor

41:26.080 --> 41:30.960
for it as a point that you can't it's undefined that you cannot predict beyond that it's you

41:30.960 --> 41:35.240
don't have the equipment to predict what it means so which means it's not kind of pointless

41:35.240 --> 41:41.120
to talk about what it means because you are not equipped to do it maybe future you will

41:41.120 --> 41:49.600
be equipped to do it and and then more specifically of course of computer intelligence becoming

41:49.600 --> 41:54.320
so smart that it surpasses humans and that among the things that surpasses humans that

41:54.320 --> 42:00.640
is programming new intelligence so that it is also better at making its own descendants

42:00.640 --> 42:04.960
and that this could then happen so quickly that you quickly leave the abilities of humans

42:04.960 --> 42:11.120
behind it's very hard to predict when that would happen or if that would happen but yes

42:11.120 --> 42:15.200
we're we are going to get closer and closer machines and I do believe it is obviously

42:15.200 --> 42:19.160
possible to have intelligence in a machine because if you can have it in a sort of a

42:19.160 --> 42:24.880
wet tank of proteins inside bone I'm pretty sure you could have it in other things I'm

42:24.880 --> 42:29.680
nothing magical about our brains some people trying to imagine all the brain has some mystical

42:29.680 --> 42:34.040
ability to hold intelligence well obviously religions believe that religions believe that

42:34.040 --> 42:39.280
there's something outside the brain a soul bestowed from God or whoever is the origin

42:39.280 --> 42:44.680
of those things but if you're not taking that approach then there's nothing magical about

42:44.680 --> 42:51.480
the brain and so clearly that's not the only way that intelligence could exist and so eventually

42:51.480 --> 42:56.040
we will make one I mean we make intelligences all the time any man and woman can do it with

42:56.040 --> 43:02.440
the things around they have around the house but we are not aware of how we do it it just

43:02.440 --> 43:08.760
evolved but it's obviously possible to do it when we will understand how to do it is

43:08.760 --> 43:13.640
a less answered question but we keep seeing glimpses that we're getting closer to that

43:13.640 --> 43:17.680
but I'm not going to go so far as to agree with Ray's prediction very interesting perspective

43:17.680 --> 43:24.840
I haven't I've never heard the bone and the like if we can create intelligence in with

43:24.840 --> 43:31.520
our structure we certainly can it can be done within machines that's that's a very interesting

43:31.520 --> 43:36.260
comparison but we do it right I mean yeah unless you believe in the mystical soul coming

43:36.260 --> 43:41.360
into the body it is entirely the act of humans which makes more humans and more intelligences

43:41.360 --> 43:45.880
well mystical soul is just an attempt to answer the unanswerable basically right our attempt

43:45.880 --> 43:50.640
that we know what's going on it's a lot of things it is for many people though a strong

43:50.640 --> 43:59.840
desire to feel that we are more than yeah some people some people feel that and then

43:59.840 --> 44:03.160
they sense that they look at the world and they say it has to be more than flesh and

44:03.160 --> 44:11.520
bone other people you know feel they've had a religious experience to tell them that and

44:11.520 --> 44:14.480
so there are many people who think that and there are other people and I'm one of them

44:14.480 --> 44:19.240
who look at it and say actually I think it's freaking amazing that you can have intelligence

44:19.240 --> 44:24.080
from just that's it's not you know God is wondrous and amazing I'm saying it's wondrous

44:24.080 --> 44:31.160
and amazing that evolution could produce something like us and Einstein who though he was a religious

44:31.160 --> 44:37.320
man said a great thing he said the most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible

44:37.320 --> 44:45.720
that that the remarkable thing is that something as amazing as the universe and of course it's

44:45.720 --> 44:50.680
amazing and many people say that's proof of God is that the universe is so amazing but

44:50.680 --> 44:55.240
the fact that the workings of the universe can at some level be understood inside the

44:55.240 --> 44:59.880
brain of a piece of the universe that's what Einstein was marveling at and I marvel at

44:59.880 --> 45:06.640
it with him yeah I totally agree the God term I've talked about a number of people mathematicians

45:06.640 --> 45:11.760
philosopher technologists it means nothing when people are saying it they don't even

45:11.760 --> 45:17.040
know what it means they just throw it out there to basically fill a gap of the unknown

45:17.040 --> 45:20.800
I'm not gonna go that hard I mean there are people who devote their lives to it my father

45:20.800 --> 45:26.520
before I was born devoted his life to it he became an agnostic but the Christian version

45:26.520 --> 45:34.280
of a God the Christian version he was he was of Christian but there are people from all

45:34.280 --> 45:40.800
kinds of faiths who all and many people who devoted themselves now there is a cynical

45:40.800 --> 45:45.520
but very rational explanation for it that the brain does seem to be a little bit primed

45:45.520 --> 45:50.320
to feel a spiritual connection and they've found for example there's areas in the brain

45:50.320 --> 45:56.640
that you can stimulate that cause people to have a religious experience so that they actually

45:56.640 --> 46:01.200
feel they've got direct contact with something spiritual and having directly experienced

46:01.200 --> 46:07.040
that then they it is not surprising that they believe it you think machines could have a

46:07.040 --> 46:14.120
similar kind of an experience yes I mean I don't think they'd have a part of the machine

46:14.120 --> 46:21.040
that you can stick electrodes in and it starts seeing God humans seem to have that some would

46:21.040 --> 46:27.360
argue ah God put that there well there should be a need for it right well I believe that

46:27.360 --> 46:33.360
we are machines and in the full formal definition of a machine obviously we're not gears in

46:33.360 --> 46:39.400
oil and so of course machines can have spiritual experiences because we are machines and we

46:39.400 --> 46:48.200
have them and machines that think as we do or think better than we do of course should

46:48.200 --> 46:55.960
be able to understand what spiritual means and now would they actually have the spiritual

46:55.960 --> 47:01.160
experience that comes to us because of what some might call a flaw in our brains they

47:01.160 --> 47:05.840
could be designed to I'm not sure I would design one that way but someone else might

47:05.840 --> 47:12.760
fair enough but would they be able to understand the things that we talk about when we talk

47:12.760 --> 47:18.160
about spirituality I would have to believe so if they are as smart as we are yeah let

47:18.160 --> 47:24.200
me just mention this when I said about God and people I don't mean to offend anybody

47:24.200 --> 47:30.680
I you know I I guess can be considered a spiritual person in my own way but my argument was that

47:30.680 --> 47:36.440
objectively speaking it's impossible to come up with kind of a definition that you would

47:36.440 --> 47:41.200
have everybody agreed upon because a Muslim God is a very different than a Christian God

47:41.200 --> 47:46.940
than a you know whatever higher being that Hindus believe in for example and majority

47:46.940 --> 47:52.240
of people in the world they don't believe in any specific version of a God well let

47:52.240 --> 47:56.240
me go more specific than this though I will tell you that I'm one of the people who believes

47:56.240 --> 48:01.360
that it is not out of the question that the first machine intelligences would be copied

48:01.360 --> 48:05.760
from human brains and this has become something the public's a little more aware of because

48:05.760 --> 48:12.040
Amazon recently released a TV series called upload where that's essential plot element

48:12.040 --> 48:17.440
this concept has been around in fiction and in speculation for many decades and the idea

48:17.440 --> 48:23.200
is that while we do not understand how intelligence works or how the brain works it's not impossible

48:23.200 --> 48:30.120
that first we'll understand how it works at the low level and simply copy the pattern

48:30.120 --> 48:34.480
that we don't understand but we can copy some people argue whether we can copy it or

48:34.480 --> 48:40.240
not but let's people here are positing that you could copy it into a non-bag of protein

48:40.240 --> 48:44.240
form into a wouldn't necessarily it wouldn't be a digital computer but it would be some

48:44.240 --> 48:50.400
kind of electronic form for example and that you would have then that human mind inside

48:50.400 --> 48:59.360
the silicon and that would be both an artificial brain and a natural intelligence in the and

48:59.360 --> 49:05.360
of course as a copy of you or I or anyone else it could certainly believe in God and

49:05.360 --> 49:10.440
talk to you about God all day exactly the same way the human that this he or she was

49:10.440 --> 49:16.520
copied from could let me read you the second part of the question that I read that how

49:16.520 --> 49:22.320
will the insurance business appropriate fault in a computer controlled car would it be the

49:22.320 --> 49:28.560
driver the car market and carmaker the software engineer who would it be funny because I just

49:28.560 --> 49:33.500
literally a few minutes ago came from a planning session for a debate that we'll be having

49:33.500 --> 49:38.440
online tomorrow on insurance and self-driving cars and I've actually spoken about that a

49:38.440 --> 49:45.520
lot where would that debate be it'll be of course virtual like what what website or it'll

49:45.520 --> 49:49.960
be this website called zoom-tank.com I'm not actually in this particular bait I'm usually

49:49.960 --> 49:56.640
in it but I'm in the planning committee and so the the answer is bad for the insurance

49:56.640 --> 50:01.760
companies which is that I don't think they actually have a role here now he's your friend

50:01.760 --> 50:05.960
is asking a question which a lot of people ask they just want to know who's at fault

50:05.960 --> 50:10.960
and the answer that's always been very obvious which is to say that first of all the computer

50:10.960 --> 50:15.040
makes a complete recording of anything that happened in three dimensions a recording far

50:15.040 --> 50:19.640
beyond any recording you've ever seen so in terms of who broke the law and who was at

50:19.640 --> 50:25.200
fault under the vehicle codes and so on that will be known within seconds you know look

50:25.200 --> 50:29.160
at the recording you'll say okay this guy did that that guy did that so in terms of

50:29.160 --> 50:36.760
legal fault that will be super simple and trivial and so if the software made a mistake

50:36.760 --> 50:41.440
the people who made or run the software will obviously be liable for it and no one's ever

50:41.440 --> 50:46.280
doubted that in fact so much of people never doubted that that most of the major companies

50:46.280 --> 50:50.960
including Google Volvo Mercedes all the big the big car companies not all of them but

50:50.960 --> 50:56.160
most of them have declared in advance of course we will be responsible if our car crashes

50:56.160 --> 51:00.920
and it's the fault of the car software we're not responsible if you run into it but you

51:00.920 --> 51:05.480
know if if it runs into something they're faulting how could it be any other way would

51:05.480 --> 51:09.600
you get into an uber if you had to sign a thing saying if this uber driver crashes I

51:09.600 --> 51:13.760
have to pay of course not you're not going to get into that car so of course they have

51:13.760 --> 51:19.000
to accept the responsibility for it so that a lot of people think like I hear that question

51:19.000 --> 51:23.360
a lot and it surprises me because to me and I think too many of the people the answer

51:23.360 --> 51:32.400
has been very straightforward are you familiar with defense distributed oh you mean Cody

51:32.400 --> 51:41.840
Wilson yes I met him interesting character how do you see this law lawsuit and the whole

51:41.840 --> 51:47.360
being able to print guns from the perspective of free speech and civil rights especially

51:47.360 --> 51:54.720
since you basically were at the top of electronic what is that the electronic frontier foundation

51:54.720 --> 52:00.400
yes we did a lawsuit over many years to get the courts to declare as they did that software

52:00.400 --> 52:06.240
is a form of expression and therefore protected by laws of free speech and so yeah the same

52:06.240 --> 52:09.840
applies to his files I would have to say even though they're even scarier I guess to people

52:09.840 --> 52:15.960
because he can make parts for guns or you can make parts for guns or the 3d printer

52:15.960 --> 52:21.880
so I'm not surprised it scares people I'm not surprised people are going after him but

52:21.880 --> 52:25.460
if you wanted to imagine a world where there are illegal files with things that must not

52:25.460 --> 52:30.240
be known that's a pretty scary world yeah it is speech though right

52:30.240 --> 52:35.400
it is it is yeah I mean and then I think we got the court so I shouldn't say yeah obviously

52:35.400 --> 52:39.720
because not yeah obviously because we did have to fight get a court to rule on that

52:39.720 --> 52:46.120
and have an eight-year fight but to us of course the case was pretty clear yeah I thought

52:46.120 --> 52:50.120
the genius of him was just blurring the line between the second amendment and the first

52:50.120 --> 52:54.880
amendment in such a meaningful way I read his book too it's not like he's right or

52:54.880 --> 53:01.120
left and I think this is beyond any kind of a political affiliation well you know as a

53:01.120 --> 53:05.000
Canadian you're probably not as much of a fan of the second amendment as most Americans

53:05.000 --> 53:10.260
are I'm a huge fan of second amendment because I'm coming from revolutionary Iran and I know

53:10.260 --> 53:14.800
that they distributed guns among the revolutionaries to take over the government and the first

53:14.800 --> 53:19.160
thing they did after the revolution succeeded it's like okay we're recalling all the guns

53:19.160 --> 53:24.840
the state has a monopoly on violence yeah no no I mean if you're in a obviously a dire

53:24.840 --> 53:29.920
situation as was the case in Iran but either during the Shah or later during the revolutionary

53:29.920 --> 53:37.600
government it's there's a reason why you want the public to defend themselves and in Canada

53:37.600 --> 53:42.720
actually of course there's a huge ownership of rifles among the population people think

53:42.720 --> 53:47.960
Canadians don't have guns no no we have lots of rifles what we don't have is handguns and

53:47.960 --> 53:54.480
it is clear that handguns are responsible for a significant increase in gun deaths in

53:54.480 --> 53:58.840
the United States I mean the numbers are just staggering so anyway but whether you're a

53:58.840 --> 54:02.960
fan of the second amendment or not people come to the defense of Cody Wilson because

54:02.960 --> 54:07.960
strictly for the first amendment question yeah all right let me this was a pleasure

54:07.960 --> 54:12.880
thank you so much for your time let me ask you the last question I ask all my guests

54:12.880 --> 54:16.840
that if you come across an intelligent alien from a different civilization what would you

54:16.840 --> 54:24.320
say is the worst thing humanity has done and what would you say is our greatest achievement

54:24.320 --> 54:31.040
well of course the intelligent alien already knows this in any real situation because any

54:31.040 --> 54:34.600
intelligent alien we're going to come across has got significantly greater capabilities

54:34.600 --> 54:45.320
than we have what is the worst and best thing that humans have done I mean I guess my answer

54:45.320 --> 54:49.960
on the worst thing is kind of boring right it's it's atrocity it's the long history

54:49.960 --> 54:57.520
of atrocity that we have it's the long history of you know like what happened you know we

54:57.520 --> 55:03.520
we study forever what happened in Germany in various other cases but to many ways you

55:03.520 --> 55:08.280
look at Rwanda where which happened in the modern world where we know the example of

55:08.280 --> 55:12.400
Germany and where you look at the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia where again we knew that example

55:12.400 --> 55:17.600
and it was modern times and it didn't take very much to pull away the veil and people

55:17.600 --> 55:25.680
would come out with their machetes right in Rwanda so the fact that and the fact that

55:25.680 --> 55:32.240
by the way Germans aren't really worse than us right we imagine okay oh yeah well they

55:32.240 --> 55:36.800
know the Germans were just they were all internal Nazis and so they did these horrible things

55:36.800 --> 55:40.800
no they were people not too different from the people today yeah people think it can

55:40.800 --> 55:46.560
be replicated here and repeated here in the US so yeah that's that that is still true

55:46.560 --> 55:55.680
as I would say is one of the things I think is the worst of us the best of us is what

55:55.680 --> 56:03.360
Einstein said that we have managed to actually get closer and closer to an understanding

56:03.360 --> 56:09.720
of the way the universe works that we're a piece of the universe and we keep doing that

56:09.720 --> 56:15.280
and we came up with science we came up with a way to actually make reliable information

56:15.280 --> 56:19.280
that we could test and repeat and test and repeat until it actually seemed like we had

56:19.280 --> 56:24.840
confidence it was true and that all of us know is true because we bet our lives on the

56:24.840 --> 56:29.040
truth of scientific principles every day everywhere we go and except when we're staying at home

56:29.040 --> 56:32.680
all day that's now we don't bet our lives on science every day well we still bet on

56:32.680 --> 56:39.760
the the food we eat is assured through these principles that we've devised so that grand

56:39.760 --> 57:06.640
achievement is the best bet.
