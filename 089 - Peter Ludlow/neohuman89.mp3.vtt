WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:22.040
You know a few years ago you would have thought it crazy to say well there aren't going to be any more like record stores or there aren't going to be any more books you know book Barnes and Noble bookstores or something like that or you know if you remember the day when we had travel agents and we had to go somewhere you went to visit the travel agent.

00:22.840 --> 00:28.060
No one does that anymore they do all that online now all that was done with centralized.

00:28.060 --> 00:35.580
Centralized computing platforms are placed in it and now we're doing it with a decentralized platform but.

00:36.180 --> 00:48.000
What we're going to see is that the the unraveling that we saw with things like the music industry the publishing industry.

00:48.000 --> 01:07.100
The newspaper industry for example all of these things had to radically change because of the internet well now we have another iteration of the internet and it's coming directly at traditional finance and things are going to move very very very rapidly.

01:07.100 --> 01:19.980
Peter lot low welcome back to near human podcast after a few episodes.

01:20.700 --> 01:26.300
Yeah yeah it's an honor to be back yeah I haven't done much because I honestly.

01:26.300 --> 01:44.080
I'm getting away from a routine of any kind and if there is something interesting or someone interesting pops up I'm more than happy and willing to talk but there is no need to do like one one a week or anything like that because I think anything that needed to be said has been said already you know this is the age of experiencing.

01:44.080 --> 01:57.400
Yeah yeah yeah I hear you I hear you so for those of our audience who are not familiar with what you're doing just a very quick introduction to who peter lot low is according to peter lot low.

01:57.400 --> 02:26.920
Well the last time I talked to you I started out by talking about my formative years as a grad student in New York and if you recall I talked about how I had become impressed by this group of people downtown that were the filmmakers and the no wave musicians and the musicians became filmmakers and the filmmakers became musicians the weirdos what's that the weirdos yeah yeah.

02:27.600 --> 02:28.380
I'm.

02:29.520 --> 02:38.580
And then I said something about how that I that sort of got me going on on this sort of intersection of linguistics and philosophy.

02:40.080 --> 02:52.640
And and so that drives a lot of what I do which is work on things that I don't know anything about but I'm always sort of for some reason attracted to these areas where there are people coming from.

02:52.640 --> 03:06.140
Completely different fields and it occurred to me after we talked about that that that's exactly what's going on in this decentralized finance space or this defy space which is that you have this.

03:06.140 --> 03:23.820
Bunch of people sort of coming in from different areas so you have the tech people coming in you have the finance people coming in and you have these legal people coming in to so it's making for an interesting mix and I'm glad you wanted to talk about these recent developments.

03:23.820 --> 03:53.760
Yeah we stayed in touch since the last time you were on mainly about John McAfee I think yeah sharing articles and stuff but then we also talked about defy and then the whole GameStop thing happen that for most of most people it just goes right above their head they don't even want to know about it exactly because of that because they don't want to say that they we don't know what's going on but it's such an interesting thing to talk about.

03:53.820 --> 04:09.080
A revolutionary thing that is happening especially considering how I have the US national debt clock right in front of me which is over 27 trillion 27.8 trillion soon to be 28 trillion and I think.

04:09.080 --> 04:30.840
This is a very important and interesting time considering socio-political dynamic in the US as well to talk about how this facade and illusion of stability that system tried to create so hard and at any cost can be brought down by members of a forum that.

04:30.840 --> 04:41.820
I believe the last article that I share with you was how the Goldman Sachs and interactive brokers executives are claiming that Wall Street bets tend a trend that could take down the system.

04:42.860 --> 04:44.500
Yeah so what's going on Peter.

04:44.500 --> 05:06.060
It absolutely could but it's I mean the thing is that there is you put it correctly there's this illusion of stability but everything is very very fragile and all it really takes is one black swan event to bring everything down you know we talked about Raul Paul who is a former hedge fund guy I guess he's still a hedge fund guy.

05:06.060 --> 05:32.160
That is a Mac so called macro investor and he published an emergency podcast about this right that that he thought that that GameStop business was going to trigger a meltdown so like on a on a weekend he's he was right he was like ready to see everything fall apart like on Monday of this this this current week before we.

05:32.160 --> 05:41.740
Go further would you describe it for people who don't know what's going on with respect to GameStop that what happened and what does that imply.

05:42.700 --> 05:57.860
Yeah so there were these hedge funds that were short selling GameStop what does that mean it means they were borrowing the stock and then selling it so it's not stock that they actually own but they borrow it to sell it.

05:57.860 --> 06:17.580
Why are they doing that they're doing that because they believe that GameStop is in a tenuous economic position why isn't it a tenuous economic position well because no one goes to brick and mortar stores anymore and also because you can download games you don't have to go to these stores.

06:17.580 --> 06:47.520
However in reddit there is a group called Wall Street that's and the people in Wall Street that's apparently felt nostalgic about GameStop and a few other things so among the things being shorted was not just GameStop but AMC the movie theater chain et cetera and they decided that the people in Wall Street that this reddit group decided that they were going to fight back and they were going to fight back.

06:47.580 --> 07:13.020
They were going to buy these stocks in the face of this this shorting this this shorting by the hedge funds and what happened one has a certain deadline to fulfill the contract that they're obligated to fulfill yeah yeah yeah yeah and then you know they're paying interest so you know it's it's a dangerous thing to short a stock because.

07:13.020 --> 07:41.800
Your exposure is kind of potentially infinite because as long as the price of the stock keeps going up you have to steep keep covering your covering your position and so the redditors were buying up they were buying up AMC they were buying up GameStop and the hedge funds got their basically they got their faces melted off.

07:41.800 --> 08:11.720
And so they were buying this stuff using Robin Hood and then Robin Hood came to the defense of the of the hedge funds and stop people from buying anymore stock so they allowed people to sell these stocks like GameStop but not to buy them with predictable results that the price cratered at that point and then a lot of a lot of users a lot of the clients of a lot of the clients of Robin Hood got burned.

08:11.800 --> 08:12.740
It also revealed a certain truth which is that you know they weren't really the clients of Robin Hood you know they might have thought they were but the thing is they weren't paying to do any of those transactions and the first rule of social media and the internet these days is that if you're not paying for the product who's the product you're the product you're the product exactly so the deal is that those people that were using Robin Hood they learned the hard way that the

08:41.800 --> 09:10.440
that they were the product and what was happening is that Robin Hood was selling selling data to hedge funds like Citadel and as my understanding is that they were not just selling it but they were selling it real time so that hedge funds could front run these trades so that is if I place a trade in in on or a bunch of my friends place a trade.

09:10.440 --> 09:40.360
On Robin Hood that data is seen immediately and it's handed to the hedge funds that are into high speed trading so they can buy it and then dump on us right it's it's somewhat gross but it is what it is and so that was the deal with the Wall Street bets and you know Raul Paul and some other people in finance sort of big time finance people thought that this could actually be the trigger that could bring down the whole house of cards.

09:40.880 --> 10:03.600
Because it could have generated a cascading effect you know if if that hedge fund starts to go over under then it has to start covering its positions it's got to start selling and then the worry was that it would initiate a cascading effect of of cells that would blow out other positions that are either long and short.

10:03.600 --> 10:31.080
And that would yield to more selling and then you know eventually we're down to like you know trading with fish hooks and ammunition or crypto crypto that was that was that you get the fish hooks ammunition canned goods and crypto Robin Hood I think I think it was Robin Hood that they also limited the buying ability of Dogecoin.

10:31.080 --> 10:55.200
Yeah yeah that was another one yeah which you know first of all the shorting of stock Elon Musk tweeted that you cannot sell the house you don't own you cannot sell the car you don't own but you can't sell the stock that you don't own but that is not to benefit you as the people that is to benefit very small group of I mean that is the definition of elites basically.

10:55.200 --> 11:25.200
Yeah there are there have been people complaining about short naked short selling you know shorting something that you don't actually hold and I mean it's another thing if you own it and you want to short it because then you're protecting your position and I think no one is objecting to short selling they're objecting to this idea that you borrow the stock to short it and then the really weird thing was that in this GameStop case I mean it turns out that you're not going to be able to sell the house you're

11:25.200 --> 11:34.700
there was more stock sold than actually existed so it was like the amount of shorted GameStop was like one point five three

11:34.900 --> 11:48.120
times the amount of GameStop that actually exists and if you think about it that it's like if that can happen then you're just in a hopeless situation because people can sell more stock than actually exists that's just gonna

11:48.120 --> 12:02.160
that's just gonna drive you to ruin and that is that is the complaint that a number of these people have i mean another person who famously complain about this is patrick bern used to run.

12:02.540 --> 12:14.060
Well guess he's still principal owner overstock.com i mean for years he was complaining about people naked short selling on his company.

12:14.060 --> 12:43.620
Yeah it's really interesting I think what's being disrupted at the core of all of these things is the concept of trust the trust in a middle man that a lot of people really you know you're born into it that you trust something outside of yourself it can be family it can be culture it can be education that you receive at school and you know how you receive that information is interpreted based on the intention of biases of people

12:43.620 --> 13:04.460
or the structure that you're a part of or consider you to be a part of it you know I use the example of religion in certain cases like an Islam you born into it and there's no way out of it and you're assumed as a member of that religion doesn't matter if you believe that's a justifiable kind of a thing to do or not so it seems like.

13:04.460 --> 13:12.680
Yes the house of cards is falling apart but that cannot necessarily be a bad thing if this whole thing has been an illusion.

13:14.500 --> 13:24.800
It will be I mean I don't know if it's gonna be a good thing or a bad thing it will be a different thing I mean you know the Chinese.

13:24.800 --> 13:43.760
I mean you know the Chinese it's not a problem but it's what is it may you lend it's an insult may you live an interesting time we certainly are the house of cards collapses we will be living in interesting times that's for sure and maybe something better emerges from it or.

13:43.760 --> 14:00.600
You know it's it's always dangerous because you don't know what you're going to see next I mean sometimes in these periods of instability something pretty terrible can emerge from it like happen in the first half of the twentieth century and we had.

14:00.960 --> 14:10.800
Lots of totalitarian movements emerge from these periods of crisis and so while the current system is untenable.

14:10.800 --> 14:23.320
And it looks like it's quite fragile and could come tumbling down at any minute I don't think anybody knows what what we're going to get next yeah.

14:23.320 --> 14:39.800
Yeah it's the reason I'm saying it's not necessarily a bad thing I don't mean that it's a good thing it's just something that is going beyond dependence on any centralized kind of a structure of authority or trust.

14:40.640 --> 14:51.040
Yeah see that's a good point and I like the trust point because the thing the thing is we we not only trusted these.

14:51.040 --> 15:14.520
So called middlemen but we had to we really didn't have a choice because these we need agents of trust in order for me to send money from me to you for us to engage in any sort of contract and what's happening with these with crypto currencies and decentralized finance is that.

15:14.520 --> 15:37.840
These middlemen are being eliminated by trustless contracts right basically by mathematics and computational systems and so forth so we didn't have a choice before we had to trust these people and they didn't really do anything to deserve our trust certainly banks did nothing to earn our trust and.

15:37.840 --> 15:57.560
And now that we have alternatives emerging very rapidly we may get a very different picture and we may find that those those institutions may be expecting us to continue with our trust but they're going to be disappointed if that's the expectation yeah.

15:57.560 --> 16:26.640
One way to maybe see some kind of a silver lining is that because we are going through this period of disruption then the solution which, in this case can be decentralization will be speed up basically increase in adoption because people will begin looking for alternatives and I think it's a very good argument that crypto currencies haven't really addressed in the last few years.

16:27.880 --> 16:45.280
The ease that regular customer need to do their things like with banking apps it's easy you know and it even that it took regular people many many years to go from going to the actual brick and mortar kind of a bank to use the app and a lot of people made the argument that going from that to.

16:45.280 --> 17:13.480
Let's say trading or buying or selling cryptocurrency at this point is not that tangible and it's not that feasible for majority of people but I think that will change exactly because of this because you've seen that the value of the money that you count on if it's a US dollar or Canadian dollar or whatever it's going down Bitcoin is going up for example and then you wonder why is this happening and when you understand the philosophy behind it at least.

17:13.480 --> 17:19.760
At least as much as you need to make sense out of what is happening then the adoption can happen right.

17:20.680 --> 17:36.640
Yeah I think so I think certainly on the room for both the ins for both institutions and retail there is a big kind of learning curve here and people are developing apps that are going to make this easier to do.

17:36.640 --> 18:05.760
But those apps are meaningless unless we have something there waiting for us once we get on board and I think what's really interesting actually since we last talked is is the kind of explosion of work that's being done in defy in in in creating alternatives to banking so you know if you want to get a loan I mean it is it's really an ugly process if you want to go to the bank and borrow some money you know they want to know who you are they want to know your entire history.

18:06.800 --> 18:23.160
They're going to charge you exorbitant rates likewise if you put a little bit of money into the bank they're they're not you know they're going to give you an interest rate of like what is it now point zero six percent or something like that but if you go into defy right now and if you put in money.

18:23.160 --> 18:44.280
I mean they're paying like ten percent fifteen percent I mean it varies a lot but I mean it's it's a real return on the money and more than that you could easily borrow money so here's an easy way to do it in some of these platforms you just put in some collateral in bitcoin or whatever and they say okay.

18:44.280 --> 19:14.280
I will loan you twenty percent of that money boom you make it with the contract you do it in ten seconds you don't have to go talk to a bank officer you don't have to like go through all the humiliation of applying for it you've got your bitcoin or you've got your aetherium or you've got your xrp whatever you have you go in you deposit it in the contract you take your money which will be like a US dollar stable coin let's say like a tethered US dollar stable coin let's say like a tethered US dollar stable

19:14.280 --> 19:44.260
dollar and take it take it out by a car you know it's that easy and so once people start wrapping their minds around this they go like why was I messing around going to a bank and and you know sitting in the waiting for bankers hours you have to wait for the you know the banker to be there sit in the little stuffy little bank and then talk in this sort of humiliating setting and so forth no I'm just going to log on I can do it I can read twenty seconds right now I can do it I can deposit.

19:44.280 --> 20:14.260
Bitcoin I can take out some some US dollar stable coins and boom I can go out and buy a car that's it it's that simple and so I as far as I can tell the entire US sort of worldwide financial banking system is going to be gone very rapidly or it's going to it's going to have to adopt to this and take it on very very quickly so it might I know it sounds crazy to say that.

20:14.280 --> 20:44.280
But you know a few years ago you would have thought it crazy to say well there aren't going to be any more like record stores or there aren't going to be any more books you know book Barnes and Noble book stores or something like that or you know if you remember the day when we had travel agents and we had to go somewhere you went to visit the travel agent no one does that anymore they do all that online now all that was done with centralized centralized computing

20:44.280 --> 21:12.280
platforms replacing it and now we're doing it with a decentralized platform but but what we're going to see is that the unraveling that we saw with things like the music industry the publishing industry the newspaper industry for example all of these things had to radically change because of the internet well now we have another

21:12.280 --> 21:35.280
iteration of the internet and it's coming directly at traditional finance and things are going to move very very very rapidly yeah I talked about you know the app parlor that came out as an alternative to Twitter and all that I keep telling people that it was not an alternative because

21:35.280 --> 22:04.280
centralization cannot be an alternate alternative for centralization and as we saw it they brought the whole thing down within hours and people are like oh they colluded all right they did it what are you going to do about it there's nothing you can do about it yeah so what we'll get well this is the other development now which is you know for whatever reason people are well for many reasons people are upset at big tech and a lot of people

22:04.280 --> 22:31.280
Trump supporters in particular lately have been upset about this what they perceive to be the censorious nature of of Twitter and Facebook etc and you know this will generate a kind of move to these decentralized social media platforms it's no good to have something like parlor was just you know one centralized

22:31.280 --> 22:54.280
you know one guy running the show and everything is sitting there on a Amazon cloud server or something like that I mean it's like this there's like one point of failure there so what we're going to see are these social media applications emerging on the blockchain there are a couple of them now

22:54.280 --> 23:17.280
there's one called voice which is built on the EOS blockchain but no one really uses EOS so no one really knows about it so they're not here yet or if they're here they're just tiny at this point hidden away but probably in the next few years we're going to start seeing the social media

23:17.280 --> 23:36.280
alternatives to centralized social media platforms and these are going to be housed online in in on the blockchain so they're going to be more censorship resistant when this happens so there's a lot going on it's not just in finance but probably

23:36.280 --> 23:53.280
the blockchain technology is coming for big tech and social centralized social media as well yeah I think it goes back to the concept of trust somebody was talking about how this time is similar to when Martin Luther

23:53.280 --> 24:06.280
translated Bible for the first time and allowed you know ordinary Christians to be able to read the Bible by themselves again going beyond that point of trust and authority that a lot of people would say that he was placed there

24:06.280 --> 24:15.280
as a matter of monopolizing on that power on that divine power otherwise Jesus's message had nothing to do with you have to follow this priest

24:15.280 --> 24:29.280
and even his resurrection had nothing to do with physical resurrection but all of this was twisted in order for you as a follower to depend on this middleman for hundreds of years until you could really make sense out of the message by yourself

24:29.280 --> 24:51.280
yes that is true a lot of the trust relationships of trust that we're in are simply because we don't have a choice now the worry about this is going to be well look we're going to end up being we're going to end up trusting somebody here

24:51.280 --> 25:09.280
and the people we end up trusting are probably going to be computer programmers you know so someone is writing so someone is going to be writing the code for whatever this alternative to facebook or parlor ends up being and someone is going to be

25:09.280 --> 25:13.280
writing the code for the new banking system

25:13.280 --> 25:21.280
that is going to replace JP Morgan Chase etc.

25:21.280 --> 25:28.280
Now it's true that everything is going to be there and we can all look at it's there on the blockchain

25:28.280 --> 25:33.280
written in solidity code the solidity programming language

25:33.280 --> 25:50.280
but are you fluent in solidity and life and solidity no i mean i guess we could learn it but for a lot of people like us we're going to need to trust somebody to tell us that yes this is code is doing what it's supposed to do

25:50.280 --> 26:05.280
so you know i wrote a paper about this sometime ago in the early days of aetherium and and the thought was that the system this new system is done i actually eliminate trust they're not exactly trustless

26:05.280 --> 26:19.280
but they reposition trust they're moving it somewhere else hopefully in a better direction but it's important to sort of always be alert to the fact that

26:19.280 --> 26:26.280
you have a new boss as it were and someone if not a boss at least someone in whom you have to place your trust

26:26.280 --> 26:40.280
and the people that you have to trust now are for at least the time being are these devs and whatever auditing firms are auditing these these online contracts and telling you that they're trustworthy

26:40.280 --> 26:56.280
yeah i think big picture of that is about artificial intelligence that at some point we have such level and scale of digitization that understanding it and making sense out of it would go beyond human capability

26:56.280 --> 27:12.280
i had a guest she's working on emotional intelligence for artificial intelligence and she was telling me about how their system in their driverless cars or right now when drivers are driving

27:12.280 --> 27:30.280
they identify 50 plus different emotions and information based on facial expression that to most people it's not even it's invisible it just slightest kind of movement then my question was that who's making sense out of 50 plus expression per second

27:30.280 --> 27:47.280
machine has to make sense out of that and then the machine context of good and bad right and wrong is not defined right so i think it goes beyond programmers and it gets to what they're called now ai ethicists

27:47.280 --> 28:06.280
that in google there is a civil war going on about their ai department because there are ai ethicists who are coming from certain kind of a worldview very activist political minded and at the same time it makes me wonder

28:06.280 --> 28:22.280
whether or not that would be a disservice to the progress of ai and it really is there's no i don't think there is any answer that are we going to allow artificial intelligence to roam freely and learn based on whatever and we just merge with it or are we

28:22.280 --> 28:40.280
going to rely on people who claim that they are actually the righteous ones they're actually the ones who know what's best for humanity and allow them to limit this new system new intelligence just so it will be aligned with human desires

28:40.280 --> 29:00.280
according to them as defined by that small group of people that is an interesting question right i actually know somebody who is a philosopher working for google and so you probably if you know whatever whoever is doing this work

29:00.280 --> 29:16.280
ai ethicists or whatever and it's a small group of people and then you might wonder why we are taking their words for it and that's

29:16.280 --> 29:22.280
we lost Peter it seems like there we go

29:22.280 --> 29:47.280
right on welcome back to Peter ladlow again so i wanted to say something about ai and the thing is that not only we're going to have like ai running our cars for example but right now in defy on the blockchain we have these decentralized autonomous organizations

29:47.280 --> 30:07.280
daos are down and and so for the most part there there's someone in charge of some developer that's in charge of like where these things go and maybe people vote on where they should go so they're decentralized in a way but someone is the key holder

30:07.280 --> 30:25.280
right that's going to actually launch the contracts or do whatever needs to be done with the contracts that are executed on the blockchain by this virtual corporate inception of it right because it will ultimately will be automated

30:25.280 --> 30:39.280
ultimately yes but the ones that exist now i mean someone is driving the car as it were someone is driving that that decentralized autonomous organization so so far they're not really decentralized

30:39.280 --> 30:47.280
there a little bit decentralized be in the sense that there are these governance tokens and if you own a share of the company you get to vote on it

30:47.280 --> 30:57.280
but there's nothing that says that the devs actually have to listen to what you're voting on and sometimes they don't i mean sometimes they just do whatever they want to do okay voting

30:57.280 --> 31:06.280
so your little governance tokens are technically they're inert however it is possible to structure this in such a way either that

31:06.280 --> 31:21.280
the you do your vote actually matters that is your voting on an actual piece of software right and there's no developer in the mix there right that you have to trust

31:21.280 --> 31:36.280
but an interesting thing happened a few months ago which was that there was a dow which was a it was one that was involved in lending money and generating interest on money that you deposited

31:36.280 --> 31:56.280
and something happened where i can't remember this was an accident or what but the the keys to drive the dow were accidentally burned and so i think so right now there is this decentralized autonomous organization that no one has any control over

31:56.280 --> 32:10.280
and it's going to be living on the blockchain for as long as the internet lives yeah all right so now wild it is wild yeah yeah yeah and so people can still interact with it if they want to you know

32:10.280 --> 32:35.280
so you could set up a little ai thing a learning ai give it a learning algorithm could set up several of these turn them loose burn the keys and you would have these decentralized corporations now that are run by ai's that would last that will outlast all of us

32:35.280 --> 32:56.280
right they're just good there's no there's no shutting them down and i find that to be pretty fascinating now no one as far as i know there are no ethicists talking about how these decentralized organizations ought to be structured

32:56.280 --> 33:10.280
what i just said is not entirely true because when you go into the governance groups for these dogs there are debates about what should and could be done and sometimes there are explicit ethical questions that people debate

33:10.280 --> 33:31.280
so there are people that are debating these ethical issues and it's not like you appoint a committee of ethicists to decide how it should proceed but the way it proceeds now is that there is a debate people raise an ethical issue about should we do this or should our da do this

33:31.280 --> 33:52.280
and then and then ultimately there's a vote on it right now the votes are structured so that the people with the most tokens have the most power the most voting power but that at least means that it's not the ethical decisions are not placed in the hands of a chosen few

33:52.280 --> 34:02.280
you actually have a spot where you debate the ethics of of what people are about to do

34:02.280 --> 34:31.280
i'm i i tend to find that i'm usually on the losing end of these debates but uh but they're it's interesting to engage in it's sort of philosophy in practice and uh it is somewhat decentralized although the power mostly rests with the people who the big whales that have the most tokens that have the most uh the most shares in the decentralized autonomous organization

34:31.280 --> 34:52.280
yeah i think it's obviously philosophy but it's becoming more and more practical because the only reason that you would want to have this say ethically speaking on any kind of an ai system is if that system is centralized that that would be the the ethics and morality within which that system will operate because if it's decentralized

34:52.280 --> 35:15.280
then let's say that you're familiar with a gi right uh singularity net ben gorsals so his whole thing is we are developing this platform that will give rise to a decentralized a gi the artificial general intelligence will not be centralized by either google or us government or a chinese communist party

35:15.280 --> 35:34.280
it will it will belong to whoever who needs uh to use it and it will attain information from all different agents from you know millions and millions of different applications that have their own system of governance and i think this is actually becoming more sensible from now on for most people

35:34.280 --> 35:52.280
because nevada just passed a bill that would allow tech companies to create governments they come up with their own basically rules and governance ideals and which is really interesting i'm just going to read a little a little part of it plan legislation to establish new

35:52.280 --> 36:14.280
business areas in nevada would allow technology companies to effectively form separate local governments the zones would permit companies with large areas of land to form governments carrying the same authority as counties including the ability to impose taxes form school districts and courts and provide government services

36:14.280 --> 36:35.280
my mind was blown that this is happening in nevada in the middle of all of this uh push for further and further centralized control by federal government and here we are which seems to be very timely and spot on that this is exactly what needs to happen now what will constitute a tech company that's a different story because if they can shut down

36:35.280 --> 36:55.280
parlor was a tech company who decided that parlor parlor shouldn't exist anymore you know so that's a problem what do you think what do you make of this so say there's some tech company controls my neighborhood google takes over i mean is that a good thing

36:55.280 --> 37:15.280
well google is doing it right now in part of toronto and that is not a good thing because people have no say in it whether or not they want to live in that area they already are living in it they're you know using everything that they've been using it but google has planted the smart city basically to

37:15.280 --> 37:33.280
harvest data and those are the areas that probably social credit system will kick in at first because they have more information on them but what this bill is saying is that let's say you and me form a tech company and they consider it to be a tech company

37:33.280 --> 37:48.280
and then we go and buy 200 acres of land and we basically create our own jurisdiction that would have as much power according to this as counties

37:48.280 --> 38:05.280
so we can be like we have our own token we allow autonomous cars we allow any kind of transhumanist experimentation and whatever and people also earn dividend based on their data contribution

38:05.280 --> 38:18.280
you know there's an old tradition of this with like company towns in the nineteen fifties it was a real phenomenon there were actually some some supreme one of the cases went to the supreme court

38:18.280 --> 38:25.280
because the the company that was in effect running the town

38:25.280 --> 38:40.280
was um censoring some i think i believe they were jehovah's witnesses that were out and about and the company the company said no you can't do that we can tell you whatever to do and it went all the way to the supreme court

38:40.280 --> 38:52.280
the supreme court ruled that well you know when you're a company town like that you're taking on all the functions of government so you have to respect the constitution of the united states when you get that much power over community

38:52.280 --> 39:12.280
but it i mean it's an interesting idea um i don't know if it's a great idea i mean i would like the idea much better if i knew that the people that were living in these company towns were free to move to another company town that is if they could shop for them

39:12.280 --> 39:35.280
that's not always the case you know people are bound to certain localities for for various reasons um i i tend to i tend to believe that we are often so concerned about governments and nation states and the power that they have an exercise

39:35.280 --> 39:56.280
that we're not always sensitive to the also very dangerous power that corporations can have over us we're seeing that recently with the power that the tech companies have accumulated um i i would be very nervous about

39:56.280 --> 40:18.280
about tech companies taking control of a local community in the way that we're envisioning here oh after monopolies i absolutely agree with you yeah i think one of the reasons that corporations become monopoly are because of um state nations or nation states that a federal government

40:18.280 --> 40:39.280
monopoly yeah yeah like google or amazon they wouldn't be as gigantic as they are without their elements inside dc that they try to challenge um what is that article 230 section 230 for many many months but nobody even wanted to address it and then you look at how much of

40:39.280 --> 40:56.280
uh or how many of these people in dc have gotten how much from each of these tech companies and you realize what what the game is really about it has nothing to do with the consumer yeah the thing with the tech companies though is that they it's sort of inevitable

40:56.280 --> 41:14.280
uh that they are going to accumulate massive power simply because of the network effect yeah so the one that guys the most network is going to get more nodes it's going to grow exponentially because the more people are that are that are in the network the more people

41:14.280 --> 41:33.280
that get attracted to the network and the more powerful the network becomes so i think that i think that the emergence of these sort of tech giants is not because of anything taking place in washington except that nobody did in washington

41:33.280 --> 41:55.280
anything in washington do buffer this effect you know um and no one has been serious about anti-trust legislation for these kinds of companies for a long long time and now they're merging together federal government and these tech companies

41:55.280 --> 42:11.280
yeah because when you have a powerful network the thing you want to be is part of that network yeah right and it's really weird it's an autonomous kind of process it's not something where

42:11.280 --> 42:28.280
little bald white men are sitting in it and you know around a mahogany desk planning this out is is just a kind of the natural way that things are now organizing themselves when you can create networks so easily with the help of the internet

42:28.280 --> 42:39.280
and so the more powerful the network it becomes a kind of attractor to other networks so everyone wants to be part of the board as it were

42:39.280 --> 42:44.280
it the ability to self-govern the example that i had in mind was seedetting

42:44.280 --> 42:47.280
familiar where see steading

42:45.280 --> 43:00.280
oh yeah yeah concept of creating permanent dwelling at c coles used to address outside a territory claim by any government determines a blend of c and homesteading a home sitting is basically self-sufficiency

43:00.280 --> 43:06.620
that they have their own institute and you know because US Constitution allowed

43:06.620 --> 43:11.100
the centralization of governance and I think it's a really interesting platform

43:11.100 --> 43:14.460
especially when there is a Chinese Communist Party on the other side of the

43:14.460 --> 43:20.820
spectrum to create a contrast and maybe this will be a push for states to take

43:20.820 --> 43:25.060
more control for themselves rather than the federal government and then there

43:25.060 --> 43:31.680
will be smaller tech companies if they be allowed to emerge and function that

43:31.680 --> 43:36.440
they'll be able to say buy a hundred acres of land because land is relatively

43:36.440 --> 43:40.160
cheap in the US as well and in the middle of nowhere and you create your

43:40.160 --> 43:44.800
own or maybe as an objective you set it down that you want to create a move

43:44.800 --> 43:50.440
towards that direction little by little well here's the thing first of all we

43:50.440 --> 43:53.640
were talking about tech companies like they're here to stay and I'm not sure

43:53.640 --> 44:01.160
that's true so once you get into things like decentralized finance is there

44:01.160 --> 44:09.160
actually something like a bank that exists you know now let's let's just take

44:09.160 --> 44:17.340
a platform there's one called Ave AAVE which is developed the head developer is

44:17.340 --> 44:22.240
a guy in Finland okay but the other developers are scattered all over the

44:22.240 --> 44:28.320
world so in some sense is not really located anywhere some of these platforms

44:28.320 --> 44:34.700
no one even knows who the developers are or where they are right so you know we

44:34.700 --> 44:40.360
think of corporations in the sense of well they're incorporated like well

44:40.360 --> 44:44.400
there's this fiction that there's these embodied things but once we get to

44:44.400 --> 44:48.560
things like decentralized autonomous organizations they don't really exist

44:48.560 --> 44:57.560
anywhere they don't need to be anywhere now is there any reason for them to buy

44:57.560 --> 45:02.080
some land in Iowa for example and create a city for the people there no

45:02.080 --> 45:06.560
there's really no reason for that their people could be in Mexico and Estonia

45:06.560 --> 45:18.560
and Latvia and and Brazil so so then the question is well what what will what will

45:18.560 --> 45:23.280
corporations look like I mean maybe the whole idea of a corporation goes the way

45:23.280 --> 45:31.120
of of you know like a tower a tower record store or something like that they

45:31.120 --> 45:35.360
are you know we got rid of the brick-and-mortar things but maybe we also

45:35.360 --> 45:41.200
get rid of the the corporation as this embodied individual it's sort of

45:41.200 --> 45:46.600
interesting I mentioned Ave which is this finished blockchain project and Ave

45:46.600 --> 45:51.120
actually is finished for a spirit or ghost or something like that so you have

45:51.120 --> 45:58.320
this sort of weird ghostly organization now that exists is it a corporation well

45:58.320 --> 46:02.560
it doesn't really exist anywhere it doesn't care who you are it doesn't care

46:02.560 --> 46:08.440
who I am it loan us money we can borrow money we can loan we can we can deposit

46:08.440 --> 46:14.780
money with them and it's all it's all secured by the contract it do they have

46:14.780 --> 46:28.200
any need for land I don't think so you know do they have any need for a city of

46:28.200 --> 46:33.400
some sort yeah but what if what if the startup is about building cities hey

46:33.400 --> 46:39.560
okay so that's that is an interesting idea so then right so well I mean there

46:39.560 --> 46:46.760
are these people that are working on the rethinking of what is a city and and I

46:46.760 --> 46:51.640
think what I know I am I mean I don't have a big enough brain to sort of

46:51.640 --> 46:57.040
rethink this I met an architect who actually works on this his name was

46:57.040 --> 47:04.200
Carlo Ratti and I think he's at MIT and also in Italy somewhere and his whole

47:04.200 --> 47:09.560
thing is sort of well how do you how do you rethink what a city is for example

47:09.560 --> 47:14.800
in in this sort of context could you think of cities as being completely

47:14.800 --> 47:19.360
diffused and online somehow well what what would that mean or could you think

47:19.360 --> 47:25.840
of a city as being in a virtual a virtual world for example or do you want

47:25.840 --> 47:31.200
to think of the city as being like a bunch of individuals that have like

47:31.200 --> 47:38.920
information flowing between them in some particular way and now say you want to

47:38.920 --> 47:43.640
build a city where people can live together I think this is what you're

47:43.640 --> 47:49.000
talking about or a village or a colony whatever yeah yeah yeah yeah let's build

47:49.000 --> 48:02.240
a commune of artists or or trans humanists or something like that I mean

48:02.240 --> 48:10.400
definitely possible now the question is what with all this new technology and

48:10.400 --> 48:18.800
this sort of revolution and I thinking about what is a corporation or what is

48:18.800 --> 48:24.880
a city how will that change what a commune would look like in the future I

48:24.880 --> 48:30.920
mean I tried to think about this in in that book I edited crypto-anarchy cyber

48:30.920 --> 48:36.160
states and pirate utopias I mean that was the sort of headline idea well what

48:36.160 --> 48:42.000
does a cyber state look like you know how are the governance structures created

48:42.000 --> 48:46.480
how does it protect itself how does it defend itself how does it protect itself

48:46.480 --> 48:53.800
from outside interference and so forth and I I didn't have the answer to those

48:53.800 --> 49:00.960
questions then and I I still don't have the answer to those questions yeah I

49:00.960 --> 49:07.120
think a lot of it comes down to the gridlock of humanity that we you know we

49:07.120 --> 49:11.560
have a tool we build stuff with it and we destroy stuff with it and that is

49:11.560 --> 49:19.440
like a dilemma at the core of who we are yeah you think you know the internet

49:19.440 --> 49:23.240
comes in and you think it's going to be this thing that opens up free expression

49:23.240 --> 49:27.600
and liberates this and so forth and it becomes like the greatest tool for the

49:27.600 --> 49:32.720
surveillance ever invented you know and so the danger is everyone sees all the

49:32.720 --> 49:37.200
positive potential that's coming out of blockchain technology and decentralized

49:37.200 --> 49:42.880
you know autonomous organizations and trustless systems but we're not very

49:42.880 --> 49:48.680
good at anticipating the evil side of these things when when they when they

49:48.680 --> 49:55.240
come into existence and you know we have this idea of like utopian communities

49:55.240 --> 50:00.880
but and the thought is well maybe this will make those utopian communities

50:00.880 --> 50:07.320
easier to build and sustain and yes that's possible but it's also possible

50:07.320 --> 50:12.680
these technologies end up unraveling those kinds of communities and making

50:12.680 --> 50:20.560
them harder to construct yeah absolutely we just don't know I guess I don't know

50:20.560 --> 50:25.920
yeah no no neither do I times that's the thing yeah there's a group of people who

50:25.920 --> 50:30.440
in you know insists that they do know and they want to prove it to everyone

50:30.440 --> 50:43.000
else yeah well they can insist I mean that's the thing right now there are so

50:43.000 --> 50:46.400
many I mean it's exciting that there's so many smart people coming into this

50:46.400 --> 50:53.880
space to sort of rethink finance rethink communities online and so forth but when

50:53.880 --> 50:57.880
you get really smart people together and they start inventing stuff at that point

50:57.880 --> 51:02.960
it becomes very very difficult to predict what comes next yeah so it you

51:02.960 --> 51:08.160
know in 2007 would you have predict Satoshi's white paper and the emergence

51:08.160 --> 51:14.160
of Bitcoin and all of that no you know when I first saw the World Wide Web for

51:14.160 --> 51:19.520
the first time I thought what what is this you know what what am I gonna do

51:19.520 --> 51:24.880
with this you know and so you know I don't think we saw right away what the

51:24.880 --> 51:29.600
internet was going to be about it took I mean this is true of all inventions it

51:29.600 --> 51:34.880
goes back to things like the phonograph Edison thought that his invention of the

51:34.880 --> 51:39.320
phonograph was going to be used as a kind of dictaphone so that so that people

51:39.320 --> 51:44.760
could you know record things for their secretaries to transcribe right he

51:44.760 --> 51:51.400
couldn't imagine the entertainment end of that so we're in this period that's

51:51.400 --> 51:55.840
going to be full of lots of inventions and we don't know what those inventions

51:55.840 --> 52:01.420
are going to be we probably can't know what they're going to be and as often

52:01.420 --> 52:09.640
the case is going to be lots of promise a promise of dismantling the old order

52:09.640 --> 52:16.920
of finance which has been grotesque in its unfairness now the question is will

52:16.920 --> 52:24.240
it will it construct something better will it help bank the the unbanked in

52:24.240 --> 52:30.120
the world will it make easier for people in Nigeria for example to get money to

52:30.120 --> 52:36.760
start a business will it eliminate onerous debts that people have to pay

52:36.760 --> 52:41.920
to you know when they borrow money will it will it eliminate these incredible

52:41.920 --> 52:46.600
expenses to transmit money you know for immigrants to transfer money to Mexico

52:46.600 --> 52:52.280
for example in Guatemala I mean the rates are outrageous you know will will

52:52.280 --> 52:58.540
it make the situation better for those people it has that promise but I mean my

52:58.540 --> 53:02.440
experience with these things lately is with the internet and everything else is

53:02.440 --> 53:09.520
that in spite of the promise there's also always something very creepy and and

53:09.520 --> 53:18.040
anti-liberating that comes with it either control or surveillance or or some such

53:18.040 --> 53:24.560
thing and and so I'm like equal parts excited and equal parts mortified by

53:24.560 --> 53:32.080
what is to come so as a philosopher I had this I asked the same question a

53:32.080 --> 53:38.920
manure a scientist as a philosopher do you think tyranny is closer to the

53:38.920 --> 53:44.360
default state of human nature or liberty because I look at children and they're

53:44.360 --> 53:48.720
the biggest tyrants ever and they don't even understand that it's wrong that hey

53:48.720 --> 53:52.020
it is what I want and if you don't give it to me I'm gonna break stuff and cry

53:52.020 --> 53:56.180
and do all of those things is perfectly normal there must be some kind of an

53:56.180 --> 54:04.260
exterior force to move them away from that kind of a perspective so I began

54:04.260 --> 54:08.600
thinking about tyranny if you just allow people to go they move towards

54:08.600 --> 54:13.880
tyranny because it's closer to their nature but it requires foundations and

54:13.880 --> 54:24.720
the structures to build to erect liberty for lack of a better term I tend you get

54:24.720 --> 54:30.440
this debate about whether people are inherently libertarian or tyrannical which

54:30.440 --> 54:39.000
system they prefer I tend to think that the natural state is one of flux we even

54:39.000 --> 54:43.320
Plato talked about this you would get this cycle you know from tyranny to this

54:43.320 --> 54:50.600
to oligarchy to to democracy and then back to tyranny right and and I think

54:50.600 --> 54:57.520
that certain humans are disposed to one system and certain to another and

54:57.520 --> 55:07.200
humanity as a whole kind of oscillates between these two different systems now

55:07.200 --> 55:13.520
whether that's good or bad or avoidable I don't know but that is the state of

55:13.520 --> 55:20.640
things is that we oscillate between these systems and we are in a stage of

55:20.640 --> 55:26.720
oscillation right now I mean you know I I don't know exactly what these periods

55:26.720 --> 55:31.360
are but you know I'm inclined to say that

55:33.120 --> 55:37.600
maybe every 50 years maybe ever a hundred year every 50 years we got a

55:37.600 --> 55:46.600
kind of revolutionary moment so if you think about 1968 for example with lots

55:46.600 --> 55:55.920
of revolutionary periods going on around the world and then you go back to 1917

55:55.920 --> 56:04.360
1920s with the rise of totalitarian movements and you go back to 1848 with

56:04.360 --> 56:10.320
uprisings throughout Europe and so you keep going back to these revolutionary

56:10.320 --> 56:23.800
moments and often these revolutionary moments involve some sort of shift

56:23.800 --> 56:32.600
between being between tyranny and and liberty one direction or the other mm-hmm

56:32.600 --> 56:40.640
yeah I don't think it's good and bad it just says this just who we are I think

56:40.640 --> 56:46.800
it's bad but it's like you know it's like complaining when it rains on your

56:46.800 --> 56:51.520
picnic you know I can't I know it's not much I can do exactly do you think these

56:51.520 --> 56:57.400
cycles that you're saying always have had something to do with technology

57:01.000 --> 57:07.200
that's an interesting thought I mean suppose I'm right that there's a there

57:07.200 --> 57:15.800
was a revolutionary movement in the late 1960s was that because of the emergence

57:15.800 --> 57:22.680
of tele media certain media also LSD itself for example this technology I

57:22.680 --> 57:30.520
consider technology anything that quantify an idea that's a good point

57:30.520 --> 57:35.280
that could have been a big part of it yes that could have been a big part of

57:35.280 --> 57:39.600
it yes and that you're quite correct to call that a technology yeah because the

57:39.600 --> 57:44.040
way I'm looking at this we have evolved with and because of our technology and

57:44.040 --> 57:48.120
our technology has evolved with and because of us but what has happened is

57:48.120 --> 57:54.320
that we evolved linearly but our technology evolves exponentially and at

57:54.320 --> 58:01.720
some point I don't know exactly when but it it increased the speed of progress

58:01.720 --> 58:08.000
and advancement technologically speaking far beyond our capability of being able

58:08.000 --> 58:12.640
to catch up with it that's why I consider smartphones and social media in

58:12.640 --> 58:17.400
the hands of humans like monkeys with machine guns we don't know what to do

58:17.400 --> 58:23.360
with them we're amazed by them we do whatever we can do with them but they

58:23.360 --> 58:28.040
are just advancing and progressing much much faster than we do that's why I

58:28.040 --> 58:32.720
think Neuralink is a really really interesting thing if it's done and

58:32.720 --> 58:37.160
implemented in a decentralized kind of a way because if it's done centrally then

58:37.160 --> 58:43.240
that would be also the biggest instrument of slavery and human and human civilization

58:43.240 --> 58:48.400
that would be something yes that would be something you know I rewatched our

58:48.400 --> 58:53.320
previous interview to prep for this and we did talk about this the monkeys with

58:53.320 --> 59:01.760
the phones and all yes and you know I used to think that technology was

59:01.760 --> 59:09.720
pulling away from us very very rapidly and clearly there's a sense in which it

59:09.720 --> 59:15.600
is on the other hand if you combine that with this idea which we also talked

59:15.600 --> 59:25.400
about which was the X external theory of mind right and if you thought of well if

59:25.400 --> 59:30.160
you think like David Chalmers does that you know your phone is an extension of

59:30.160 --> 59:36.160
your mind then actually you know as this phone gets more and more powerful it is

59:36.160 --> 59:41.160
an extension of your mind it is a part of your mind so you are growing with

59:41.160 --> 59:46.000
that phone but if it's not interpreted if it's interpreted then it is your

59:46.000 --> 59:50.360
conditional mind condition on the satisfaction of the person who's

59:50.360 --> 59:54.800
interpreting that information like when I'm searching for something on Google if

59:54.800 --> 01:00:01.400
the algorithm is really going to show me what I would want to see not what the

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:05.720
bar the algorithms bosses want me to see then that would be absolutely correct

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:08.760
oh I see

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:16.960
that's an interesting point then if I have bunch of electrodes in my head and

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:23.840
that would let's say control when I'm when I feel shame and anger but the rest

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:29.200
of the stuff I decide for myself it will ultimately affect every aspect of my

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:35.800
experience so if the idea is that well here here we have this phone and and

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:40.240
geez it is an extension of my mind but on the other hand there are these apps

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:49.400
on it that are are basically using using behavior well sorry using behavioral

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:56.520
economics to manipulate me and so it it's like although it's making me in some

01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:03.520
sense smarter it is also taking away my agency and thereby making me dumber at

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:13.040
the same time so it's sort of like it it's it's taking my mind away in the

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:18.720
same sense that it might be adding adding to it if that makes any sense yeah

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:24.980
I think it creates a matrix it creates there's a quote by Gore Vidal that we

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:28.080
don't even know what our cage looks like because we've never seen it from the

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:35.160
outside so when people are not familiar with what is being done to them through

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:39.600
information and tailoring of information that is not tailored to them but it's

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:44.360
tailored to some kind of an outside bias and agenda and interest then they don't

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:47.260
realize it they think that they're making the decision this is what they

01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:52.440
like this is what they don't like but more you learn about the cage and when

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:56.400
you have the opportunity to peek from outside of it then I think that's a

01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:01.560
different story because throughout history we have done that you know there

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:05.520
are people who've peeked outside of the cages and the simulation that can be

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:10.600
social it doesn't necessarily have to be technological they peeked from outside

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:16.040
of it and then they brought back certain information on certain rays of light for

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:20.200
other people to realize that hey what we're experiencing is not all there is

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:25.320
it's a condition kind of an experience that has been designed and contained

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:33.600
based on the interest and agenda of our betters superiors right so what would

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:38.360
the good version of this story be that let's say that we didn't have a

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:43.640
centralized Apple we have a decentralized system and so whatever

01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:52.280
software is in my phone it's completely decentralized and it's actually among

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:56.080
other things it would probably pay me for the attention I give to something

01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:01.560
it's not for the data that we contribute exactly yeah yeah yeah so so it is now

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:06.280
now I can do all the surfing I want to do no one's steering me to do it I'm

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:16.840
getting paid to do the surfing is that am I in a more liberated condition in

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:23.960
that in that scenario and the individual basis I think you are but nothing will

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:28.520
work like that because it's like we're going to school to be prepared for very

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:33.480
specific determined funnels throughout society we're not like we're not going to

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:36.480
Montessori a school all of us that they will tell us hey you do whatever you

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:40.680
want to do you want to play play right because the society wouldn't wouldn't

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:48.200
operate on that basis well I mean this is one of the promises I don't know if

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:53.960
it can keep the promises I mean this is one of the promises of blockchain

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:59.000
technology and media that would exist upon it which is that there's no

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:06.960
centralized owner of all this no one so each of each individual on there is the

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:16.200
owner of the data right um so you are now free to sell your data for and that

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:19.960
that data would be you know it's a piece of data that I'm looking at something

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:26.040
right it's a piece of data that I'm watching Wheel of Fortune on TV and I

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:34.440
can sell that data no one has any let's say no one has any particular well I

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:40.240
don't know I mean I don't know really I don't have it figured out but this does

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:44.560
seem to be that there is a kind of liberating potential in in here

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:52.720
potentially yeah yeah yeah yeah and technologically I think we can go

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:58.040
beyond all other limitations that has been put on our shoulder because of our

01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:02.160
again I'm not saying it's fully bad or fully good but when you're born into a

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:05.400
culture there are certain things that are placed on your shoulder for the rest

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:10.880
of your life unless you become conscious of them and make a choice that hey I was

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:15.160
born in Iran maybe I like Persian food but I don't like Persian jealousy for

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:20.200
example right but it's been on my shoulder all my life because that's what

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:23.600
I learned that's the society that I grew up in and then I went to school they

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:28.200
told me certain things that they wanted me to learn in order to serve the bigger

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:32.800
context that they had in mind right which they themselves like teachers and

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:37.080
principals and all that they themselves could have been just an auto autopilot

01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:40.240
mode that hey this is the right thing to do this is this is what we have to do

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:46.440
day after day after day after day and I think this big of a shock to a system is

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:51.200
waking a lot of people up to realize that a lot of structures centralized

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:55.320
structures of authorities that they had relied on and identified with they're

01:05:55.320 --> 01:06:00.960
basically sandcastles and they're falling apart yes I mean it's interesting

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:08.920
that you put the point about how we are raised within certain kinds of religious

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:13.720
or ethical communities and so forth I mean this was a people don't talk about

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:17.840
that very much but like John Stuart Mill did talk about it and on Liberty he

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:23.000
says well there are many many sources of oppression I mean it might be a

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:32.040
government it could be a corporation but it could also be the church it could

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:37.960
just be the neighbor the moors of the community the you know just the attitudes

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:42.720
of your community can also be a source of oppression your own family your own

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:51.800
family can be a source of oppression yes yeah so the question is with these

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:59.120
changes that are coming you know will that liberate us from the full spectrum

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:08.120
of causes of oppression yeah that's a very good question I don't think we know

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:17.680
the answer I don't know the answer there we'll have to talk again in a few after

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:23.080
things fall apart we'll get together I never saw that coming yeah I was

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:28.800
watching someone on just a clip from Glenn Beck yesterday is the economist he

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:34.080
was talking about the crash of a market is coming within the next 45 days and he

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:39.680
believed that this will be the end of central banks the same way that Catholic

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:46.480
Church basically collapsed when it did that they will lose all control because

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:51.080
this this is a kind of a damage that he was saying we burst the housing bubble

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:56.600
in 2008 this is the everything bubble that is going to burst and it will have

01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:03.120
a massive effect on all these institutions it will be very interesting

01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:10.640
if all the central banks go under yeah whether

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:20.280
whether that could happen I mean I don't know it's you mean there's stirrings of

01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:25.200
this you know I mean you do have alternatives now you know we do have

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:31.640
Bitcoin out there you don't need to rely on someone to print print money for you

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:36.960
you know so maybe maybe the age of sovereign currencies is coming to the

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:43.720
end yeah this reminds me of what Buckminster Fuller said that it's

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:49.160
basically pointless to fight an existing system you build a better alternative

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:55.200
that make the existing system obsolete Bitcoin is the best example of that

01:08:55.200 --> 01:09:00.160
yeah you don't tear apart the boat you're on unless you have a better

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:09.800
boat to get exactly yeah so that's I mean we will see if if these blockchain

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:16.600
protocols and the decentralized finance really work out then things are going to

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:21.200
get very very interesting very fast because then we're going to have clear

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:28.720
alternatives to the financial system and you there will be a real question about

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:37.320
whether we need central banks at all yeah hey let's talk just briefly I know

01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:44.520
we've been talking gone on and off so for a while this tokenization and

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:47.800
decentralization that we're talking about we mainly talked about in finance

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:52.120
but it goes well beyond finance for example there was an example of a

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:57.080
Manhattan apartment a 30 million dollar real estate property in Manhattan that

01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:01.760
got tokenized with blockchain and now what is happening is the crypto art

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:12.840
scene with NFTs they're non non fungible tokens and it's mind-blowing and amazing

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:16.720
would you explain a little bit of what is going on with that respect in the

01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:22.320
world of for example digital art and the potential of this thing moving forward

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:29.400
sure the basic idea is that you can tokenize anything so the the best

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:36.120
example of NFTs non fungible tokens is if you remember crypto kitties yes where

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:40.800
you could you you had a bunch of these little did you do you have crypto kitties

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:44.440
I don't know I don't even know if I can't go back to the site because when

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:48.720
it came out I got a bunch of them and traded and I haven't used it in like

01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:56.960
maybe two years do you remember your wallet address no they must be yeah so

01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:00.800
there are these cats and you could breed them and then it was sort of using some

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:06.560
algorithm or generate new cats and then you you know they each of them is

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:13.680
identifiable there's only one such cat because it's sort of like linked to a

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:19.200
location on the blockchain as it were and it's like and it also shows that I

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:23.960
own that crypto kitty so you know someone could like obviously Photoshop

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:28.600
or you know do a screen capture and create a cat that looks just like mine

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:35.440
but it's not my crypto kitty so I could I could create a work of art likewise and

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:43.640
I know the ownership is determined in the blockchain itself I own this piece

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:49.480
of art now someone can do a screen capture of that they could send it out

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:54.040
but I'm the one who owns the quote-unquote official just like you can

01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:57.160
have lots of photo you know you could have lots of copies of the Mona Lisa

01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:02.120
but there's only one similarly we can we can show this ownership on the

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:07.160
blockchain and it is it's a lot of fun it's a lot of fun to track these these

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:11.200
crypto artists that are creating these NFTs and some of them are really cool if

01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:16.680
you if you on Twitter you can follow a bunch of them and they'll show you their

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:20.920
work I'm intending to not follow them because then I want to spend money on

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:27.200
them and it's you know it's it gets to be an expensive hobby now in the real

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:32.760
estate case the idea is that I could let's say buy a building that's 30

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:37.080
million dollars well no before we get to that let's go to artwork let's say that

01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:42.880
someone wanted a painting that's 30 30 million dollars we could tokenize that

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:48.960
we could we could split up the token right so that I could have like a tenth

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:54.680
of a percent of this painting right so someone could have a fancy painting none

01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:58.820
of us can actually afford it we could all get together and own like a some

01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:02.640
sort of share how do you know that I own it well it's right there on the

01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:08.640
blockchain now the reason this is interesting in real estate is because if

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:13.440
you live in a part of the world other than say the United States and certain

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:21.240
very developed countries the issue of title to property is not always clear so

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:26.520
here in Mexico for example there are lots of little title companies all over

01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:33.200
the place they're called notarios and they keep a record of who owns what but

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:40.640
they're not always honest players right so if some narco goes into the office

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:45.840
and says you're gonna give me that land and then you know they'll just change it

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:54.520
and that's it okay so the question is we have this really obsolete system for

01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:59.720
keeping track of who owns what well what if you move that to the blockchain

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:06.120
right so that everyone on the blockchain can see well anyone with access to the

01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:10.800
blockchain which means everybody can look and see who owns what property when

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:15.960
they bought it who they bought it from how much they paid for it etc all of

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:24.440
that information is in this kind of immutable record now that I actually I'm

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:29.880
talking to someone here next week about this because they're working on a deal

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:34.320
in Mexico where they want they have some real estate investments that they want

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:40.200
to tokenize in exactly this way put it on the blockchain let people buy a

01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:47.440
fractional share in certain kinds of property in in in the on the Caribbean

01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:56.640
coast here okay so so any sort of thing could have a tokenized representative so

01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:00.920
any sort of stock for example so one of the things that people have done is

01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:10.200
create virtual versions of GameStop Tesla and so forth so you that you can

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:16.840
trade these synthetic versions of these assets you don't have to trade you don't

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:21.080
have to trade the quote-unquote real-world version of it you can trade

01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:26.120
the synthetic version of it and the synthetic version uses oracles to track

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:32.840
the price of the so-called real-world version of the asset so so that allows

01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:37.200
some very speedy trading right so like it's not a big process I have to go to

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:41.160
my broker I don't have it you know you and I could just swap these things right

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:46.120
now I'll give you my Tesla for you give me your GameStop boom we do it right

01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:57.880
like that so so what's going to happen is that there are these exchanges

01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:04.760
distributed exchanges no one owns them right uniswap is one there's a prime

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:09.000
example and people are trading crypto on those but you could trade anything you

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.800
can trade a tokenized version of anything on it you could trade real

01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:17.680
estate on it you could trade stocks on it you could trade anything that's

01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:22.080
tokenizable which is basically anything so one thing you could do is like you

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:31.840
say say you see an artist on YouTube for example or or I don't know

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:36.680
twitch or anywhere right and you see an artist and you really like this artist

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:41.160
and what you could do is buy a share in that artists right the artist could

01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:45.760
issue tokens and I'm gonna buy it now right because we're betting on the

01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:51.800
future of that artist so artists and performers could tokenize themselves in

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:58.720
order to raise money or to get to and then people you know early people that

01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:05.480
find these people early right could ultimately benefit from that so it's

01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:10.760
like it's like finding a small cap corporation or a small cap crypto early

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:18.280
right so lots of possibilities and so the way we engage with artists the way

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:24.640
that artists get paid the way that stocks are traded the way all of these

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:29.600
things are going to radically radically change this is a much more radical

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:36.440
revolution than we got with the internet I mean it is it's the most radical

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:41.760
revolution we've seen in a long time I mean maybe since the invention of

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:47.680
agriculture you know I mean it's at that level so you're gonna have like

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:52.120
industrial well sorry invention of agriculture I suppose the Industrial

01:17:52.120 --> 01:18:02.440
Revolution the internet maybe but I think this sort of blockchain technology

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:10.000
is much much bigger than the internet because it actually changes how it sort

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:15.560
of tears apart these silos where all the information was kept it tears apart the

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:23.080
silos where all the power was stored and distributes that and as I said it's

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:27.000
very promising but like always we don't know where the danger is yet yeah

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.400
because the other side of it are powers who are losing power as a consequence of

01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:36.000
this revolution so they will do anything they can yes like a movie and in the

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:42.120
good characters and bad characters what are the bad guys going to do now so what

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:47.720
do you think about the bad guys going to do I mean one of the things you do is

01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:53.720
you try and throw regulations at people you can try and ban Bitcoin you could

01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:59.160
try and ban you know countries try to ban cryptocurrencies we'll see if that

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:03.440
works yeah or you try and regulate them or so you know what one of the things

01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:08.440
that people try and do is absorb absorb it you know a lot of these banks are

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:12.000
going to be sitting on top of the blockchain very very soon they're gonna

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.160
get permission to do things on the blockchain and so then what happens when

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:20.200
they enter that game you know because they're not gonna die then I guess they

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:25.680
all say we're gonna go away no they are they're going to once they can't beat it

01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:31.000
that then they're going to try and absorb it somehow yeah very interesting

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:38.840
decade ahead yes very interesting since you listened to the last episode we

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:43.680
talked about have you changed your mind about the last question the alien I love

01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:49.360
my last question I love my answer to the last question okay right on yeah I

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:55.520
forgot what it was though but I remember that I love it so the question was so

01:19:55.520 --> 01:20:03.840
the so the question was wait so the question was that you come across and

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:07.560
it's the best thing what's the best thing and the worst thing of humanity

01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:19.200
yeah of humanity and what do you think now no I'm trying to remember the best

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:23.480
thing was also the worst thing right all that I said well what is it that I said

01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:28.120
that was the best I remember but I tell you this you and two other guests like

01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:32.600
three right after each other they said something that it was also the best and

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:37.360
and the worst and for me it was really interesting it was because I was

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:40.640
thinking about dropping the question I got myself to a point that there is no

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:45.680
good and bad but it depends on the perspective and the context but you guys

01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:50.720
three of you and you know all three prominence people but from different

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:55.040
fields was like you know this this thing is the best one but it's also can be the

01:20:55.040 --> 01:21:04.880
worst one yeah dude I wish I remembered what I said impressed with myself or

01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:09.720
whatever it was I said hey it's exactly what we talked to me but I'll have to

01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:14.320
rewatch the interview yeah exactly what we talked about I think throughout this

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:19.720
episode that what all these promises that are brought because of technology

01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:25.960
can also lead to very nightmarish hellish kind of places so the spirit

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:31.200
carries on I think from that episode to now yeah definitely and it's a hell that

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:34.520
we can't even imagine yet that's the yeah we don't know what we don't know

01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:43.680
that's that's the most important part all right man this was at least we know

01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:49.200
well probably don't know it we don't know yeah what did they say that there

01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:52.480
are things we know we know there are things we know we don't know and there

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:57.200
are things we don't know that we don't know yeah and I think that's that's

01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:03.120
mostly that's most of what's out there we don't know what we don't know yeah

01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:20.960
we're gonna find out

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:35.220
you
