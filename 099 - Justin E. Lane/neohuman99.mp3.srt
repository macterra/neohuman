1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
when you overly centralize power

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,080
or you overly centralize the culture,

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,840
like the cultural permissibility,

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,480
you end up breaking the system.

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,660
And the fact of the matter is just that,

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,000
humans are different, like we're all different.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,200
And that's the cool thing about us, actually.

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,440
It's what I love the most is,

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,980
when I talk to somebody,

10
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,080
you don't know what's gonna happen, right?

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,080
They could be end up being your best friend

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,900
or you could just be like, I didn't like that guy at all.

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,740
Right?

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,560
And it's just, that's our beauty and that's our curse, right?

15
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,840
Cause sometimes we're too different to get along.

16
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,620
And other times we're just different enough to cooperate,

17
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,760
but we're not gonna be friends, but we'll be colleagues,

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,440
like, you know, and everything in between.

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,960
And when you overly centralize power

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,360
to people of a specific kind of belief

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,080
or a specific kind of background,

22
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,320
you're always going to neglect the people

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,720
that are towards the extremity

24
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,840
of wherever you sit on that spectrum.

25
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,480
And so that is never going to create stability

26
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,120
because eventually everyone else

27
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,120
is gonna start teaming up on you

28
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,780
and you're going to effectively be an imperialist

29
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,380
within your own country.

30
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,800
And this happens whenever you see

31
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,980
the centralization of power, right?

32
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,880
Every single major historical example

33
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,680
of a complex society that has collapsed,

34
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,680
has collapsed effectively because it overly centralized

35
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,000
economic decision-making and overly pushed that

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,640
to deal with problems that it itself was creating.

37
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,640
["The 100th Episode"]

38
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,640
All right, Justin, Elaine,

39
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,840
welcome to what's supposed to be the 100th episode.

40
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,720
I know I told you that,

41
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,200
but my guests canceled on the day of,

42
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,480
so we're on the 99th episode of Neo Human Podcast.

43
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,280
Still a pretty good number.

44
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,800
That's a very good number.

45
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,460
That's a very good number.

46
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,360
Yeah, thank you.

47
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,200
Thank you for your time

48
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,440
and thank you for being here, man.

49
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,260
Really appreciate it.

50
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,200
Yeah, thanks for having me.

51
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,040
I'm happy to be here.

52
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,000
I think this is gonna be fun.

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,320
Yeah, I saw you on War Room

54
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,280
and I thought your research

55
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,240
is about something very, very interesting.

56
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,200
It's about, from my perspective,

57
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,600
about the tool and the intention behind the tool,

58
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,700
which is AI and religion.

59
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,080
So I'm hoping that we get to that,

60
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,880
but before getting into any of that,

61
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,120
I'm talking about your book.

62
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,760
You also have a new book.

63
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,000
Congratulations about that.

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,920
Understanding Religion Through Artificial Intelligence,

65
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,880
Bonding, and Belief.

66
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,420
We'll be talking about that too,

67
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,920
but just so we can have some kind of a context,

68
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,160
let's start with your background,

69
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,960
the works you've done, the lives you've lived,

70
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,800
and what are you mainly focused on now these days?

71
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,240
Yeah, so I've lived many lives

72
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,920
in my short time on this earth.

73
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,960
I've been very blessed in that regard.

74
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,520
So I'm originally from the DC area,

75
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,920
kind of grew up in a really small town

76
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,040
on the Eastern Shore of Maryland,

77
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,440
where it's just chicken coops and corn fields mostly.

78
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,720
And that's, it kind of ties back in later,

79
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,640
which is why I mentioned this.

80
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,000
I did my undergraduate studies in religion, actually,

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,120
at the University of Vermont,

82
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,920
where I got really interested actually

83
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,920
in this idea that every culture

84
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,280
and every group of people

85
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,360
throughout all of human history has had religion.

86
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,320
And I grew up in the Methodist Church,

87
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,360
and I had a really positive experience in the church

88
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,320
as a kid for the most part.

89
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,820
And then, of course, I was in high school around 9-11.

90
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,460
And on the one hand, I have my personal experience,

91
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,920
which is positive with religion.

92
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,740
It was really a bedrock for my family growing up.

93
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,440
And then, of course, I also see

94
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,560
that religion can breed terrorism.

95
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,220
And so it kind of just led to a lot of questions in my mind.

96
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,400
And I kind of set off to try and answer the question of,

97
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,400
why do people do things that are so irrational

98
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,080
as kill themselves in the name of their God?

99
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,640
But then also, how can this one thing,

100
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,960
how can these deeply held beliefs

101
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,440
and how can our faith inspire both beauty and horror?

102
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,200
And it kind of set me off in that curiosity,

103
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,120
that curiosity set me off in my direction.

104
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,240
I realized around the time

105
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,680
that I was finishing my degree, actually,

106
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,080
that being able to program computers,

107
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,280
it was a skill that I had that was fairly unique

108
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,600
amongst people who study religion.

109
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,900
Most people who study religion, they read texts.

110
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,240
My languages in college were Latin and ancient Greek,

111
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,160
not Python or Java,

112
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,200
which is what I use to study religion now.

113
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,000
So it really kind of set me down that path.

114
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,360
And I realized I had to go to Europe

115
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,960
to kind of study this further.

116
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,440
American universities

117
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,480
are not into a scientific approach to religion.

118
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,120
They really want to push this sort of like

119
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,720
hard post-modernist ideology.

120
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,640
They want to look at cultural relativism

121
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,480
and everything has to be described.

122
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,440
And science is just kind of like

123
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,520
lensing this imperial patriarchy

124
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,200
over top of other people.

125
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,960
And that wasn't going anywhere for me.

126
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,480
It really, I needed to be able

127
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,480
to use the scientific approach.

128
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,480
And so I went to Belfast, actually, in Northern Ireland.

129
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,800
Of course, Belfast is well known for the troubles

130
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,140
that they've had between the Protestants and the Catholics

131
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,880
for years, for decades at this point.

132
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,040
And so living there kind of also framed it.

133
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,900
And I said, okay, well, I've studied conflict,

134
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,000
I've studied AI,

135
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,640
and now I also want to try and study stability.

136
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,080
And so I did my doctoral research at Oxford University

137
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,520
where for part of that, actually,

138
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,000
and I did my doctoral research

139
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,880
in anthropology department, believe it or not,

140
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,920
where I used data science and AI

141
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,680
to try and answer critical questions

142
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,000
about why large scale religions persist

143
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,720
the way they do today.

144
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,760
And I went to Singapore actually to validate this

145
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,360
because Singapore is the most religiously diverse nation

146
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,200
on earth.

147
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,040
And it is insanely stable

148
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,200
given its levels of diversity on every metric.

149
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,500
So it's kind of an anomaly.

150
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,800
So I wanted to study that and see, you know,

151
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,620
what can I learn?

152
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,160
How can I compare it to Belfast?

153
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,720
How can I compare it to what I see in America?

154
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,100
You know, what does that kind of mean?

155
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,120
And that kind of set me off on my journey

156
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,360
of what brought me to Europe and went back,

157
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,540
did some teaching and some work at Boston University

158
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:35,420
for a few years as a postdoctoral fellow

159
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,640
at the Center for Mind and Culture

160
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,260
and then came back to Europe and started working,

161
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,680
really doing consultancy and then started a private company

162
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,440
that does work in simulation and data analytics

163
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,380
to try and help people, you know, navigate social media

164
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,200
without having to rely on censorship

165
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,640
and without having to rely on the sensationalist algorithms

166
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,840
of like Twitter and Facebook

167
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,000
to kind of promote material in a negative way.

168
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,760
So trying to, you know, make social media fun again.

169
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,540
That's a noble objective.

170
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:12,540
Thanks, I might be doomed to fail, but I'm doomed to try.

171
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,420
Well, I mean, it really is about,

172
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,260
you mentioned you were wondering about how religion

173
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,180
give birth to the worst and the best of humanity,

174
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,520
but it really seems to be the natural,

175
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,780
undeniable natural reality of who we are

176
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,060
that we are capable of doing the worst

177
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,820
and we are capable of doing the best.

178
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,460
And, you know, some would even say

179
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,540
that one wouldn't exist without the other.

180
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,180
So we have to take them all together.

181
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,540
So this is an interesting point with respect to religions

182
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,340
and then AI, because AI is being used

183
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,060
as an underlaying of some kind of a system

184
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,540
that as you put it, brings some kind of a stability

185
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,140
with respect or we're having in mind

186
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,340
to have a certain degree of respect

187
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,140
for diversity of thoughts and ideas and perspectives

188
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,660
and, you know, all those kinds of philosophies

189
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,500
and worldviews.

190
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,820
Yeah, I think, yeah, and I also think, you know,

191
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,300
it's interesting to think of those things

192
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,220
as, you know, the positive with the negative.

193
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,500
You know, in some cases, religion is a tool

194
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,980
that people leverage for their own means, right?

195
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,900
A lot of people pick and choose different things

196
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,020
in a religious text just to justify what they're gonna do

197
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,260
and what they really wanna do is political actually.

198
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,700
And they just want religion to justify it.

199
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,060
It's a flag that they fly more than anything else.

200
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,700
And in that regards, you know, any tool

201
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,940
when it's used for good can do great things

202
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,460
and when it's used for evil can do horrible things, right?

203
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,820
So, you know, AI also is like that.

204
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,020
Artificial intelligence, of course,

205
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,020
can automate all sorts of interesting things.

206
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:55,100
You know, it protects us from fraud on our credit cards,

207
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,540
but it also is exacerbating social instability globally,

208
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,500
I think, because of the way that it selectively promotes

209
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,860
sensationalism on social media

210
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,740
and the way that it's constantly pinging us,

211
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,900
you know, in our brains, basically, you know,

212
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,540
quite literally, I guess, you know, in our pockets

213
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,580
to constantly pay attention and go for social validation

214
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,380
for something that's not real.

215
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,980
And insofar as social media is real,

216
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,020
it's not what's really important.

217
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,060
You know, religion has had a tough time.

218
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,580
Religions generally have had a tough time

219
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,180
making the jump to the social media space, right?

220
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,220
Even the, you know, the Pope has a lot of followers

221
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,060
on Twitter, but you don't hear about the Pope

222
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,260
going viral on Twitter, right?

223
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,620
And I think part of it is because religion

224
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:46,260
is fundamentally something that is really deep rooted

225
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,180
in face-to-face interactions.

226
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,020
And social media just doesn't, you know,

227
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,940
it doesn't capture that energy in the same way.

228
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,620
And so social media might be an interesting place

229
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,820
for religious groups to post reminders

230
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,300
or, you know, reaffirmations,

231
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,220
but you don't see a lot of online religions

232
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,140
growing very fast, at least not the way you'd expect.

233
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,460
Do you think it's because that the values

234
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,700
within that social context that you mentioned

235
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,700
is defined by very few people, relatively speaking,

236
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,540
who are also practicing their own kind of a religion?

237
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,660
You know, it is not conventional kind of a religion,

238
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,660
but it's a worldview and a philosophy

239
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,220
that determines this is good, this is bad,

240
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,940
this is right, this is wrong, right?

241
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,340
Because that seems to be the main job of the religion,

242
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,780
which by the way, going back to 9-11,

243
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,300
I grew up as a Muslim in Iran.

244
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,940
I went to school as a Shia Muslim.

245
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,020
So my biggest shock when I moved to the West,

246
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,860
first in Canada and then US,

247
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,820
was how people were treating Islam,

248
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,660
because it was very clear to us

249
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,260
that Islam is inherently a political religion.

250
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,180
It is used for political reason,

251
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,660
because it exists for political reason.

252
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,700
So, you know, all those extremes-

253
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,020
I mean, it was born out of political struggle, right?

254
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,860
Absolutely.

255
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,700
I mean, it's-

256
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,980
The book describes it quite clearly.

257
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,220
It's a book of rules and laws

258
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,620
that includes every single aspect of your life,

259
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,900
including how to govern and how to do all of that.

260
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,500
And it's a very big question

261
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,060
how the true followers of that religion

262
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,980
would ever be able to assimilate to Western society,

263
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,860
because they don't care about the laws that are man-made.

264
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,700
They care about the laws of Allah.

265
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,540
Right.

266
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,300
And this is interesting too,

267
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:42,300
because the separation of religion as a thing, right,

268
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,940
is actually a very new idea.

269
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,500
And it's a very Western idea,

270
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,340
because it's rooted very much

271
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,940
in the idea of a separation of church and state,

272
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,740
which is, you know, not quite even 300 years old yet.

273
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,620
So in the grand scheme of human civilization,

274
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,220
this is like the newest idea that we've had, right,

275
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,020
is to make religion a separate thing.

276
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,500
A lot of cultures throughout the world

277
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,500
don't even have a word for religion.

278
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,580
It's just, that's what they do and what they believe.

279
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,060
It doesn't need a word.

280
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,940
And I think when you look at, you know,

281
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,220
almost any non-Western tradition, but Islam,

282
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,740
definitely being one of them,

283
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,740
the separation of like the secular and the sacred

284
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,660
just doesn't even make sense.

285
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,260
It's just, it's not, it's a non-starter.

286
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,420
That really only exists in the West.

287
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,260
And I think it's something that,

288
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,940
I think it's one of the reasons why the West

289
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,020
has had trouble understanding Islam,

290
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,180
is because, you know, from our perspective, right,

291
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,820
from, you know, the North American perspective, let's say,

292
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,420
or even the European perspective now,

293
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,500
there's very much this idea of like,

294
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,780
well, you know, that's just a religious thing,

295
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,820
but they don't understand that

296
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,740
it's not just a religious thing.

297
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,980
It's actually, it's religion, it's culture.

298
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,820
It's kind of everything about the context.

299
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,900
Exactly, it's a life thing.

300
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,220
And a lot of people don't really understand that,

301
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,380
but it's on the other side of that,

302
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,020
kind of getting back to the comment you made earlier,

303
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,740
one of the things that's interesting about that

304
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,540
is that a lot of times there are people doing things

305
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:25,460
religiously and they don't see how religious they're being

306
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,020
in a secular space.

307
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,940
And social media is exactly this.

308
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:33,580
So myself and two of my friends and researchers

309
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,300
that I work with,

310
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,780
Laurent Schulz and Kevin McAfrey,

311
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:41,220
we studied online behavior on Twitter

312
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,500
using some of the AI systems that I've developed

313
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,900
for analyzing texts on social media

314
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,860
to try and better understand what people's concerns are.

315
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,900
And what we started to find out

316
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:56,420
is that the moral signature of the far left of Twitter

317
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,540
actually mimics the moral signature that experimentally

318
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,940
is usually more common to conservatives,

319
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,260
particularly conservative religious churches.

320
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,420
And it kind of led us to kind of think,

321
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,780
well, maybe this isn't just an anomaly here,

322
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,740
like theoretically, right?

323
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,180
You have a group of people on the very far left of Twitter

324
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,140
who have certain beliefs that cannot be violated.

325
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,260
And if you do violate them, you should basically be

326
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,660
excommunicated from the community.

327
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,860
Yeah, you should be erased, you should be canceled.

328
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,420
But then if somebody tries to critique

329
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,420
your sort of leadership, right?

330
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,340
Your priesthood, then that can't be tolerated.

331
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,620
And generally, you'll just deny that it's happening

332
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,820
in order to resolve the cognitive dissonance.

333
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,540
And if something bad happens within your group,

334
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,220
you're gonna try and push harder to try and say,

335
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,940
well, even though what's happening

336
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,180
is not right ideologically,

337
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,380
if I can get more people to join my group,

338
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,460
then it justifies my beliefs

339
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,700
and it still makes me look like I'm right.

340
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,380
This is the original research for cognitive dissonance,

341
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,020
which happened in a UFO cult, right?

342
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,940
And that exact idea of like, our leadership is failing us,

343
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,260
but if we get more people to join our side,

344
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,500
then it justifies my belief and my identity

345
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,020
of being part of this political party.

346
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,780
I mean, you see that every four years

347
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,300
in the United States now.

348
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,940
It's almost wild to see if it weren't so scary

349
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,460
to see the way that the political parties in the US

350
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:38,460
now basically operate as sort of secular religions.

351
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,180
That is very true, and they don't see it as a religion

352
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,460
at all because they're using religion as,

353
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,060
it's so funny, I was telling somebody that religion

354
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,660
by far leftists are being used the same way that,

355
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,100
for example, Israel and America were being used

356
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:57,100
for Iranian regime to have this ultimate enemy

357
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,660
because of which everything else that you do is justified.

358
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:06,660
So it just feels like the moment that they managed

359
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,300
to remove that in God we trust from back of the money,

360
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,180
it will be replaced immediately by in the state we trust.

361
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,540
And the value and the religion of state is determined

362
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,740
on the basis of very fundamentalist

363
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,060
and uber conservative kind of religious values

364
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,900
that are secular.

365
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:30,900
Yeah, it's interesting to reflect on that too, right?

366
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,260
Because even when you look at the political parties

367
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,180
as religions, it's not just a matter of belief too.

368
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:41,140
Like we have our own rituals, our own secular rituals, right?

369
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,820
Like anyone who looks at the inauguration of a president

370
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,660
can obviously see the ritual that goes there.

371
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,220
When you look at the way that the Senate is,

372
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,580
like the way that the halls are actually set up,

373
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,300
they're set up like churches.

374
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,940
Like all of the people sit in the pew,

375
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,860
the one guy goes to the top pulpit and speaks.

376
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,860
You know, they have like the sort of like, you know,

377
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,500
all of the pomp and circumstance behind them

378
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,340
of whatever altar, whatever sort of structure there is.

379
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,740
And it's, you know, it was deliberately done that way.

380
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,940
I mean, when you go into the,

381
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,020
I think it's the Capitol Rotunda and you look straight up,

382
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,580
it has George Washington being sworn in, right?

383
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,540
And that was done in a very ritualistic way

384
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,700
because they felt it had to be done like a ritual,

385
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,940
but they weren't sure how to do it, right?

386
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,660
So he wore his Freemasons outfit

387
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,060
because there were already,

388
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,420
there's an entire ritual structure to Freemasonry.

389
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,220
And he went, well, I don't have any better ideas.

390
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,100
So everyone that was there was kind of, you know,

391
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,620
they were in Freemasonry as well.

392
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,220
So they just kind of did this Masonic-like ritual

393
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,700
to be part of the inauguration.

394
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,340
The Bible that they swore him in on, if I'm not mistaken,

395
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,820
was actually a Bible from the local

396
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,780
Freemasonry Lodge as well.

397
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,900
And so it kind of reflected this idea

398
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,460
that they needed ritual there.

399
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:02,060
And the, if I'm not mistaken, the title of that work of art

400
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,620
in the Capitol Rotunda is called

401
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,020
the Apotheosis of Washington, right?

402
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,060
Which is, you know, the becoming,

403
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,700
the man becoming God is basically

404
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,300
how you could translate that in Greek, right?

405
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:19,300
And Washington does exist kind of as a quasi deity in a way.

406
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:24,140
And what I find interesting and very frightening

407
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,820
is that in the U.S. now, you know,

408
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:31,020
our founding fathers were always well-respected,

409
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,740
you know, if not kind of quasi-ideified,

410
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,300
at least in a secular sense,

411
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,740
not in a sort of faith or real religion sense.

412
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,580
But now we no longer agree in the United States

413
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,380
that the founding fathers are to be venerated

414
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,900
or are to be even respected.

415
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,980
And in some cases, you know,

416
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,620
we're actively taking down statues of the founding fathers

417
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,420
and people are arguing that even like,

418
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,620
people as important as Abraham Lincoln

419
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,620
should be kind of re-edited into a modern lens.

420
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,340
And I, that is something that's very troubling

421
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:07,340
because when you look at how schisms start in religions,

422
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:12,340
that's one of the main causes is people disagree on,

423
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,200
you know, the role of a founder.

424
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,900
And that is what can make or break,

425
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,860
you know, just about any religion.

426
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,620
And you can even see that in

427
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,220
how Protestantism split from Catholicism.

428
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,340
You can see it also in the Sunni-Shia split historically

429
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,260
as well had to do with, you know, leadership

430
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:36,060
and who had sort of the right lineage at the right times.

431
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,860
You see the same thing in Buddhism as well.

432
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,500
Almost every major religion can,

433
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,120
if there's been a split or if there are multiple branches,

434
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,780
you can trace those multiple branches to an argument

435
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,460
over the lineage and over the founders.

436
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,300
Yeah, I was going to say that bringing down the statues

437
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,140
of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln,

438
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,700
I see literally no difference between that

439
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:00,700
and Taliban exploding the Buddha statues in Bamiyan

440
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,980
because it's about the status quo, it's about the ethos.

441
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,180
And so it makes total sense that the American religion

442
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,660
or American Dharma, as Steve Bannon put it,

443
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,060
is being challenged by the woke Dharma

444
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,980
and the woke religion.

445
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:20,980
Yeah, and in a way, I mean, sadly,

446
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,060
I wish it were more complex and to an extent,

447
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,740
I guess it's more complex than what I'm about to say,

448
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,740
obviously, but heuristically speaking,

449
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,340
it does make sense to kind of say that, you know,

450
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,260
there's the American identity

451
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,220
and then there's the woke identity.

452
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,900
And currently the woke identity is anti-American.

453
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,100
It doesn't stand for American values.

454
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,700
It is, you know, when you look at Antifa protests

455
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,300
and Antifa riots, you know,

456
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,740
they're burning American symbols,

457
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,900
they're spinning, they're burning the American flag

458
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,820
and they're doing that and they know exactly

459
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,540
what they're doing when they do it, right?

460
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,900
They're arguing that, what was it, New York City,

461
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,980
I think it was, just took Thomas Jefferson

462
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,820
out of the city hall.

463
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,900
Yes.

464
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,660
Like these events are symbolic,

465
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:14,500
but they're very real when it comes

466
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,580
to constructing an identity.

467
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,900
And I think one of the ways that you see this

468
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,540
is it starts as a slippery slope

469
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,900
and then it happens quickly.

470
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,260
Historically speaking, when you look at, you know,

471
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,460
moves like this and shifts like this,

472
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,300
it starts slow and then it starts fast

473
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,460
and then it ends fast.

474
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,300
But also you see this, you know,

475
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,980
as part of the slow start, I think,

476
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,900
was getting rid of the Pledge of Allegiance in schools.

477
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,540
I think that that's one of those things, you know,

478
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,180
I had a very good friend growing up

479
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,220
who was a Jehovah's Witness

480
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,660
and he claimed a religious exemption

481
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,420
and he wouldn't stand for the pledge.

482
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,260
And I don't have any problem with that.

483
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,020
If that's a religious exemption, that's fine.

484
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,660
But as a society, you know, the bulk of us,

485
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,220
the most of us should have something that we do

486
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:01,780
that repeats and reaffirms our identity as a people.

487
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,980
And every people should have that, right?

488
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,060
Because it helps them to create their identity.

489
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,940
And people who have stronger identities

490
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,340
are generally happier, right?

491
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,740
If, you know, you get into a situation and times are tough,

492
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,660
you know that you have people in your group

493
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,180
that can help you out.

494
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,940
You know, you have common experiences, common beliefs

495
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,980
and the reaffirmation of something like this,

496
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,260
the Pledge of Allegiance,

497
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,500
very much functioned to do that psychologically

498
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,700
for a very long time, even though, you know,

499
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,140
we did change the Pledge of Allegiance

500
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,380
at a certain point, right?

501
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,460
And added in God we trust on our currency at a certain point

502
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,100
to reflect that our identity was different

503
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,860
than the rise in the communist identity during the Cold War.

504
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,860
So it had its particular function, historically speaking.

505
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,340
But at the same time, you know, we can change those words.

506
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,300
What's important is that those words reflect core values,

507
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,620
though, and that they're repeated often enough

508
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,100
that we all know where we all stand.

509
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,460
Yeah, a common big picture to strive towards,

510
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,060
to give meaning to this experience that you're having,

511
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,700
you know, otherwise, what's the difference of being anywhere?

512
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,300
You know, it's- Exactly, exactly.

513
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:16,780
And you see this in some of the thought leadership

514
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:20,300
on the woke side of the United States right now,

515
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,500
where in the past, you know, free markets,

516
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,300
freedom of expression, you know, free speech,

517
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,540
these were certain rights that were just fundamental

518
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,260
to the American belief, you know,

519
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,060
we can disagree on different things, you know,

520
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,580
we don't have to be the same religion

521
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,060
or like the same kind of drinks,

522
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,780
or even drinker, drink beer, not drink beer,

523
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,900
or whatever it is, those are just details.

524
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,420
Even vote Republican or Democrat or third party,

525
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,580
those were kind of details,

526
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,580
because we all agree things like free speech,

527
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:54,020
freedom of association, you know, a free press,

528
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,660
like, you know, help, and then little things too,

529
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,020
like helping your neighbor, right?

530
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,940
You know, being someone that you can rely on,

531
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,620
respecting your elders, giving up your seat on the bus

532
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,180
when somebody needs it, like,

533
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,020
there were these little cultural things

534
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,340
that kind of built up, you know,

535
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:14,340
who Americans were as an identity and as a people.

536
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,540
And those things, a lot of them have come

537
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,900
under attack quite directly, you know,

538
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,740
some of the woke leadership, you know,

539
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,860
I was watching an interview on Democracy Now,

540
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:31,380
not that long ago, with Ibram X. Kendi,

541
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,660
who was at Boston University at the same time I was,

542
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:38,020
actually, or he still is there.

543
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,740
And he mentioned that to be anti-racist, right?

544
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:45,780
Which was his, like, neologism to try

545
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,460
and kind of create a mental gymnastics leap.

546
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,300
For racism.

547
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,820
In his books, yeah, for racism, right?

548
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,300
It's basically to be anti-racist is to be racist,

549
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,700
but a different kind.

550
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,700
And it's a kind that he thinks is a good kind of racism,

551
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,020
which boggles my mind, right?

552
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,220
When I was at Boston University,

553
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,860
my office was in the School of Religion and Theology,

554
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,340
which is the school that granted Dr. Martin Luther King

555
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,540
his doctorate.

556
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,340
And at that same university now,

557
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,700
there is a man who is perpetuating racism

558
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,100
under the guise of equity and inclusion,

559
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,420
and just kind of spinning on the greatest speeches

560
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,020
and teachings that Martin Luther King

561
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,740
ever gave the United States.

562
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,580
And that just blew my mind.

563
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:31,460
It made me very uncomfortable to be there at the university.

564
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:34,540
And it made a lot of the students uncomfortable as well.

565
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,300
I got very close with some of the students

566
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:40,260
who were not okay with the woke direction

567
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,540
the university was going with.

568
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,900
One of them is Joe Allen,

569
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,740
who's now a correspondent for Steve Bannon on The War Room.

570
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,940
Joe's still a good friend of mine to this day, actually.

571
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,460
We disagree about a lot of stuff,

572
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,740
but we respect each other.

573
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,140
We know that at the end of the day,

574
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,860
we have those core values, right?

575
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:00,660
So when he and I go back and forth on AI and transhumanism,

576
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,940
we really get arguing,

577
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,460
but we do it out of a place of respect.

578
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,340
And at the end of it, we both know

579
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:10,300
that we're still gonna have a cheers of our beer

580
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,860
at the end of the conversation,

581
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,380
and everything's gonna be fine,

582
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,140
because we know that those fundamental core values are there,

583
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,060
and those are the guiding lights.

584
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,380
The debates are just how we kind of take turns

585
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,220
to right the ship as we move forward.

586
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,220
But I think we can't have progress

587
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,300
without those fundamental values being there.

588
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,940
Ibram X. Kendi on Democracy Now recently said

589
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:33,460
that to be anti-racist is to be anti-capitalist.

590
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:36,420
And the repercussions of that,

591
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,580
particularly in light of the leadership

592
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,060
of the Black Lives Matter movement,

593
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,780
saying that they have an ideology,

594
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,660
and they are trained Marxists,

595
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,700
and the relationship between wokeism

596
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:53,020
and social justice warrior terms and neo-Marxist terms,

597
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:53,940
being very clear.

598
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,300
And we've spelled this out actually in research

599
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,900
that we've published online as well,

600
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,580
showing not only using an analysis of Google Books,

601
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,740
which is the largest corpus that's digitized

602
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,580
in the history of humankind,

603
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:10,100
we also were following Twitter conversations online.

604
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,820
And we were finding that you do still see this relationship

605
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,060
between the sort of like neo-Marxist ideology

606
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,460
and the social justice worship,

607
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,380
taking off slowly from the 80s,

608
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,940
and then really propelling exponentially

609
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,900
into the 2000s.

610
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,820
And these things are all related.

611
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,460
And I think that's what's really defining

612
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,460
the rhetoric of the left.

613
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,900
And it worries me because that's the dominant rhetoric

614
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,500
on social media.

615
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,060
And ideally social media is a place for all of us to speak

616
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:42,380
and for all of us to kind of have our discussions,

617
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,820
even if we disagree.

618
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:47,940
But what we're seeing now is a partitioning of social media,

619
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,340
or what we've seen recently is a partitioning

620
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,300
of social media, of the Twitter and the Facebooks,

621
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,820
and then your alternatives, right?

622
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:00,420
Like Minds, Getter, Parler, and the other.

623
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:04,620
And I don't, I mean, I support those

624
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,980
alternative social media sites.

625
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,140
I have accounts on most of them,

626
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,740
and I use them of different levels.

627
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,740
I use them all more than I use Facebook

628
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,180
and more than I use Twitter.

629
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,540
But I think that we need to have a common dialogue.

630
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:20,540
And Reddit has a lot of different people there.

631
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,460
It has a lot of diversity of thought.

632
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,940
But it also has a censorship issue, in my opinion.

633
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,380
They're too quick to censor.

634
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:32,180
So we're at the point that our digital and our analog,

635
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,820
online and offline lives are suffering,

636
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:39,260
if we wanna use that term, from the same kind of gridlocks,

637
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,860
that they all go back to monopolization

638
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,420
of values and ideas.

639
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,620
Would that be fair to say?

640
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,220
Yeah, I would say that like, yeah, the monopolization

641
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,980
of values and ideas is really unhealthy socially.

642
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,100
And social media kind of, I mean, the foundation

643
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,500
of it offline has existed for a little while,

644
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,260
but it was kind of, you know, it was a little bit here

645
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,260
and there in the media.

646
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:06,700
But now, recently, it has been just, you know,

647
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,380
it hits us over the head every day.

648
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,300
One of the things that we found in our research,

649
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,780
and I gave a talk about this recently,

650
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:16,340
the talk's actually on YouTube, in Cyprus,

651
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,340
at the Reflect Festival in October,

652
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,300
I presented some interesting research that shows

653
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,740
that when you look at crime rates in America

654
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,060
and perceived crime rates in America,

655
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,380
so the actual crime rates,

656
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,260
and then how people think the crime rates going,

657
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,580
they basically, like, they have data going back

658
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,220
to like the eighties and the nineties.

659
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,020
And so it basically kind of keeps going down

660
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,180
and down and down, and it's true,

661
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,060
both the crime rate was going down,

662
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,140
it's been going down for decades

663
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,220
when you look at the general trend.

664
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,780
But it goes down and then all of a sudden,

665
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,900
there's a divergence,

666
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,100
where the crime rate keeps going down,

667
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,620
but the perceived crime rate starts to go up.

668
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,820
And when you look at when this divergence happens,

669
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:01,020
the divergence keeps getting greater and greater and greater

670
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,820
between actual crime rates and perceived crime rates

671
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,060
as adoption of broadband internet

672
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,260
in the United States starts to go up,

673
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,060
and the rise of social media usage

674
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,140
starts to go up in the United States.

675
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,580
That's one of the things where it's just a very clear tale

676
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,780
of that constant media stream

677
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,940
with algorithms that are perpetuating

678
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:26,940
and promoting the most sensational news, right?

679
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,780
Which is typically violence or instability

680
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,540
or riots or robberies.

681
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,220
These are the things that are gonna get promoted

682
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,380
by these algorithms,

683
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,260
because those are the things

684
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,860
that are gonna get the most engagement

685
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,540
and it's gonna get the most people talking.

686
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,580
And we've suffered in the real world,

687
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,500
psychologically because of it.

688
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,100
And I think that was a very large part

689
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,940
in setting up the context and the motivation

690
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,300
for the riots that we saw in 2000,

691
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,980
where a lot of people were frustrated,

692
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,380
some justifiably so,

693
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:02,140
and some were just there because they perceived the world

694
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,220
in a way that wasn't true.

695
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,020
You mean 2020?

696
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, 2020.

697
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,380
You know, in 2020 and to an extent, I guess 2021,

698
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,420
but it's really kind of died down recently.

699
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:18,420
But in 2020, there was a lot of anger

700
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:21,980
and it was very much being promoted by social media

701
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,860
and the actual media.

702
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:27,860
I mean, generally I try and follow both sides of the media

703
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,980
to kind of get a sense of what's going on.

704
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,060
And then I have a few sources that I really like

705
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,900
because I think they start from a place of balance.

706
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,060
And then I have a couple that I like

707
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,500
just because they're keeping people in line.

708
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,620
Project Veritas, for example, is one of them.

709
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,100
I follow Project Veritas

710
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,300
and sometimes I don't like the way they frame things

711
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,820
here and there, but on the whole,

712
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:50,900
I think that he is doing really good work

713
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,940
in exposing a lot of nonsense.

714
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:56,180
And one of the things that was exposed by Project Veritas

715
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,740
was one of the CNN producers.

716
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,900
You know, and he literally said, if it bleeds, it leads.

717
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,980
And they had the coronavirus infection and body count

718
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,820
going all the way through the election.

719
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,940
And then after the election, it just went away.

720
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,660
The virus didn't go away,

721
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:15,620
but all of a sudden the media coverage went away.

722
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,700
And now they're caught in between this,

723
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,540
like want to basically propagandize

724
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,900
for the Biden administration at CNN

725
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,020
and make it look like everything's going well

726
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,580
and he's solving the coronavirus problem,

727
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,180
but also kind of push their narrative

728
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,980
that the coronavirus problem is, you know,

729
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,260
getting out of hand and that they need more lockdowns.

730
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,140
And so they're really kind of caught

731
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,020
in an almost Orwellian doublespeak.

732
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:43,860
It's like, it's almost like watching 1984 unfold,

733
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:47,140
like it was written as a handbook instead of a fiction.

734
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:51,140
Yeah, so I think a lot of those approaches like,

735
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:54,780
how can you be that stupid to say fiery, but mostly peaceful?

736
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,300
You know, like, you know.

737
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,140
Right?

738
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:00,820
It's like, are you, you cannot possibly be that stupid.

739
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:04,500
So there is a reason, there is an intention behind,

740
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,060
you know, kind of nudging things to the direction

741
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:11,340
that they want to be led towards their bigger narrative,

742
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:16,260
which goes back to monopolization of values and ideals

743
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:19,500
that are being practiced in a very religious kind of a way.

744
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:24,020
Now, I want to say that all of this has hyped up perhaps

745
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,820
because of use of computers and use of internet

746
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,340
and more recently use of artificial intelligence

747
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,340
and machine learning, use of modern technology basically,

748
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:37,300
which is evolving exponentially while we're experiencing

749
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,100
in a very linear kind of a fashion.

750
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,300
So that's why maybe it seems like everything

751
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,780
is getting out of control.

752
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,940
But the problem is that these AI systems

753
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,820
that are now being built and monopolized

754
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,140
by a lot of these people,

755
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:51,940
they are following the same kind of monopolization

756
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,300
of values and ideals and objectives and goals,

757
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,900
because the same people who have caused these problems,

758
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,380
you know, right now in this world,

759
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,860
they're behind developing these systems

760
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:05,740
that they can later on use for like a social credit system

761
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,460
and, you know, on and on and on.

762
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,420
Yeah.

763
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,980
I mean, the idea of implementation

764
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,820
of a social credit system is one of the,

765
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,140
in my mind is one of the scariest things

766
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,580
in the AI debate right now.

767
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,940
A lot of AI honestly is useless and unimpressive.

768
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,980
And when you look at really what's being developed out there,

769
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,700
a lot of it's not that interesting.

770
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,860
A lot of it's nonsense.

771
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,420
A lot of it's like, you know,

772
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,860
make your face look like a turtle.

773
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,380
It's just stupid stuff.

774
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:36,380
But there's certain ideas that are being implemented in,

775
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:40,300
you know, for example, in China, the social credit system,

776
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:44,340
it should be the biggest wake-up call

777
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:49,340
to the West generally that has existed since the 1930s.

778
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,060
And I don't see any other way around it.

779
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,460
And I mean, I almost, you know,

780
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,740
I don't want to come off as hyperbolic,

781
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,140
but when you look at what's going on there in China,

782
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,180
when it comes to the social credit score,

783
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,860
when it comes to, you know,

784
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:11,100
the concentration camps that they have in Xinjiang,

785
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,100
when it comes to the way they're manipulating the media,

786
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,860
the way they treated the COVID lockdowns

787
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,660
by just welding the doors shut

788
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,100
and just helping people fend for themselves

789
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,820
and then acting like it didn't happen.

790
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,660
And then, you know,

791
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,860
not even to necessarily go down the rabbit hole

792
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,740
that is the lab leak,

793
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,980
but it's just, you look at that and you look at China today

794
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,260
and the way that it's utilizing like child labor in Africa

795
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,660
to monopolize things like

796
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,460
critical rare earth materials and stuff.

797
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:39,060
It's just, there's nothing going on there

798
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:43,620
that suggests that this is a peaceful interaction

799
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,740
that we're going to continue to have.

800
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:49,860
Everything suggests that this is a Cold War scenario

801
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,940
led by a World War II level dictatorship.

802
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,580
Perhaps more dangerous because Nazis could even dream

803
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:00,540
of, you know, having this level of technology,

804
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,540
this level of tool.

805
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,980
Yeah, I mean, Nazis didn't have the bomb, right?

806
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:08,740
And China does, you know, they didn't have AI.

807
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,580
When it, you know,

808
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,900
they had to go around and check on people's papers

809
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,260
and they were just looking at people to kind of, you know,

810
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,540
see, oh, do you have your papers?

811
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,300
Are you the right, do you go to a synagogue?

812
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,060
You know, what religion do you have?

813
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:19,940
What's your last name?

814
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,860
How do you spell it?

815
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,460
You know, do you speak Yiddish?

816
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,620
They were looking at these things

817
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,580
and they were looking for that.

818
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,180
They were looking for all sorts of people, right?

819
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,460
They were looking for the Roma, for the gypsies as well.

820
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:34,980
And, you know, the gypsies typically have a darker skin tone

821
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,860
in this part of Europe.

822
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,020
So a lot of times they were easy to spot and round up.

823
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:43,420
But in looking at what China's doing,

824
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,660
I mean, they are using AI

825
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,700
and there are patents that have come forward

826
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,380
that say we can identify Uyghur Muslims.

827
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,300
And then they act like, oh, no, no, well, that's,

828
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,740
we didn't really say that.

829
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,860
And it's like, we saw, you said that.

830
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:59,380
This is obviously happening.

831
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,260
And these systems are being put into place

832
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,180
where you can just round people up using AI

833
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,540
for saying the wrong thing, for looking the wrong way,

834
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,420
for having the wrong belief.

835
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,060
And I mean, ultimately they're doing to the Uyghurs

836
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,260
what they wished they could have done

837
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,620
to the Tibetans before that.

838
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,140
And it's only a matter of time

839
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,540
before they find someone outside of their border

840
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,780
that's standing in the way of the regime's dominance

841
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,100
of the CCP and they're gonna target them too.

842
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,740
That's the scariest thing, I think.

843
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:33,100
They already installed automated robots

844
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,940
at the border with India

845
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:38,660
that they're automatically shooting at Indian soldiers.

846
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,500
So they're using-

847
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,900
I've read reports of this.

848
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,180
They're using all the tools at their disposal

849
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,180
for the objective that they have,

850
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,100
this bigger picture that they have,

851
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,940
point of alignment that is defined by the Communist Party.

852
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,700
And I think this is a point of difference

853
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,020
between me and someone like Joe Allen,

854
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,500
who I had about two hour long conversation

855
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,620
with him on the phone, mostly about AI, I think.

856
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:02,900
He told me he had a long conversation with you on AI.

857
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,020
And I enjoyed it.

858
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,380
I actually approached him and said,

859
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,860
dude, you're doing a very good job

860
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,180
because these kinds of stuff,

861
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,620
I've talked with a lot of people during this podcast

862
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,500
that politicians aren't even talking about it.

863
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,940
And these are the most consequential things

864
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,980
that are happening.

865
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:21,340
And the most valid answer I got is that politicians

866
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,500
aren't talking about it because this is not a worry

867
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,620
of their constituents.

868
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:27,300
Constituents don't even know these things exist

869
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,900
and these things are happening,

870
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,100
which brings an entire issue with

871
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,060
how are we dealing with democracy as a system of governance

872
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:37,580
when you have a centrally driven monster and dragon

873
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,860
like China on the other side of the equation.

874
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:44,100
But my point is that we cannot get rid of tools

875
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,300
to defeat tools.

876
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,180
We need to use the tools based on our intention

877
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,260
and our own values and perspective

878
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,180
in order to defeat enemy,

879
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:56,580
whoever you wanna call it that are using very freely

880
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,580
and openly whatever kind of tool that is available to them.

881
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,300
And I think this is a point that I take part

882
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,100
with a lot of people on the right

883
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,060
who are saying, no, all this technology,

884
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,860
the modern technology, AI and all that,

885
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:10,060
they're demonic, they're evil, they're satanic.

886
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,500
We shouldn't be using them at all.

887
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,860
They're like, well, you're not gonna survive them.

888
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:17,740
Yeah, it's funny, cause actually I feel like,

889
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,020
not to talk about Joe when he's not here,

890
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,860
but I feel like Joe kind of struggles with that too.

891
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,540
Cause when he and I talk about that,

892
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,460
he has this kind of tonality to it as if it's like,

893
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:28,580
this is like a struggle against sort of like,

894
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:31,740
you know, this almost like demonic technology.

895
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,300
And I don't view it that way at all actually.

896
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,700
I'm very pro technology.

897
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,580
I do think it's a tool

898
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,580
and I think it's a tool that we can use, right?

899
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,260
And so we've been working,

900
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:45,540
so my company has been working with minds.com.

901
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,460
We started a project about,

902
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,140
I guess it's about a year ago now,

903
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:53,820
where they basically,

904
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:57,460
they read a paper that we did on simulating censorship.

905
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:00,060
And basically our conclusion based on running

906
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,940
20,000 different simulations

907
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,620
of how individuals interact on social networks,

908
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,740
that centralized censorship

909
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,780
actually increases radicalization.

910
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:12,780
And that allowing people

911
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,100
to just choose with whom they interact

912
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,980
and saying, ah, you know, that guy,

913
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:20,700
he's being a dick, I'm gonna block him.

914
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,340
And so you just block him

915
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:25,820
instead of having Facebook come in and remove him entirely,

916
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:30,020
that centralized censorship increases radicalization,

917
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,900
but the one-to-one censorship

918
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:35,100
doesn't have the same sort of effect.

919
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,580
So I was speaking with the guys at minds.com

920
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:41,380
and they're committed to not censoring, right?

921
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,500
Unless it's illegal, they won't censor it.

922
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,420
If it's not safe for work,

923
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,940
they ask you to tag it so you can blur it

924
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,060
so that if you're using minds.com at work,

925
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,900
you don't have something pornographic

926
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,380
scroll up your feed, for example,

927
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:59,620
like they don't block pornography, right?

928
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,460
It's legal, it can stay on the site.

929
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:06,420
Just respect others who might be checking this at work

930
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,220
and blur it out for them is what they ask.

931
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,020
And so I really like that approach.

932
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,060
I really support that approach.

933
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,540
I think it aligns with free speech values.

934
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:18,220
So the question then is how can we also make sure though

935
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:21,820
that radicalization and hatred don't breed on that site?

936
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,860
And on the one hand, not censoring already helps,

937
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,100
but on the other hand,

938
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:31,420
what causes radicalization is not using the internet, right?

939
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,860
There's been tons of studies on this

940
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,980
and none of them have really shown

941
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,260
that internet use is a strong predictor

942
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,460
of radicalization or extremism.

943
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:43,020
What is a predictor are real life experiences.

944
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,500
And what seems to be happening,

945
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,420
particularly with people who are like,

946
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,540
for example, if they're white supremacists

947
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,620
and they are to the point of extremism

948
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:55,060
where they may commit violence

949
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:58,860
against another racial community.

950
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:02,340
What typically has happened is that their understanding

951
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:05,300
of that racial community just is not realistic at all.

952
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,820
And it's usually because of isolation, right?

953
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,620
They've never actually spoken to someone of another race

954
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,500
or had to interact with them.

955
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,620
And so it allows them to breed hatred.

956
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,860
And I think that's why guys like Daryl Davis

957
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,140
have been so effective in de-radicalization.

958
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,220
Daryl Davis is part of the project with us actually.

959
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,580
Oh, awesome.

960
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,180
Yeah, yeah, he's been great to work with.

961
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,940
So we were working with Daryl Davis

962
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:31,780
and the late Jesse Morton was also part of this with us.

963
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:35,780
And we have Bill Ottman, the CEO at Mines

964
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,060
is working with us directly on it,

965
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:41,180
as is Jack, the COO at Mines.

966
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:44,020
So it's been a really fun, a really cool project

967
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:47,060
where we've brought in all kinds of experts globally

968
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,340
on radicalization and said,

969
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,180
look, what are your proposals?

970
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,980
And we hear them out and we just tell them like,

971
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,940
censorship is non-negotiable.

972
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,700
That's not on the table for us.

973
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,180
Like we're gonna figure out

974
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,540
how to address radicalization and extremism,

975
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:04,020
but we're not gonna sacrifice these core values.

976
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,220
And that's been a really interesting project

977
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,860
because everyone's response in social media is,

978
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,260
just ban them, just get rid of them.

979
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,220
And the issue is that that doesn't solve the problem.

980
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:16,140
That just makes it so that you don't see the problem.

981
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,460
And that's a very different solution.

982
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:20,460
Yeah, out of sight, out of mind, they think,

983
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:24,180
but it'll always come back harder and more extreme.

984
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,900
Like you can't get rid of the information.

985
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,060
Yeah, like one of the things that boggled my mind

986
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:35,060
was the general media response to like,

987
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:39,340
what was going on in 2020 and even all the way up

988
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:43,340
to like the January 6 protests and everything.

989
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:46,580
It's like, people were so surprised.

990
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:49,700
And I was like, why are you surprised by this?

991
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,620
You're just not listening.

992
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:54,380
If you're surprised, you're just not listening.

993
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,260
And I think part of it, and one of the reasons

994
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,500
why I think the January 6 protest

995
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,820
was so surprising to people

996
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:02,220
is because those were the kinds of voices

997
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:05,460
that have been algorithmically silenced.

998
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:09,380
And so people didn't realize how widespread,

999
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:15,300
not QAnon, not any particular conspiracy theory,

1000
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:20,340
but how widespread frustration with the government system

1001
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,620
leading into the election

1002
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:24,620
and then frustration with the election.

1003
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,740
And the idea that they did not have a voice heard

1004
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:32,300
in the justice system, that was suppressed online.

1005
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:36,740
So nobody saw it coming when it instantiated itself

1006
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,340
the way that it did on January 6.

1007
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:41,740
And that I find very interesting.

1008
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:44,540
Then the media of course has now used this as like impetus

1009
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:47,460
for domestic terrorist reform,

1010
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:50,460
the likes of which we've not seen since 9-11.

1011
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:55,460
And that I find very confusing

1012
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:59,900
from a legal perspective, from a policy perspective.

1013
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:04,900
Because while I agree if a group tries to take over

1014
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:08,380
the Senate during a proceeding,

1015
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:11,060
that is just by letter of the law.

1016
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:15,020
And you look at how the FBI defines what terrorism is,

1017
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:18,820
is basically any sort of use or threat of violence

1018
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:21,380
in order to achieve a political end.

1019
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:22,860
It's a very vague definition,

1020
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,860
maybe problematically vague actually.

1021
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:27,100
But if we take that definition,

1022
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,500
I can see how you could apply that definition

1023
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:34,500
to a small subset of the people present on January 6.

1024
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:38,140
However, if you apply it to January 6,

1025
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:42,500
but you don't apply it to Antifa in 2020,

1026
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,140
it makes me question the extent to which

1027
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:47,780
this is entirely politically motivated.

1028
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:48,620
It is entirely politically motivated.

1029
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,540
And not really about its security.

1030
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,980
Yeah, and that's the conclusion that I've come to.

1031
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:55,060
And I think that most logical people will come to

1032
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,860
as we say, look, here's our measuring stick.

1033
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:00,180
If it fits in this box, we get to call it terrorism.

1034
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,300
And they throw January 6, and basically people go,

1035
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,980
everyone, and some people say everyone.

1036
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,220
And then I go, you're not looking

1037
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:08,260
at what they were doing there.

1038
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,940
And then they go, some of them.

1039
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:12,180
And I go, okay, some of them,

1040
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,060
I can see how this fits the definition, yes.

1041
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:18,020
And then I would say, okay, insurrections, Antifa, right?

1042
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,500
What about Chavez, right?

1043
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,540
They declared an independent nation

1044
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:26,020
within the United States, and they took over a courthouse,

1045
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,820
which sounds familiar, right?

1046
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,540
They took over a government building,

1047
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,780
declared an independent nation,

1048
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:36,180
and then guarded it with arms for like a month.

1049
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:39,020
But that wasn't an insurrection or terrorism.

1050
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:42,940
And it just makes me really worried

1051
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:45,580
because the key to stability in a democracy

1052
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:47,700
is an independent judiciary.

1053
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,700
And if we don't have an independent judiciary

1054
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:53,820
in the United States, effectively you have regulation

1055
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:57,060
and legislation by the executive, right?

1056
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:58,260
By enforcement.

1057
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:01,340
The law is what the person at the top says what the law is.

1058
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,500
And in the US, that person at the top

1059
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,820
can change every four years.

1060
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:07,340
That doesn't make for a stable society.

1061
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:09,580
It doesn't make for stable investments.

1062
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:10,740
Like, how can you plan a business

1063
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:11,780
if you don't know if your business

1064
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:13,740
will be legal in four years, right?

1065
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,220
And I think the marijuana industry has seen this

1066
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:17,220
in particular, right?

1067
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:22,220
Those guys have struggled, not just socioculturally

1068
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,900
about acceptance or not acceptance

1069
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:27,980
or the morality of using or not using marijuana,

1070
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:30,020
but just legally speaking,

1071
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:33,020
those guys don't know whether they're coming or going.

1072
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:33,860
Yeah.

1073
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:36,460
Cryptocurrency also is the same way right now.

1074
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:39,820
Cryptocurrency, which is probably the largest opportunity

1075
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:42,340
and it's probably the biggest wealth transfer

1076
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:46,500
to like the little guy that we've ever seen.

1077
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:50,780
When you look at how many guys got into cryptocurrency

1078
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:53,180
before banks, well, banks were still saying

1079
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:55,220
that it's nonsense and it's a Ponzi scheme

1080
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:56,500
and all this other stuff.

1081
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,140
Guys were buying Bitcoin.

1082
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,060
And a lot of these guys are just little guys

1083
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,460
who now can afford apartments

1084
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:03,060
that they never could have afforded

1085
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,860
because they invested in Bitcoin

1086
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:07,780
when Bitcoin was at like, you know, four or 500,

1087
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:09,380
maybe it was at a thousand or 2000.

1088
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:11,740
And now it's sitting at $40,000

1089
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:15,420
and they've outperformed the best hedge funds on Wall Street.

1090
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,380
And now of course the SEC wants to come in

1091
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:19,260
and act like they have the authority to regulate.

1092
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,500
It's not clear that they do,

1093
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,260
but they're gonna regulate by enforcement

1094
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:24,380
and they're gonna say, well,

1095
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,540
we're gonna take you to court.

1096
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:28,020
We're gonna sue you and ruin your life and your company.

1097
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:31,260
And then we'll see whether or not you broke the law.

1098
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:32,940
And that's not rule of law.

1099
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:33,780
That's not healthy.

1100
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:36,540
That's, you know, what a dictatorship does.

1101
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:37,580
Yeah, at the same time,

1102
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:39,420
there are people who are running right now

1103
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,820
for Senate, Josh Mandel in Ohio

1104
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:44,340
and Blake Masters in Arizona.

1105
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:48,260
They already called for Fort Satoshi Nakamoto

1106
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:51,700
as a new Fort Knox for United States government

1107
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,380
to hold Bitcoin.

1108
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:56,740
And you know, this contrast I think exists

1109
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:59,100
exactly because there was a power struggle

1110
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:01,420
for a vacuum that hasn't been created

1111
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:05,460
as a result of four years of maybe five years of Trump,

1112
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:07,700
who I consider to be a psychedelic.

1113
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,060
Trump was a psychedelic.

1114
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:10,300
You know, it's like.

1115
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,140
I like that.

1116
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:15,460
The entire world tripped on Trump really hard.

1117
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:18,060
And some people have been having very bad trips

1118
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:20,980
because their entire identity and worldview was shattered.

1119
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:23,420
That how is this even possible?

1120
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:24,380
I like that.

1121
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:25,820
I've not thought of it that way before,

1122
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,180
but I really like that.

1123
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,020
Trump was a trip.

1124
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,020
He really was like a psychedelic.

1125
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:32,780
Cause in a way you were like, is this real?

1126
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:36,060
There's aspects of reality to some of these things.

1127
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:37,620
And then some of these things, I don't know.

1128
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:39,780
Some of it was, some of his behavior,

1129
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:42,380
I personally found kind of bizarre.

1130
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,220
So I guess.

1131
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:45,980
He also revealed that it doesn't really matter

1132
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:47,260
who's elected president.

1133
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:51,220
There is a class in DC, which I have a friend.

1134
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:52,900
He's a White House correspondent.

1135
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,940
He's saying DC is not even America.

1136
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:57,380
You know, it's like an occupied zone basically

1137
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:00,460
by people whose interests is not shared

1138
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,300
with absolute majority of American people.

1139
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,980
And they've taken over this country.

1140
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:06,340
So absolutely it has everything they're doing.

1141
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:10,380
It has political incentive and political implication,

1142
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,060
but I think they've overreached.

1143
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:16,620
And that's like a silver lining in all of this to me,

1144
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:18,540
that they just gone overboard.

1145
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:23,540
That's why they're becoming very overtly coercive

1146
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:25,780
and violent.

1147
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,500
And it's just not sustainable, you know,

1148
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,620
because United States is not North Korea.

1149
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:31,940
Exactly.

1150
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:34,900
And one of the things that a lot of the work

1151
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:38,060
that I've done in the AI space has allowed me to do

1152
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:43,060
is kind of investigate what causes things to go wrong, right?

1153
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:45,820
What happens when you overly centralize an identity,

1154
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:48,540
when you overly centralize power,

1155
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:51,620
or what happens when you make it like super distributed?

1156
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:55,780
And one of the patterns that we've seen in this research

1157
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:58,700
is that when you overly centralized power

1158
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:01,100
or you overly centralized the culture,

1159
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:06,100
like the cultural permissibility, you end up breaking

1160
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:07,500
the system.

1161
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,660
And the fact of the matter is just that, you know,

1162
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:13,020
humans are different, like we're all different.

1163
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:16,220
And that's the cool thing about us actually.

1164
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:18,460
It's what I love the most is, you know,

1165
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:19,980
when I talk to somebody,

1166
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:22,100
you don't know what's gonna happen, right?

1167
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,100
They could be end up being your best friend,

1168
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,180
or you could just be like,

1169
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:27,580
I didn't like that guy at all, right?

1170
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:30,820
And it's just, that's our beauty.

1171
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,540
And that's our curse, right?

1172
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:34,820
Because sometimes we're too different to get along.

1173
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:37,620
And other times we're just different enough to cooperate,

1174
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:39,740
but we're not gonna be friends, but we'll be colleagues,

1175
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:42,420
like, you know, and everything in between.

1176
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:44,940
And when you overly centralized power

1177
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,340
to people of a specific kind of belief

1178
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:50,060
or a specific kind of background,

1179
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:52,300
you're always going to neglect the people

1180
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,700
that are towards the extremity

1181
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,820
of wherever you sit on that spectrum.

1182
00:51:56,820 --> 00:52:00,460
And so that is never going to create stability

1183
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,140
because eventually everyone else

1184
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:04,140
is gonna start teaming up on you,

1185
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:06,780
and you're going to effectively be an imperialist

1186
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:08,380
within your own country.

1187
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:09,820
And this happens whenever you see

1188
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:11,980
the centralization of power, right?

1189
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:15,900
Every single major historical example

1190
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:19,700
of a complex society that has collapsed,

1191
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,780
has collapsed effectively

1192
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:26,780
because it overly centralized economic decision-making

1193
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:30,620
and overly pushed that to deal with problems

1194
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,780
that it itself was creating.

1195
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:35,620
So like, for example, in this,

1196
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:36,940
you can actually read the guy

1197
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:39,180
with Cambridge University Press actually published a book

1198
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,740
called The Complex of Complexes,

1199
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,980
or The Collapse of Complex Societies.

1200
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,220
His name's Joseph Tainter.

1201
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,620
He's a professor at Utah.

1202
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:50,180
He surveyed over 20 different complex societies

1203
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:52,180
and basically found that what happens

1204
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:56,540
is when a society makes an investment into something,

1205
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,380
some problem that it has,

1206
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:02,220
there's an effect of declining marginal returns

1207
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,260
in the economic sense.

1208
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,100
And basically what that means is that

1209
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,380
when you put a dollar in the first time,

1210
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,100
you get a dollar out.

1211
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:11,300
But when you put a dollar in the second time,

1212
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:14,180
you only get like 98 cents back out.

1213
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:15,900
And then when you put a dollar in again,

1214
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,660
maybe you only get 90 cents out.

1215
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:20,340
And the more money you put into these problems,

1216
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:23,540
the less value you actually get out of it.

1217
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:25,700
And at a certain point,

1218
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:29,140
society, you start putting money into problems

1219
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:32,460
that the problem solvers have created.

1220
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:33,780
And when you get to the point

1221
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:35,460
where you're putting resources,

1222
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:38,180
if it's wood in the Roman Empire,

1223
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:41,060
if it's olive trees in the Greek Empire,

1224
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:43,140
like the Greek Empire was built without wood.

1225
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,500
Like a lot of people don't realize

1226
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:47,020
how much wood does not grow in Greece.

1227
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:50,740
So because of that, like they had to rely on trade.

1228
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:52,980
So when they were investing in social problems,

1229
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:55,660
there was a very clear declining marginal return, right?

1230
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:57,820
This works in barter systems.

1231
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:58,980
It works for gold.

1232
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:01,620
It happened to the Mayas and the Incas.

1233
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:04,060
And to an extent, I think we can look at this

1234
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:06,220
also happening in the United States today.

1235
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:08,780
And that's one of the biggest worries that I see.

1236
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:11,020
It happened in the Soviet Union, right?

1237
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:14,100
But at the point in which your government is saying,

1238
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,220
oh, this is a problem, I can fix it.

1239
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:17,060
I need some money.

1240
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:18,740
And we go, okay, here's some money and they fix it.

1241
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:21,580
But then later, their fix created a problem

1242
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:23,900
that they then need more money to fix.

1243
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,180
We can start to see how our returns

1244
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,660
on our tax money investment

1245
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:29,780
are getting lower and lower and lower.

1246
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:32,580
And with a US national debt that gets so high

1247
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:35,980
that it's interest payments alone

1248
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:39,540
are no longer able to be paid, much less the principle.

1249
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:41,140
You start to see how we start to get

1250
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:43,180
into an unsustainable trajectory

1251
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:45,700
where our money is not getting,

1252
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,620
it's not solving our problems as a society.

1253
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:51,820
And there's becoming so much of it because of inflation

1254
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:54,780
that it's not even getting us that far anyways.

1255
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:58,300
So between inflation of a debased currency

1256
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:03,300
and overly centralization of decision-making in a society,

1257
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:07,500
that's what really leads to very serious

1258
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:11,420
and systemic issues in societies that otherwise, right?

1259
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:15,300
Like most major empires don't fall because of the military.

1260
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:16,660
They fall internally.

1261
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:19,740
And these are the mechanisms that like some

1262
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,780
of the AI systems that we've been studying

1263
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:23,780
are addressing aspects of this.

1264
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:27,300
Different economic models from archeologists

1265
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:28,300
even are seeing this.

1266
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,820
And this is a recurrent pattern.

1267
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:33,020
And they say history doesn't repeat itself, it rhymes.

1268
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:36,540
And I worry that this is what we're looking at right now.

1269
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:39,820
And unless we really find a way to kind of get back

1270
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:41,900
to local communities and just address

1271
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:45,020
what the people of the United States are worried about

1272
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:48,140
and not be worried about what the people in DC

1273
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:49,780
are worried about or coastal elites

1274
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,780
and cities generally are worried about

1275
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,820
and kind of get back to the ground, right?

1276
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:54,940
Get back to the earth.

1277
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:59,740
We're not gonna be dealing with an ideological reality

1278
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:02,140
that can solve the very real problems

1279
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:03,940
that we're gonna face over the next,

1280
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:05,900
let's say 50 to 100 years.

1281
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:10,100
Government justifies its existence as a problem solver.

1282
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:13,060
So solving problems is against the interest

1283
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:14,660
of government's existence.

1284
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:17,460
Because if you solve problem, there is no government.

1285
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,220
Right?

1286
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:21,300
I think this is one of the main reasons

1287
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:25,660
why the biggest structural change

1288
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:29,820
that Americans should mandate, right?

1289
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:33,860
Make it a non-negotiable or term limits.

1290
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:35,820
Because, and this actually comes from something

1291
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:37,460
I remember reading from Thomas Jefferson

1292
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:41,500
is that the politician should not be a job,

1293
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,740
being a politician should not be a career.

1294
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:46,140
It should be something you don't even want to do, right?

1295
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,980
It should be something you're forced or obliged to do

1296
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:52,020
because you feel it is your duty as an American

1297
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:54,420
to be a government servant.

1298
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:57,300
But that through term limits, you're forced

1299
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:00,500
to deal with the reality that you create.

1300
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,140
So that if you're a farmer, when you go in,

1301
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:05,700
you got four years, maybe we'll get you six years

1302
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:07,020
in the Senate or something like that.

1303
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:08,260
And then after those six years,

1304
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:10,580
you're gonna go back to farming.

1305
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:13,700
And if you screwed up the country,

1306
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,900
it's gonna make your life harder.

1307
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,020
What the biggest risk and one of the reasons

1308
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:20,220
why I think we see what we see in America today

1309
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:25,220
is because Nancy Pelosi can get in in 1985

1310
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:29,060
and she doesn't have to do anything except stand up

1311
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:32,740
and say a bunch of nonsense, ruin a bunch of people's lives.

1312
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:37,740
And then she comes out with a net worth of $120 million,

1313
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,940
which given taxes, I saw a funny thing,

1314
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:45,940
a napkin calculation that I was doing is that effectively,

1315
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:50,940
if we assume, right, her salary is 233,000 a year.

1316
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:54,840
So if we assume that she lived a very, very,

1317
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:59,820
let's say a life within her means, which she didn't,

1318
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:04,420
and that she invested $100,000 a year on average

1319
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:08,380
since she basically got into politics in like 1987,

1320
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:13,380
then her average returns must have been about 30 to 35%

1321
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:17,540
investing in the market.

1322
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:19,780
It is how she could have had to have made that money.

1323
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:22,120
That makes her the greatest investor

1324
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,340
in the history of the country.

1325
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:25,300
Warren Buffett's average annual returns

1326
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:28,020
are about 20% on average a year.

1327
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:30,080
So we need to stop reading Warren Buffett

1328
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,800
and we need to choose whatever strategy

1329
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,680
Nancy Pelosi has chosen in her investments.

1330
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:37,440
And that I think is interesting question to ask is,

1331
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,300
well, if she causes the problems,

1332
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:42,620
if she solves the problems and she contracts the companies

1333
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:46,200
that are going to or are not going to solve these problems,

1334
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:50,180
is it possible that she was doing something

1335
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:51,380
that she shouldn't have been?

1336
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:53,700
And obviously it seems very clear

1337
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:58,060
that she's been insider trading for 35 years,

1338
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:00,560
because otherwise you can't save enough.

1339
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:02,580
It would take her like a thousand years

1340
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,660
to save that much money.

1341
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:05,500
It's not a chance.

1342
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,020
And the beauty of this era is that the jig is up.

1343
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:10,860
You know, the curtain has fallen.

1344
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:13,260
So we'll see where it leads.

1345
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:15,700
I don't think Nancy Pelosi was an early investor

1346
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,420
in Bitcoin or anything like that.

1347
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:19,140
So it's...

1348
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:21,420
Not according to her financial returns.

1349
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:22,260
Maybe she's not.

1350
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,740
I mean, is she lying?

1351
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:24,580
I would not be so sure.

1352
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:25,420
Nancy Pelosi lying.

1353
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:27,540
I think the funniest thing about this, right?

1354
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:30,740
I think my favorite thing about the news

1355
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:31,780
that I heard about her recently

1356
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,620
is that she's moving to Florida.

1357
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,020
Yes, yeah.

1358
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:36,660
So it's like, so she's actually,

1359
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:38,940
she's from Maryland originally.

1360
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:41,900
So she's like from my neck of the woods.

1361
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:44,860
And then she moved out to California basically as,

1362
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:47,220
you know, because her parents

1363
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:48,980
were well connected in politics.

1364
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:50,540
So she gets out to California,

1365
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:53,300
ruins California for 35 years, and then goes,

1366
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:54,140
oh, you know where I'm gonna go?

1367
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:55,380
I'm gonna go to Florida.

1368
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:58,020
Even though she was one of those people

1369
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:00,580
that was calling DeSantis basically a murderer

1370
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:01,420
because he wasn't gonna do long-term.

1371
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:02,260
They all did.

1372
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:03,100
AOC was here partying.

1373
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,020
She was calling DeSantis murderer.

1374
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:05,860
I heard about this.

1375
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:07,740
Yeah, they were saying, oh, this is murder

1376
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:09,380
and all that you're killing innocent lives.

1377
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:11,180
And it's like the first place you guys go

1378
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:13,380
when you get a chance to go somewhere is there.

1379
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:16,060
And then AOC got COVID for partying,

1380
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:17,660
maskless in Florida.

1381
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:20,180
And she's been awfully silent about it.

1382
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:22,500
And I think that's funny.

1383
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:26,820
But hey, I think AOC revealed something very fundamental

1384
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:29,020
very early on when she said that

1385
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:31,260
it's more important to be morally right

1386
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:32,860
than factually correct.

1387
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:36,180
And that's all we need to know about how they operate,

1388
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:37,660
how they see the world.

1389
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:39,940
And this is my concern

1390
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:43,980
that the very same people are in charge

1391
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:47,180
of these AI systems that are being built,

1392
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:52,180
that AI ethics and AI ethicists are hell-bent

1393
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:54,580
on monopolizing them on Google.

1394
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:56,060
And there's been a civil war going on

1395
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:58,300
in the Google AI department for a while

1396
01:00:58,300 --> 01:00:59,620
and in many other places.

1397
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:02,140
So this localization that you're saying politically,

1398
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:03,900
which is absolutely the way,

1399
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:06,660
it seems to be the absolutely the way for AI as well

1400
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:09,820
to decentralize this development of AI

1401
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:12,700
that even if it's going to lead to AGI,

1402
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:14,500
which for example, Ben Goertzel believes

1403
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:17,900
that we're gonna reach AGI in like 10 years, 15 years,

1404
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:21,140
and he's building his singularity net because of that.

1405
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:23,460
So AGI wouldn't be owned by them.

1406
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:25,980
Yeah, I'm all in favor of that kind of an approach,

1407
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:27,860
but it also begs the question

1408
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:30,740
that how are we going to be decentralized

1409
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:32,700
yet operating on the basis

1410
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:34,700
of some kind of a point of alignment,

1411
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:36,860
which goes back to the beginning of our conversation

1412
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,380
that there are certain values

1413
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:42,260
that define the identity of the perspective.

1414
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:44,500
Exactly, and I do think that that's one of the things

1415
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,420
that Ben's not taking into account.

1416
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:52,220
It's kind of funny, he was at Oxford for a conference.

1417
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:54,580
He did like the AGI conference,

1418
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:56,700
global conference was at Oxford while I was there.

1419
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:59,700
And I got to go out and have a couple of beers with him

1420
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,940
and with Dave Hansen as well, who-

1421
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:02,780
His partner.

1422
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:03,620
Hansen Robotics.

1423
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:05,300
Yeah, yeah, they do a lot together.

1424
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:06,780
They're very like, they're friends.

1425
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:09,100
They're like honest friends too.

1426
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,580
They were very interesting guys as well.

1427
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:13,580
I had met Dave Hansen before actually

1428
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:15,100
at the Harrison Institute.

1429
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:17,180
He was doing some work on BINA-48,

1430
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:19,940
one of the first like robots that he worked with.

1431
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:21,820
Martin Rothblatt.

1432
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:23,140
Yes, yes, exactly.

1433
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:26,060
And so I was there, it's in Vermont.

1434
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:27,700
So it was actually not far from where I was living

1435
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:30,900
at the time and got to meet them and talk to them.

1436
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:34,260
And they have a very utopian view,

1437
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:39,260
which in a way I like their positivity,

1438
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:44,700
but I do worry that sometimes positivity can lead to naivety.

1439
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:50,620
And I like the idea of if there is going to be an AGI,

1440
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:55,060
it needs to be decentralized because any centralization,

1441
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:57,700
like I said before, right, is prone to issues.

1442
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:02,700
And just like AOC wouldn't want Trump in charge of the AGI,

1443
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:07,140
I wouldn't want AOC in charge of the AI, right?

1444
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:09,380
You don't have enough natural intelligence, I sure as hell

1445
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:11,100
don't want you to have the artificial one.

1446
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:14,900
And that's something I think that's interesting.

1447
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:17,380
And you mentioned Google, for example,

1448
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:22,340
and Google's big issue in AI ethics recently, right,

1449
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:26,420
hasn't even been, you know, should we build this?

1450
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:28,900
They just kind of build it and then move on.

1451
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:30,580
There has been some issue with DeepMind.

1452
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:32,540
DeepMind doesn't want to be part of Google anymore.

1453
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:35,580
And I'm very interested to know more about why that is,

1454
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:37,020
but not much has come out about it,

1455
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:39,100
except for the fact that they asked

1456
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:41,260
to basically be spun out.

1457
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:45,780
But the biggest AI issue in Google recently

1458
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:48,620
hasn't been mass surveillance, hasn't been data protection,

1459
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:50,660
hasn't been data ethics, the right to be forgotten

1460
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:51,780
or any of these other things.

1461
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:54,060
It was Geberu, it was, you know,

1462
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:57,300
the fact that one of their AI researchers was,

1463
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,020
who has done actually really good work too, by the way,

1464
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:02,660
like I'm not trying to throw her under the bus.

1465
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:04,580
I have a lot of respect for some of the work she's done,

1466
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:08,580
but she did not want to go through a peer reviewed process,

1467
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:10,100
right, and she said, if you don't,

1468
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:12,980
if I can't go around this peer review, then I'm resigning.

1469
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:15,060
And Google said, we accept.

1470
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,500
And she said she was fired.

1471
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:17,860
No, she was not fired.

1472
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:20,220
She resigned, she gave them the ultimatum

1473
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:23,140
and they called her bluff, I guess.

1474
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:24,620
But the fact of the matter is that

1475
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:27,460
that was in a nutshell, right?

1476
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:30,500
It's better to be morally right than factually correct.

1477
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,340
Exactly.

1478
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:32,180
That's what that was,

1479
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:35,420
is I don't want to put myself up for critique

1480
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:38,980
to be shown factually correct,

1481
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:40,940
which is bizarre to me, right?

1482
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:43,540
Because one of the findings that like Geberu

1483
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:44,380
and some of the colleagues

1484
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:46,260
that work on those problems have found, right,

1485
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:49,820
has to do with like things like gender and racial biases

1486
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:53,740
in AI and they've mathematically proven

1487
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:57,300
without a shadow of a doubt that biases exist

1488
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:59,780
in the way that they've presented them.

1489
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:02,460
You can't deny, like it's just, it's mathematically provable.

1490
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:05,300
It's undeniable that those biases exist.

1491
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:08,220
And so for me, it's like, look,

1492
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:10,460
that it aligns with her ideology.

1493
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:12,780
She does go more towards the woke side.

1494
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:14,780
And I think that that's fine, right?

1495
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:18,420
If there's a systemic bias in our AI,

1496
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:20,460
we need to either address it

1497
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:22,620
or know that it exists and be comfortable with it.

1498
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:23,620
And if we're not comfortable

1499
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:26,940
with certain racial or gender biases,

1500
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:28,260
many of them there personally,

1501
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:29,100
I'm not comfortable with them.

1502
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:30,060
I'd like to see them.

1503
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:33,420
I'd like to see us understand how we can address them

1504
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:36,380
rather than just going in and addressing them.

1505
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:38,020
I think we need to raise those questions,

1506
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:42,860
but saying either you stop asking me these questions

1507
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:47,340
or I quit, that's not something that I think is very helpful.

1508
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:49,420
Just criticizing the high priest,

1509
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:51,740
like exactly what we're talking about.

1510
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:52,580
Yeah, right.

1511
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:55,980
You can't, or ex-communication befalls you, right?

1512
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:57,940
And I think this is exactly the kind of thing

1513
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:02,780
that worries me about the fact that most AI developers

1514
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:06,580
and most people making big decisions in AI ethics

1515
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:11,260
come from, I'm not so much worried about left, right,

1516
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:16,260
so much as I'm worried about woke, the woke ideology.

1517
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:18,340
People will always be more left or more right.

1518
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:21,860
And it's largely a meaningless designation anyways, right?

1519
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:23,780
Because for me, I know people who are really far left,

1520
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:26,060
but they're also anti-authoritarianists.

1521
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:27,660
And I actually get along really well with them

1522
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:29,940
because fundamentally, I kind of agree with them

1523
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:31,620
because they're anti-authoritarian.

1524
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:34,940
So whatever nonsense they might believe that I disagree with,

1525
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:36,300
they're not gonna force it on me.

1526
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:37,700
And so I'm like, all right, that's cool.

1527
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:39,220
You do you, I'll do me.

1528
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:41,620
And the same with people who are on the far right,

1529
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:43,860
that are further right than I am.

1530
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:46,580
I, you know, so long as they're not authoritarian,

1531
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:47,900
I'm okay, it's just a disagreement.

1532
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:49,140
But the moment they go, oh,

1533
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:53,140
and I think you should do this too, I get worried.

1534
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:56,740
And a lot of the people who are on the AI side

1535
01:06:56,740 --> 01:07:00,340
are also saying, and here's what I believe,

1536
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:03,300
I've designed AI to try and mimic what I believe,

1537
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:06,740
and I'm going to force this AI to force you

1538
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:09,820
to conform to my beliefs.

1539
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:11,780
And the biggest way that that is,

1540
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:13,980
that's instantiated today, I think,

1541
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:16,340
is in censorship on social media.

1542
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:20,860
For example, I mean, and some of these are horrendous, right?

1543
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:25,860
So for example, not being able to even discuss the laptop,

1544
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:29,700
Hunter Biden's laptop right before the election.

1545
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:31,740
And oh, it was a bombshell to manipulate the election.

1546
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:33,660
It was like, yeah, and the entirety of the media

1547
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:36,820
before then was, you know, no blood on anyone's hands

1548
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:38,620
on trying to support a candidate before then,

1549
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:40,380
that's when it started, right?

1550
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:41,220
It's nonsense.

1551
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:43,460
Now, all the people who came out,

1552
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:46,220
retired people from intelligence communities

1553
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:49,860
who signed that letter that this is Russia propaganda.

1554
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:52,980
So what's going to happen to those people?

1555
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:54,780
You know, this is a problem.

1556
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,900
Is there going to be any recourse to that?

1557
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:58,300
I mean, but when you look at what happened

1558
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:00,180
with the original Russia game, right?

1559
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:02,900
I mean, so much of that was shown to basically,

1560
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:05,780
and basically in the end, when they investigated it,

1561
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:08,300
the Democrats, you know, the opposition

1562
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:12,220
looked just as bad or worse than Trump and his crowd.

1563
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:15,540
If anything, I think it made Trump look rather inept.

1564
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:18,380
You know, not this grand conspirator.

1565
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:20,700
He was not the wizard of Oz here.

1566
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,900
You know, he was not the man behind the green curtain.

1567
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,540
If anything, he was kind of, you know,

1568
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:27,660
the tin man sitting around waiting for everybody else.

1569
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:31,260
Meanwhile, you see people like, you know,

1570
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:33,580
Hillary Clinton in the background in her campaign,

1571
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:35,820
trying to pull all of these little levers,

1572
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:39,260
and the further we dug into it, the further it looked like

1573
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:42,460
this was just a lot of nonsense on all sides,

1574
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:45,660
but this media narrative became unbreakable, right?

1575
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:48,700
It became like, Russia game became like blue anon.

1576
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:51,500
It was just like the Democrats' version of the conspiracy

1577
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,980
that the further left you go,

1578
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:58,460
the more you find it to be an unassailable truth.

1579
01:08:58,460 --> 01:08:59,820
And it was, yeah, it was really,

1580
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:01,980
it was really worrying, I think, to see that.

1581
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:05,980
I think, you know, there's a case for moderation

1582
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:09,660
to be made when we look, and I mean moderation,

1583
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:11,740
like moderating our own behaviors

1584
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:13,420
and supports towards social media.

1585
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:15,820
When you look at the fact that they don't allow us

1586
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:19,900
to speak about certain things because of a political agenda,

1587
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:21,660
and then they tell us they're apolitical,

1588
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:24,620
it's like, don't, you know, don't tell me that.

1589
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:26,780
Like, it's obviously not true.

1590
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:29,500
Just be honest, if you're gonna be away,

1591
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:30,940
just be honest about it.

1592
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:32,780
Just be honest about it so that I know

1593
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:34,620
not to use your social media platform

1594
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:36,180
if you're not gonna allow me

1595
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:38,340
to participate in a conversation.

1596
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:40,700
And I think, you know, you mentioned earlier, right?

1597
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:43,260
That having the conversation is critical to democracy

1598
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:46,060
and people just don't even know about the AI that exists

1599
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:47,820
and the problems with social media.

1600
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:49,100
One of the reasons for this

1601
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:51,940
is a very suspicious event that happened, right?

1602
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:54,900
When Frances Howigan, who previously worked for Facebook,

1603
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:58,300
released all of these documents as a whistleblower,

1604
01:09:58,300 --> 01:09:59,660
she releases all of these documents.

1605
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:01,060
It goes onto the Wall Street Journal.

1606
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:02,660
She ends up appearing before the Senate

1607
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:03,700
and all of this stuff.

1608
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:07,580
When those documents were released,

1609
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:11,340
they were going viral across several social media channels,

1610
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:13,180
but they weren't going viral

1611
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:15,500
on the largest social media channels

1612
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:16,820
basically in the world, right?

1613
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:19,460
Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram,

1614
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:20,940
because all three of those companies

1615
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:22,460
are all owned by Facebook.

1616
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:24,460
Now, since the revelation, right?

1617
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:25,940
Now they change their name to Meta

1618
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:27,540
and not Facebook anymore.

1619
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:31,340
So they're all three being accused

1620
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:33,500
or it's being demonstrated

1621
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,940
that they knew that they were bad for society.

1622
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:38,340
They knew that they were being politically manipulative

1623
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:41,820
and politically manipulated by external forces.

1624
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:44,660
And instead of going viral on Facebook,

1625
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:47,140
all of the Facebook servers just shut down

1626
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:50,260
for, you know, what was it?

1627
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:52,100
Eight, 12 hours.

1628
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:54,660
Now, any social media researcher will tell you

1629
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:57,220
that when hot news breaks,

1630
01:10:57,220 --> 01:11:00,420
the first six to 12 hours after it's posted

1631
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:03,420
is critical to determining the amplitude, right?

1632
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:05,140
How high it will go.

1633
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:06,580
It'll go a little viral,

1634
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:09,220
but is it gonna go three million viral

1635
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:11,980
or is it gonna go three billion viral?

1636
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:14,300
And that Francis Howgood news had the possibility

1637
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:17,180
to go three billion accounts viral

1638
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:19,780
across all of the different social media channels.

1639
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:20,980
But it didn't happen.

1640
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:22,260
And the reason it didn't happen

1641
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:25,820
is because somebody made a coding error at Facebook

1642
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:27,900
at exactly the right time.

1643
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:30,380
And all of those servers mysteriously went down

1644
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:32,300
for an unrelated reason.

1645
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:34,580
And it's like, come on.

1646
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:37,940
And you see that they'll give you a slap on the wrist

1647
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:40,260
for questioning about Hunter Biden,

1648
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:44,220
but they will shut the whole farm down

1649
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:45,660
if it makes them look bad

1650
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:48,940
and it exposes what they've knowingly been doing for years.

1651
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:51,580
Yeah, so more liberty, less secrecy,

1652
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:54,340
more transparency, less secrecy,

1653
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:58,220
more decentralization, less centralization.

1654
01:11:58,220 --> 01:11:59,700
A hundred percent, man.

1655
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:00,980
The world's weird and chaotic.

1656
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:01,820
Let's love it.

1657
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:03,420
Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

1658
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:04,540
Yeah, right with it.

1659
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:08,620
Unfortunately, we're reaching the end

1660
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:09,940
because your time is limited

1661
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:11,620
and I really appreciate this conversation.

1662
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:12,460
It was awesome.

1663
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:15,540
Let me ask you the last question I ask all my guests.

1664
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,740
If you come across an intelligent alien

1665
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:19,180
from a different civilization,

1666
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:22,220
what would you say is the worst thing humanity has done

1667
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:24,780
and what would you say is their greatest achievement?

1668
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:28,220
What is the worst thing,

1669
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:31,660
like single event that humanity has done?

1670
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:33,660
Or something we built,

1671
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:35,580
worst and best in humanity.

1672
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:38,780
The worst and best in humanity.

1673
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:44,940
Okay, that's a hard one to answer.

1674
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:46,660
That's a good question.

1675
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:52,500
So for me, I think that the worst of humanity

1676
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:56,420
has been embodied historically

1677
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:58,900
and the biggest threat to humanity

1678
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:02,180
is also the biggest threat to humanity in the future.

1679
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:03,900
And that is Marxism.

1680
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:10,140
That as a ideology, what it's done, right?

1681
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:12,700
It saddens me.

1682
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:17,260
And then I live in a post-communist country now, right?

1683
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:19,940
So the Iron Curtain is like 20 minutes from here.

1684
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:21,820
I can walk along the Iron Curtain

1685
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:24,580
and they have names of people

1686
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:26,660
who were literally eaten alive by dogs

1687
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:28,060
for trying to cross the Iron Curtain

1688
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:31,060
and just get to Austria to get to their freedom.

1689
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:32,900
And I've lost track of the number of people

1690
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:33,740
that I've spoken to here

1691
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:38,620
that were smuggled out as children to freedom in the West.

1692
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:41,580
And so having learned about it is one thing,

1693
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:43,420
but then having heard the stories of people

1694
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:45,060
who have lived through it here in Slovakia.

1695
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:46,900
And as I learned the Slovak language,

1696
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:49,100
I can talk to the older generation, right?

1697
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:50,620
Who couldn't learn English, right?

1698
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:52,580
And I get to hear their stories and stuff.

1699
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:57,580
And that is, I think, that's our darkest moment,

1700
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:02,980
I think, is Marxism and communism.

1701
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,420
And it's still today.

1702
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:09,420
Our greatest achievement, our greatest achievement, man,

1703
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:25,380
in a way, I would say that our greatest achievement

1704
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:30,380
as a species was probably, is probably the internet.

1705
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:40,940
Yeah, I would say our greatest achievement is the internet.

1706
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:45,940
Our finest hour is this massive technological

1707
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:50,820
ridiculousness that is both beautiful and it's energy

1708
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:53,020
and it's complicated and it's complicated

1709
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:56,660
beautiful and it's energy and it's communication.

1710
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:03,140
And my hope is that we realize that no matter

1711
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:06,820
what it is we create as people,

1712
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:09,340
and no matter how beautiful something

1713
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:12,380
like our greatest technologies are,

1714
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:16,780
nothing is ever going to be better or more beautiful

1715
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:20,860
than just walking out in the woods

1716
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:23,340
with your friends and loved ones

1717
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:25,940
and actually turning the phones off

1718
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:28,300
and sitting around a bonfire.

1719
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:30,460
That would be it.

1720
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:34,220
So maybe my other answer, if I can have two,

1721
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:37,180
is the greatest achievement humans ever had

1722
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:39,300
was figuring out how to light a fire.

1723
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:42,860
That's, I'll keep it with that.

1724
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:45,620
Beautiful.

1725
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:50,620
Awesome.

1726
01:16:15,620 --> 01:16:16,860
Thank you.
