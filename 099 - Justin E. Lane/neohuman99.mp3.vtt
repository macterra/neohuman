WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.680
when you overly centralize power

00:02.680 --> 00:05.080
or you overly centralize the culture,

00:05.080 --> 00:06.840
like the cultural permissibility,

00:09.120 --> 00:11.480
you end up breaking the system.

00:11.480 --> 00:14.660
And the fact of the matter is just that,

00:14.660 --> 00:17.000
humans are different, like we're all different.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.200
And that's the cool thing about us, actually.

00:20.200 --> 00:22.440
It's what I love the most is,

00:22.440 --> 00:23.980
when I talk to somebody,

00:23.980 --> 00:26.080
you don't know what's gonna happen, right?

00:26.080 --> 00:28.080
They could be end up being your best friend

00:28.080 --> 00:30.900
or you could just be like, I didn't like that guy at all.

00:30.900 --> 00:31.740
Right?

00:31.740 --> 00:36.560
And it's just, that's our beauty and that's our curse, right?

00:36.560 --> 00:38.840
Cause sometimes we're too different to get along.

00:38.840 --> 00:41.620
And other times we're just different enough to cooperate,

00:41.620 --> 00:43.760
but we're not gonna be friends, but we'll be colleagues,

00:43.760 --> 00:46.440
like, you know, and everything in between.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.960
And when you overly centralize power

00:48.960 --> 00:51.360
to people of a specific kind of belief

00:51.360 --> 00:54.080
or a specific kind of background,

00:54.080 --> 00:56.320
you're always going to neglect the people

00:56.320 --> 00:57.720
that are towards the extremity

00:57.720 --> 01:00.840
of wherever you sit on that spectrum.

01:00.840 --> 01:04.480
And so that is never going to create stability

01:04.480 --> 01:06.120
because eventually everyone else

01:06.120 --> 01:08.120
is gonna start teaming up on you

01:08.120 --> 01:10.780
and you're going to effectively be an imperialist

01:10.780 --> 01:12.380
within your own country.

01:12.380 --> 01:13.800
And this happens whenever you see

01:13.800 --> 01:15.980
the centralization of power, right?

01:15.980 --> 01:19.880
Every single major historical example

01:19.880 --> 01:23.680
of a complex society that has collapsed,

01:23.680 --> 01:28.680
has collapsed effectively because it overly centralized

01:28.720 --> 01:33.000
economic decision-making and overly pushed that

01:33.000 --> 01:36.640
to deal with problems that it itself was creating.

01:36.640 --> 01:39.640
["The 100th Episode"]

01:44.760 --> 01:46.640
All right, Justin, Elaine,

01:46.640 --> 01:49.840
welcome to what's supposed to be the 100th episode.

01:49.840 --> 01:50.720
I know I told you that,

01:50.720 --> 01:53.200
but my guests canceled on the day of,

01:53.200 --> 01:56.480
so we're on the 99th episode of Neo Human Podcast.

01:56.480 --> 01:58.280
Still a pretty good number.

01:58.280 --> 01:59.800
That's a very good number.

01:59.800 --> 02:01.460
That's a very good number.

02:01.460 --> 02:02.360
Yeah, thank you.

02:02.360 --> 02:03.200
Thank you for your time

02:03.200 --> 02:04.440
and thank you for being here, man.

02:04.440 --> 02:05.260
Really appreciate it.

02:05.260 --> 02:06.200
Yeah, thanks for having me.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.040
I'm happy to be here.

02:07.040 --> 02:08.000
I think this is gonna be fun.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.320
Yeah, I saw you on War Room

02:10.320 --> 02:14.280
and I thought your research

02:14.280 --> 02:16.240
is about something very, very interesting.

02:16.240 --> 02:18.200
It's about, from my perspective,

02:18.200 --> 02:20.600
about the tool and the intention behind the tool,

02:20.600 --> 02:22.700
which is AI and religion.

02:22.700 --> 02:25.080
So I'm hoping that we get to that,

02:25.080 --> 02:26.880
but before getting into any of that,

02:26.880 --> 02:28.120
I'm talking about your book.

02:28.120 --> 02:29.760
You also have a new book.

02:29.760 --> 02:31.000
Congratulations about that.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.920
Understanding Religion Through Artificial Intelligence,

02:33.920 --> 02:35.880
Bonding, and Belief.

02:35.880 --> 02:37.420
We'll be talking about that too,

02:37.420 --> 02:39.920
but just so we can have some kind of a context,

02:39.920 --> 02:41.160
let's start with your background,

02:41.160 --> 02:42.960
the works you've done, the lives you've lived,

02:42.960 --> 02:45.800
and what are you mainly focused on now these days?

02:45.800 --> 02:48.240
Yeah, so I've lived many lives

02:48.240 --> 02:49.920
in my short time on this earth.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.960
I've been very blessed in that regard.

02:52.960 --> 02:56.520
So I'm originally from the DC area,

02:56.520 --> 02:58.920
kind of grew up in a really small town

02:58.920 --> 03:00.040
on the Eastern Shore of Maryland,

03:00.040 --> 03:03.440
where it's just chicken coops and corn fields mostly.

03:04.820 --> 03:08.720
And that's, it kind of ties back in later,

03:08.720 --> 03:10.640
which is why I mentioned this.

03:10.640 --> 03:14.000
I did my undergraduate studies in religion, actually,

03:14.000 --> 03:16.120
at the University of Vermont,

03:16.120 --> 03:17.920
where I got really interested actually

03:17.920 --> 03:22.920
in this idea that every culture

03:23.240 --> 03:24.280
and every group of people

03:24.280 --> 03:27.360
throughout all of human history has had religion.

03:27.360 --> 03:31.320
And I grew up in the Methodist Church,

03:31.320 --> 03:33.360
and I had a really positive experience in the church

03:33.360 --> 03:35.320
as a kid for the most part.

03:35.320 --> 03:38.820
And then, of course, I was in high school around 9-11.

03:38.820 --> 03:41.460
And on the one hand, I have my personal experience,

03:41.460 --> 03:42.920
which is positive with religion.

03:42.920 --> 03:46.740
It was really a bedrock for my family growing up.

03:46.740 --> 03:48.440
And then, of course, I also see

03:48.440 --> 03:50.560
that religion can breed terrorism.

03:50.560 --> 03:54.220
And so it kind of just led to a lot of questions in my mind.

03:54.220 --> 03:58.400
And I kind of set off to try and answer the question of,

03:58.400 --> 04:01.400
why do people do things that are so irrational

04:02.380 --> 04:06.080
as kill themselves in the name of their God?

04:06.080 --> 04:08.640
But then also, how can this one thing,

04:08.640 --> 04:10.960
how can these deeply held beliefs

04:10.960 --> 04:15.440
and how can our faith inspire both beauty and horror?

04:15.440 --> 04:18.200
And it kind of set me off in that curiosity,

04:18.200 --> 04:21.120
that curiosity set me off in my direction.

04:21.120 --> 04:23.240
I realized around the time

04:24.100 --> 04:25.680
that I was finishing my degree, actually,

04:25.680 --> 04:28.080
that being able to program computers,

04:28.080 --> 04:31.280
it was a skill that I had that was fairly unique

04:31.280 --> 04:33.600
amongst people who study religion.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.900
Most people who study religion, they read texts.

04:36.900 --> 04:41.240
My languages in college were Latin and ancient Greek,

04:41.240 --> 04:43.160
not Python or Java,

04:43.160 --> 04:46.200
which is what I use to study religion now.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.000
So it really kind of set me down that path.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.360
And I realized I had to go to Europe

04:50.360 --> 04:51.960
to kind of study this further.

04:51.960 --> 04:53.440
American universities

04:53.440 --> 04:56.480
are not into a scientific approach to religion.

04:56.480 --> 05:00.120
They really want to push this sort of like

05:00.120 --> 05:02.720
hard post-modernist ideology.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.640
They want to look at cultural relativism

05:04.640 --> 05:06.480
and everything has to be described.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.440
And science is just kind of like

05:08.440 --> 05:10.520
lensing this imperial patriarchy

05:10.520 --> 05:12.200
over top of other people.

05:12.200 --> 05:15.960
And that wasn't going anywhere for me.

05:15.960 --> 05:17.480
It really, I needed to be able

05:17.480 --> 05:19.480
to use the scientific approach.

05:19.480 --> 05:23.480
And so I went to Belfast, actually, in Northern Ireland.

05:23.480 --> 05:26.800
Of course, Belfast is well known for the troubles

05:26.800 --> 05:29.140
that they've had between the Protestants and the Catholics

05:29.140 --> 05:32.880
for years, for decades at this point.

05:32.880 --> 05:36.040
And so living there kind of also framed it.

05:36.040 --> 05:37.900
And I said, okay, well, I've studied conflict,

05:37.900 --> 05:39.000
I've studied AI,

05:39.000 --> 05:41.640
and now I also want to try and study stability.

05:41.640 --> 05:45.080
And so I did my doctoral research at Oxford University

05:47.000 --> 05:48.520
where for part of that, actually,

05:48.520 --> 05:50.000
and I did my doctoral research

05:50.000 --> 05:52.880
in anthropology department, believe it or not,

05:52.880 --> 05:55.920
where I used data science and AI

05:55.920 --> 05:57.680
to try and answer critical questions

05:57.680 --> 06:00.000
about why large scale religions persist

06:00.000 --> 06:01.720
the way they do today.

06:01.720 --> 06:04.760
And I went to Singapore actually to validate this

06:04.760 --> 06:07.360
because Singapore is the most religiously diverse nation

06:07.360 --> 06:08.200
on earth.

06:08.200 --> 06:11.040
And it is insanely stable

06:11.040 --> 06:14.200
given its levels of diversity on every metric.

06:14.200 --> 06:15.500
So it's kind of an anomaly.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.800
So I wanted to study that and see, you know,

06:17.800 --> 06:18.620
what can I learn?

06:18.620 --> 06:20.160
How can I compare it to Belfast?

06:20.160 --> 06:22.720
How can I compare it to what I see in America?

06:22.720 --> 06:24.100
You know, what does that kind of mean?

06:24.100 --> 06:26.120
And that kind of set me off on my journey

06:26.120 --> 06:29.360
of what brought me to Europe and went back,

06:29.360 --> 06:31.540
did some teaching and some work at Boston University

06:31.540 --> 06:35.420
for a few years as a postdoctoral fellow

06:35.420 --> 06:36.640
at the Center for Mind and Culture

06:36.640 --> 06:40.260
and then came back to Europe and started working,

06:40.260 --> 06:43.680
really doing consultancy and then started a private company

06:43.680 --> 06:46.440
that does work in simulation and data analytics

06:46.440 --> 06:50.380
to try and help people, you know, navigate social media

06:50.380 --> 06:53.200
without having to rely on censorship

06:53.200 --> 06:56.640
and without having to rely on the sensationalist algorithms

06:56.640 --> 06:57.840
of like Twitter and Facebook

06:57.840 --> 07:00.000
to kind of promote material in a negative way.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.760
So trying to, you know, make social media fun again.

07:04.440 --> 07:07.540
That's a noble objective.

07:07.540 --> 07:12.540
Thanks, I might be doomed to fail, but I'm doomed to try.

07:12.560 --> 07:15.420
Well, I mean, it really is about,

07:15.420 --> 07:18.260
you mentioned you were wondering about how religion

07:18.260 --> 07:21.180
give birth to the worst and the best of humanity,

07:21.180 --> 07:24.520
but it really seems to be the natural,

07:24.520 --> 07:26.780
undeniable natural reality of who we are

07:26.780 --> 07:29.060
that we are capable of doing the worst

07:29.060 --> 07:31.820
and we are capable of doing the best.

07:31.820 --> 07:34.460
And, you know, some would even say

07:34.460 --> 07:36.540
that one wouldn't exist without the other.

07:36.540 --> 07:39.180
So we have to take them all together.

07:39.180 --> 07:43.540
So this is an interesting point with respect to religions

07:43.540 --> 07:46.340
and then AI, because AI is being used

07:46.340 --> 07:49.060
as an underlaying of some kind of a system

07:49.060 --> 07:52.540
that as you put it, brings some kind of a stability

07:52.540 --> 07:56.140
with respect or we're having in mind

07:56.140 --> 07:58.340
to have a certain degree of respect

07:58.340 --> 08:01.140
for diversity of thoughts and ideas and perspectives

08:01.140 --> 08:03.660
and, you know, all those kinds of philosophies

08:03.660 --> 08:05.500
and worldviews.

08:05.500 --> 08:08.820
Yeah, I think, yeah, and I also think, you know,

08:08.820 --> 08:11.300
it's interesting to think of those things

08:11.300 --> 08:14.220
as, you know, the positive with the negative.

08:14.220 --> 08:16.500
You know, in some cases, religion is a tool

08:16.500 --> 08:19.980
that people leverage for their own means, right?

08:19.980 --> 08:22.900
A lot of people pick and choose different things

08:22.900 --> 08:26.020
in a religious text just to justify what they're gonna do

08:26.020 --> 08:29.260
and what they really wanna do is political actually.

08:29.260 --> 08:31.700
And they just want religion to justify it.

08:31.700 --> 08:35.060
It's a flag that they fly more than anything else.

08:35.060 --> 08:37.700
And in that regards, you know, any tool

08:37.700 --> 08:39.940
when it's used for good can do great things

08:39.940 --> 08:44.460
and when it's used for evil can do horrible things, right?

08:44.460 --> 08:47.820
So, you know, AI also is like that.

08:48.660 --> 08:50.020
Artificial intelligence, of course,

08:50.020 --> 08:52.020
can automate all sorts of interesting things.

08:52.020 --> 08:55.100
You know, it protects us from fraud on our credit cards,

08:55.100 --> 08:58.540
but it also is exacerbating social instability globally,

08:58.540 --> 09:02.500
I think, because of the way that it selectively promotes

09:02.500 --> 09:04.860
sensationalism on social media

09:04.860 --> 09:07.740
and the way that it's constantly pinging us,

09:07.740 --> 09:09.900
you know, in our brains, basically, you know,

09:09.900 --> 09:12.540
quite literally, I guess, you know, in our pockets

09:12.540 --> 09:15.580
to constantly pay attention and go for social validation

09:15.580 --> 09:18.380
for something that's not real.

09:18.380 --> 09:20.980
And insofar as social media is real,

09:20.980 --> 09:23.020
it's not what's really important.

09:24.420 --> 09:27.060
You know, religion has had a tough time.

09:27.060 --> 09:29.580
Religions generally have had a tough time

09:29.580 --> 09:33.180
making the jump to the social media space, right?

09:33.180 --> 09:35.220
Even the, you know, the Pope has a lot of followers

09:35.220 --> 09:37.060
on Twitter, but you don't hear about the Pope

09:37.060 --> 09:39.260
going viral on Twitter, right?

09:39.260 --> 09:41.620
And I think part of it is because religion

09:41.620 --> 09:46.260
is fundamentally something that is really deep rooted

09:46.260 --> 09:49.180
in face-to-face interactions.

09:49.180 --> 09:52.020
And social media just doesn't, you know,

09:52.020 --> 09:54.940
it doesn't capture that energy in the same way.

09:54.940 --> 09:57.620
And so social media might be an interesting place

09:57.620 --> 10:00.820
for religious groups to post reminders

10:00.820 --> 10:02.300
or, you know, reaffirmations,

10:02.300 --> 10:05.220
but you don't see a lot of online religions

10:05.220 --> 10:09.140
growing very fast, at least not the way you'd expect.

10:10.020 --> 10:12.460
Do you think it's because that the values

10:12.460 --> 10:14.700
within that social context that you mentioned

10:14.700 --> 10:19.700
is defined by very few people, relatively speaking,

10:20.100 --> 10:23.540
who are also practicing their own kind of a religion?

10:23.540 --> 10:26.660
You know, it is not conventional kind of a religion,

10:26.660 --> 10:28.660
but it's a worldview and a philosophy

10:28.660 --> 10:31.220
that determines this is good, this is bad,

10:31.220 --> 10:32.940
this is right, this is wrong, right?

10:32.940 --> 10:36.340
Because that seems to be the main job of the religion,

10:36.340 --> 10:38.780
which by the way, going back to 9-11,

10:39.900 --> 10:42.300
I grew up as a Muslim in Iran.

10:42.300 --> 10:44.940
I went to school as a Shia Muslim.

10:44.940 --> 10:49.020
So my biggest shock when I moved to the West,

10:49.020 --> 10:50.860
first in Canada and then US,

10:50.860 --> 10:52.820
was how people were treating Islam,

10:52.820 --> 10:54.660
because it was very clear to us

10:54.660 --> 10:58.260
that Islam is inherently a political religion.

10:58.260 --> 11:01.180
It is used for political reason,

11:01.180 --> 11:03.660
because it exists for political reason.

11:03.660 --> 11:06.700
So, you know, all those extremes-

11:06.700 --> 11:10.020
I mean, it was born out of political struggle, right?

11:10.020 --> 11:10.860
Absolutely.

11:10.860 --> 11:11.700
I mean, it's-

11:11.700 --> 11:12.980
The book describes it quite clearly.

11:12.980 --> 11:15.220
It's a book of rules and laws

11:15.220 --> 11:18.620
that includes every single aspect of your life,

11:18.620 --> 11:21.900
including how to govern and how to do all of that.

11:21.900 --> 11:23.500
And it's a very big question

11:23.500 --> 11:26.060
how the true followers of that religion

11:26.060 --> 11:28.980
would ever be able to assimilate to Western society,

11:28.980 --> 11:31.860
because they don't care about the laws that are man-made.

11:31.860 --> 11:34.700
They care about the laws of Allah.

11:34.700 --> 11:35.540
Right.

11:35.540 --> 11:37.300
And this is interesting too,

11:37.300 --> 11:42.300
because the separation of religion as a thing, right,

11:44.460 --> 11:46.940
is actually a very new idea.

11:46.940 --> 11:49.500
And it's a very Western idea,

11:49.500 --> 11:51.340
because it's rooted very much

11:51.340 --> 11:53.940
in the idea of a separation of church and state,

11:53.940 --> 11:57.740
which is, you know, not quite even 300 years old yet.

11:57.740 --> 12:00.620
So in the grand scheme of human civilization,

12:00.620 --> 12:04.220
this is like the newest idea that we've had, right,

12:04.220 --> 12:07.020
is to make religion a separate thing.

12:07.020 --> 12:08.500
A lot of cultures throughout the world

12:08.500 --> 12:10.500
don't even have a word for religion.

12:10.500 --> 12:13.580
It's just, that's what they do and what they believe.

12:13.580 --> 12:15.060
It doesn't need a word.

12:15.060 --> 12:17.940
And I think when you look at, you know,

12:17.940 --> 12:20.220
almost any non-Western tradition, but Islam,

12:20.220 --> 12:21.740
definitely being one of them,

12:21.740 --> 12:26.740
the separation of like the secular and the sacred

12:26.900 --> 12:28.660
just doesn't even make sense.

12:28.660 --> 12:31.260
It's just, it's not, it's a non-starter.

12:31.260 --> 12:33.420
That really only exists in the West.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.260
And I think it's something that,

12:36.300 --> 12:38.940
I think it's one of the reasons why the West

12:38.940 --> 12:42.020
has had trouble understanding Islam,

12:42.020 --> 12:45.180
is because, you know, from our perspective, right,

12:45.180 --> 12:47.820
from, you know, the North American perspective, let's say,

12:47.820 --> 12:50.420
or even the European perspective now,

12:50.420 --> 12:52.500
there's very much this idea of like,

12:52.500 --> 12:55.780
well, you know, that's just a religious thing,

12:55.780 --> 12:57.820
but they don't understand that

12:57.820 --> 12:59.740
it's not just a religious thing.

12:59.740 --> 13:01.980
It's actually, it's religion, it's culture.

13:01.980 --> 13:04.820
It's kind of everything about the context.

13:04.820 --> 13:06.900
Exactly, it's a life thing.

13:06.900 --> 13:09.220
And a lot of people don't really understand that,

13:09.220 --> 13:11.380
but it's on the other side of that,

13:11.380 --> 13:15.020
kind of getting back to the comment you made earlier,

13:15.020 --> 13:16.740
one of the things that's interesting about that

13:16.740 --> 13:20.540
is that a lot of times there are people doing things

13:20.540 --> 13:25.460
religiously and they don't see how religious they're being

13:25.460 --> 13:27.020
in a secular space.

13:27.020 --> 13:28.940
And social media is exactly this.

13:28.940 --> 13:33.580
So myself and two of my friends and researchers

13:33.580 --> 13:35.300
that I work with,

13:35.300 --> 13:37.780
Laurent Schulz and Kevin McAfrey,

13:37.780 --> 13:41.220
we studied online behavior on Twitter

13:41.220 --> 13:44.500
using some of the AI systems that I've developed

13:44.500 --> 13:46.900
for analyzing texts on social media

13:46.900 --> 13:49.860
to try and better understand what people's concerns are.

13:49.860 --> 13:51.900
And what we started to find out

13:51.900 --> 13:56.420
is that the moral signature of the far left of Twitter

13:56.420 --> 14:00.540
actually mimics the moral signature that experimentally

14:00.540 --> 14:03.940
is usually more common to conservatives,

14:03.940 --> 14:06.260
particularly conservative religious churches.

14:07.460 --> 14:09.420
And it kind of led us to kind of think,

14:09.420 --> 14:12.780
well, maybe this isn't just an anomaly here,

14:12.780 --> 14:14.740
like theoretically, right?

14:14.740 --> 14:18.180
You have a group of people on the very far left of Twitter

14:19.660 --> 14:23.140
who have certain beliefs that cannot be violated.

14:23.140 --> 14:26.260
And if you do violate them, you should basically be

14:27.860 --> 14:30.660
excommunicated from the community.

14:30.660 --> 14:33.860
Yeah, you should be erased, you should be canceled.

14:33.860 --> 14:36.420
But then if somebody tries to critique

14:36.420 --> 14:38.420
your sort of leadership, right?

14:38.420 --> 14:41.340
Your priesthood, then that can't be tolerated.

14:41.340 --> 14:44.620
And generally, you'll just deny that it's happening

14:44.620 --> 14:46.820
in order to resolve the cognitive dissonance.

14:46.820 --> 14:49.540
And if something bad happens within your group,

14:49.540 --> 14:52.220
you're gonna try and push harder to try and say,

14:52.220 --> 14:54.940
well, even though what's happening

14:54.940 --> 14:57.180
is not right ideologically,

14:57.180 --> 15:00.380
if I can get more people to join my group,

15:00.380 --> 15:02.460
then it justifies my beliefs

15:02.460 --> 15:04.700
and it still makes me look like I'm right.

15:04.700 --> 15:07.380
This is the original research for cognitive dissonance,

15:07.380 --> 15:10.020
which happened in a UFO cult, right?

15:10.020 --> 15:13.940
And that exact idea of like, our leadership is failing us,

15:13.940 --> 15:17.260
but if we get more people to join our side,

15:17.260 --> 15:20.500
then it justifies my belief and my identity

15:20.500 --> 15:23.020
of being part of this political party.

15:23.020 --> 15:24.780
I mean, you see that every four years

15:24.780 --> 15:26.300
in the United States now.

15:26.300 --> 15:29.940
It's almost wild to see if it weren't so scary

15:29.940 --> 15:33.460
to see the way that the political parties in the US

15:33.460 --> 15:38.460
now basically operate as sort of secular religions.

15:38.460 --> 15:41.180
That is very true, and they don't see it as a religion

15:41.180 --> 15:44.460
at all because they're using religion as,

15:44.460 --> 15:47.060
it's so funny, I was telling somebody that religion

15:47.060 --> 15:49.660
by far leftists are being used the same way that,

15:49.660 --> 15:52.100
for example, Israel and America were being used

15:52.100 --> 15:57.100
for Iranian regime to have this ultimate enemy

15:57.900 --> 16:01.660
because of which everything else that you do is justified.

16:01.660 --> 16:06.660
So it just feels like the moment that they managed

16:06.660 --> 16:10.300
to remove that in God we trust from back of the money,

16:10.300 --> 16:14.180
it will be replaced immediately by in the state we trust.

16:14.180 --> 16:17.540
And the value and the religion of state is determined

16:17.540 --> 16:20.740
on the basis of very fundamentalist

16:20.740 --> 16:24.060
and uber conservative kind of religious values

16:24.060 --> 16:25.900
that are secular.

16:25.900 --> 16:30.900
Yeah, it's interesting to reflect on that too, right?

16:31.580 --> 16:34.260
Because even when you look at the political parties

16:34.260 --> 16:37.180
as religions, it's not just a matter of belief too.

16:37.180 --> 16:41.140
Like we have our own rituals, our own secular rituals, right?

16:41.140 --> 16:44.820
Like anyone who looks at the inauguration of a president

16:44.820 --> 16:47.660
can obviously see the ritual that goes there.

16:47.660 --> 16:51.220
When you look at the way that the Senate is,

16:51.220 --> 16:55.580
like the way that the halls are actually set up,

16:55.580 --> 16:57.300
they're set up like churches.

16:57.300 --> 16:58.940
Like all of the people sit in the pew,

16:58.940 --> 17:01.860
the one guy goes to the top pulpit and speaks.

17:01.860 --> 17:04.860
You know, they have like the sort of like, you know,

17:04.860 --> 17:07.500
all of the pomp and circumstance behind them

17:07.500 --> 17:10.340
of whatever altar, whatever sort of structure there is.

17:10.340 --> 17:12.740
And it's, you know, it was deliberately done that way.

17:12.740 --> 17:13.940
I mean, when you go into the,

17:13.940 --> 17:17.020
I think it's the Capitol Rotunda and you look straight up,

17:17.020 --> 17:20.580
it has George Washington being sworn in, right?

17:20.580 --> 17:22.540
And that was done in a very ritualistic way

17:22.540 --> 17:25.700
because they felt it had to be done like a ritual,

17:25.700 --> 17:27.940
but they weren't sure how to do it, right?

17:27.940 --> 17:30.660
So he wore his Freemasons outfit

17:30.660 --> 17:32.060
because there were already,

17:32.060 --> 17:34.420
there's an entire ritual structure to Freemasonry.

17:34.420 --> 17:36.220
And he went, well, I don't have any better ideas.

17:36.220 --> 17:38.100
So everyone that was there was kind of, you know,

17:38.100 --> 17:39.620
they were in Freemasonry as well.

17:39.620 --> 17:43.220
So they just kind of did this Masonic-like ritual

17:43.220 --> 17:45.700
to be part of the inauguration.

17:45.700 --> 17:48.340
The Bible that they swore him in on, if I'm not mistaken,

17:48.340 --> 17:50.820
was actually a Bible from the local

17:50.820 --> 17:52.780
Freemasonry Lodge as well.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.900
And so it kind of reflected this idea

17:54.900 --> 17:57.460
that they needed ritual there.

17:57.460 --> 18:02.060
And the, if I'm not mistaken, the title of that work of art

18:02.060 --> 18:03.620
in the Capitol Rotunda is called

18:03.620 --> 18:06.020
the Apotheosis of Washington, right?

18:06.020 --> 18:08.060
Which is, you know, the becoming,

18:08.060 --> 18:11.700
the man becoming God is basically

18:11.700 --> 18:14.300
how you could translate that in Greek, right?

18:14.300 --> 18:19.300
And Washington does exist kind of as a quasi deity in a way.

18:21.020 --> 18:24.140
And what I find interesting and very frightening

18:24.140 --> 18:26.820
is that in the U.S. now, you know,

18:26.820 --> 18:31.020
our founding fathers were always well-respected,

18:31.020 --> 18:33.740
you know, if not kind of quasi-ideified,

18:33.740 --> 18:35.300
at least in a secular sense,

18:35.300 --> 18:37.740
not in a sort of faith or real religion sense.

18:38.700 --> 18:41.580
But now we no longer agree in the United States

18:41.580 --> 18:44.380
that the founding fathers are to be venerated

18:44.380 --> 18:45.900
or are to be even respected.

18:45.900 --> 18:46.980
And in some cases, you know,

18:46.980 --> 18:49.620
we're actively taking down statues of the founding fathers

18:49.620 --> 18:52.420
and people are arguing that even like,

18:52.420 --> 18:55.620
people as important as Abraham Lincoln

18:55.620 --> 19:00.620
should be kind of re-edited into a modern lens.

19:00.780 --> 19:03.340
And I, that is something that's very troubling

19:03.340 --> 19:07.340
because when you look at how schisms start in religions,

19:07.340 --> 19:12.340
that's one of the main causes is people disagree on,

19:12.500 --> 19:15.200
you know, the role of a founder.

19:16.140 --> 19:18.900
And that is what can make or break,

19:18.900 --> 19:20.860
you know, just about any religion.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.620
And you can even see that in

19:22.620 --> 19:25.220
how Protestantism split from Catholicism.

19:25.220 --> 19:28.340
You can see it also in the Sunni-Shia split historically

19:28.340 --> 19:31.260
as well had to do with, you know, leadership

19:31.260 --> 19:36.060
and who had sort of the right lineage at the right times.

19:36.060 --> 19:37.860
You see the same thing in Buddhism as well.

19:37.860 --> 19:40.500
Almost every major religion can,

19:40.500 --> 19:43.120
if there's been a split or if there are multiple branches,

19:43.120 --> 19:45.780
you can trace those multiple branches to an argument

19:45.780 --> 19:48.460
over the lineage and over the founders.

19:48.460 --> 19:51.300
Yeah, I was going to say that bringing down the statues

19:51.300 --> 19:53.140
of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln,

19:53.140 --> 19:55.700
I see literally no difference between that

19:55.700 --> 20:00.700
and Taliban exploding the Buddha statues in Bamiyan

20:00.860 --> 20:04.980
because it's about the status quo, it's about the ethos.

20:04.980 --> 20:08.180
And so it makes total sense that the American religion

20:08.180 --> 20:11.660
or American Dharma, as Steve Bannon put it,

20:11.660 --> 20:14.060
is being challenged by the woke Dharma

20:14.060 --> 20:15.980
and the woke religion.

20:15.980 --> 20:20.980
Yeah, and in a way, I mean, sadly,

20:21.940 --> 20:24.060
I wish it were more complex and to an extent,

20:24.060 --> 20:26.740
I guess it's more complex than what I'm about to say,

20:26.740 --> 20:29.740
obviously, but heuristically speaking,

20:29.740 --> 20:32.340
it does make sense to kind of say that, you know,

20:32.340 --> 20:35.260
there's the American identity

20:35.260 --> 20:37.220
and then there's the woke identity.

20:37.220 --> 20:40.900
And currently the woke identity is anti-American.

20:40.900 --> 20:43.100
It doesn't stand for American values.

20:43.100 --> 20:46.700
It is, you know, when you look at Antifa protests

20:46.700 --> 20:48.300
and Antifa riots, you know,

20:48.300 --> 20:50.740
they're burning American symbols,

20:50.740 --> 20:53.900
they're spinning, they're burning the American flag

20:54.820 --> 20:56.820
and they're doing that and they know exactly

20:56.820 --> 20:58.540
what they're doing when they do it, right?

20:58.540 --> 21:02.900
They're arguing that, what was it, New York City,

21:02.900 --> 21:04.980
I think it was, just took Thomas Jefferson

21:04.980 --> 21:05.820
out of the city hall.

21:05.820 --> 21:06.900
Yes.

21:06.900 --> 21:10.660
Like these events are symbolic,

21:10.660 --> 21:14.500
but they're very real when it comes

21:14.500 --> 21:16.580
to constructing an identity.

21:16.580 --> 21:19.900
And I think one of the ways that you see this

21:19.900 --> 21:21.540
is it starts as a slippery slope

21:21.540 --> 21:22.900
and then it happens quickly.

21:22.900 --> 21:25.260
Historically speaking, when you look at, you know,

21:25.260 --> 21:27.460
moves like this and shifts like this,

21:27.460 --> 21:30.300
it starts slow and then it starts fast

21:30.300 --> 21:31.460
and then it ends fast.

21:32.900 --> 21:34.300
But also you see this, you know,

21:34.300 --> 21:35.980
as part of the slow start, I think,

21:35.980 --> 21:38.900
was getting rid of the Pledge of Allegiance in schools.

21:38.900 --> 21:40.540
I think that that's one of those things, you know,

21:40.540 --> 21:42.180
I had a very good friend growing up

21:42.180 --> 21:43.220
who was a Jehovah's Witness

21:43.220 --> 21:44.660
and he claimed a religious exemption

21:44.660 --> 21:46.420
and he wouldn't stand for the pledge.

21:46.420 --> 21:48.260
And I don't have any problem with that.

21:48.260 --> 21:50.020
If that's a religious exemption, that's fine.

21:50.020 --> 21:53.660
But as a society, you know, the bulk of us,

21:53.660 --> 21:57.220
the most of us should have something that we do

21:57.220 --> 22:01.780
that repeats and reaffirms our identity as a people.

22:01.780 --> 22:04.980
And every people should have that, right?

22:04.980 --> 22:07.060
Because it helps them to create their identity.

22:07.060 --> 22:09.940
And people who have stronger identities

22:09.940 --> 22:11.340
are generally happier, right?

22:11.340 --> 22:14.740
If, you know, you get into a situation and times are tough,

22:14.740 --> 22:16.660
you know that you have people in your group

22:16.660 --> 22:18.180
that can help you out.

22:18.180 --> 22:20.940
You know, you have common experiences, common beliefs

22:20.940 --> 22:23.980
and the reaffirmation of something like this,

22:23.980 --> 22:25.260
the Pledge of Allegiance,

22:25.260 --> 22:28.500
very much functioned to do that psychologically

22:28.500 --> 22:31.700
for a very long time, even though, you know,

22:31.700 --> 22:34.140
we did change the Pledge of Allegiance

22:34.140 --> 22:35.380
at a certain point, right?

22:35.380 --> 22:38.460
And added in God we trust on our currency at a certain point

22:38.460 --> 22:41.100
to reflect that our identity was different

22:41.100 --> 22:44.860
than the rise in the communist identity during the Cold War.

22:44.860 --> 22:47.860
So it had its particular function, historically speaking.

22:47.860 --> 22:51.340
But at the same time, you know, we can change those words.

22:51.340 --> 22:54.300
What's important is that those words reflect core values,

22:54.300 --> 22:56.620
though, and that they're repeated often enough

22:56.620 --> 22:59.100
that we all know where we all stand.

22:59.100 --> 23:02.460
Yeah, a common big picture to strive towards,

23:02.460 --> 23:06.060
to give meaning to this experience that you're having,

23:06.060 --> 23:08.700
you know, otherwise, what's the difference of being anywhere?

23:08.700 --> 23:12.300
You know, it's- Exactly, exactly.

23:12.300 --> 23:16.780
And you see this in some of the thought leadership

23:16.780 --> 23:20.300
on the woke side of the United States right now,

23:20.300 --> 23:23.500
where in the past, you know, free markets,

23:23.500 --> 23:27.300
freedom of expression, you know, free speech,

23:27.300 --> 23:30.540
these were certain rights that were just fundamental

23:30.540 --> 23:32.260
to the American belief, you know,

23:32.260 --> 23:35.060
we can disagree on different things, you know,

23:35.060 --> 23:36.580
we don't have to be the same religion

23:36.580 --> 23:38.060
or like the same kind of drinks,

23:38.060 --> 23:40.780
or even drinker, drink beer, not drink beer,

23:40.780 --> 23:42.900
or whatever it is, those are just details.

23:42.900 --> 23:45.420
Even vote Republican or Democrat or third party,

23:45.420 --> 23:46.580
those were kind of details,

23:46.580 --> 23:50.580
because we all agree things like free speech,

23:50.580 --> 23:54.020
freedom of association, you know, a free press,

23:54.020 --> 23:56.660
like, you know, help, and then little things too,

23:56.660 --> 23:59.020
like helping your neighbor, right?

23:59.020 --> 24:00.940
You know, being someone that you can rely on,

24:00.940 --> 24:03.620
respecting your elders, giving up your seat on the bus

24:03.620 --> 24:05.180
when somebody needs it, like,

24:05.180 --> 24:07.020
there were these little cultural things

24:07.020 --> 24:09.340
that kind of built up, you know,

24:09.340 --> 24:14.340
who Americans were as an identity and as a people.

24:16.020 --> 24:18.540
And those things, a lot of them have come

24:18.540 --> 24:21.900
under attack quite directly, you know,

24:21.900 --> 24:24.740
some of the woke leadership, you know,

24:24.740 --> 24:27.860
I was watching an interview on Democracy Now,

24:27.860 --> 24:31.380
not that long ago, with Ibram X. Kendi,

24:31.380 --> 24:34.660
who was at Boston University at the same time I was,

24:34.660 --> 24:38.020
actually, or he still is there.

24:38.020 --> 24:41.740
And he mentioned that to be anti-racist, right?

24:41.740 --> 24:45.780
Which was his, like, neologism to try

24:45.780 --> 24:49.460
and kind of create a mental gymnastics leap.

24:49.460 --> 24:50.300
For racism.

24:50.300 --> 24:52.820
In his books, yeah, for racism, right?

24:52.820 --> 24:55.300
It's basically to be anti-racist is to be racist,

24:55.300 --> 24:56.700
but a different kind.

24:56.700 --> 24:59.700
And it's a kind that he thinks is a good kind of racism,

24:59.700 --> 25:03.020
which boggles my mind, right?

25:03.020 --> 25:05.220
When I was at Boston University,

25:05.220 --> 25:07.860
my office was in the School of Religion and Theology,

25:07.860 --> 25:11.340
which is the school that granted Dr. Martin Luther King

25:11.340 --> 25:13.540
his doctorate.

25:13.540 --> 25:15.340
And at that same university now,

25:15.340 --> 25:17.700
there is a man who is perpetuating racism

25:17.700 --> 25:20.100
under the guise of equity and inclusion,

25:20.100 --> 25:22.420
and just kind of spinning on the greatest speeches

25:22.420 --> 25:24.020
and teachings that Martin Luther King

25:24.020 --> 25:25.740
ever gave the United States.

25:25.740 --> 25:27.580
And that just blew my mind.

25:27.580 --> 25:31.460
It made me very uncomfortable to be there at the university.

25:31.460 --> 25:34.540
And it made a lot of the students uncomfortable as well.

25:34.540 --> 25:36.300
I got very close with some of the students

25:36.300 --> 25:40.260
who were not okay with the woke direction

25:40.260 --> 25:41.540
the university was going with.

25:41.540 --> 25:42.900
One of them is Joe Allen,

25:42.900 --> 25:45.740
who's now a correspondent for Steve Bannon on The War Room.

25:47.180 --> 25:49.940
Joe's still a good friend of mine to this day, actually.

25:49.940 --> 25:51.460
We disagree about a lot of stuff,

25:51.460 --> 25:53.740
but we respect each other.

25:53.740 --> 25:55.140
We know that at the end of the day,

25:55.140 --> 25:56.860
we have those core values, right?

25:56.860 --> 26:00.660
So when he and I go back and forth on AI and transhumanism,

26:00.660 --> 26:01.940
we really get arguing,

26:01.940 --> 26:04.460
but we do it out of a place of respect.

26:04.460 --> 26:06.340
And at the end of it, we both know

26:06.340 --> 26:10.300
that we're still gonna have a cheers of our beer

26:10.300 --> 26:11.860
at the end of the conversation,

26:11.860 --> 26:13.380
and everything's gonna be fine,

26:13.380 --> 26:16.140
because we know that those fundamental core values are there,

26:16.140 --> 26:18.060
and those are the guiding lights.

26:18.060 --> 26:20.380
The debates are just how we kind of take turns

26:20.380 --> 26:22.220
to right the ship as we move forward.

26:22.220 --> 26:24.220
But I think we can't have progress

26:24.220 --> 26:27.300
without those fundamental values being there.

26:27.300 --> 26:29.940
Ibram X. Kendi on Democracy Now recently said

26:29.940 --> 26:33.460
that to be anti-racist is to be anti-capitalist.

26:33.460 --> 26:36.420
And the repercussions of that,

26:36.420 --> 26:38.580
particularly in light of the leadership

26:38.580 --> 26:40.060
of the Black Lives Matter movement,

26:40.060 --> 26:42.780
saying that they have an ideology,

26:42.780 --> 26:45.660
and they are trained Marxists,

26:45.660 --> 26:48.700
and the relationship between wokeism

26:48.700 --> 26:53.020
and social justice warrior terms and neo-Marxist terms,

26:53.020 --> 26:53.940
being very clear.

26:53.940 --> 26:56.300
And we've spelled this out actually in research

26:56.300 --> 26:58.900
that we've published online as well,

26:58.900 --> 27:02.580
showing not only using an analysis of Google Books,

27:02.580 --> 27:04.740
which is the largest corpus that's digitized

27:04.740 --> 27:06.580
in the history of humankind,

27:06.580 --> 27:10.100
we also were following Twitter conversations online.

27:10.100 --> 27:13.820
And we were finding that you do still see this relationship

27:13.820 --> 27:16.060
between the sort of like neo-Marxist ideology

27:16.060 --> 27:17.460
and the social justice worship,

27:17.460 --> 27:19.380
taking off slowly from the 80s,

27:19.380 --> 27:22.940
and then really propelling exponentially

27:22.940 --> 27:24.900
into the 2000s.

27:24.900 --> 27:26.820
And these things are all related.

27:26.820 --> 27:29.460
And I think that's what's really defining

27:29.460 --> 27:31.460
the rhetoric of the left.

27:31.460 --> 27:33.900
And it worries me because that's the dominant rhetoric

27:33.900 --> 27:35.500
on social media.

27:35.500 --> 27:39.060
And ideally social media is a place for all of us to speak

27:39.060 --> 27:42.380
and for all of us to kind of have our discussions,

27:42.380 --> 27:43.820
even if we disagree.

27:43.820 --> 27:47.940
But what we're seeing now is a partitioning of social media,

27:47.940 --> 27:50.340
or what we've seen recently is a partitioning

27:50.340 --> 27:53.300
of social media, of the Twitter and the Facebooks,

27:54.140 --> 27:56.820
and then your alternatives, right?

27:56.820 --> 28:00.420
Like Minds, Getter, Parler, and the other.

28:00.420 --> 28:04.620
And I don't, I mean, I support those

28:04.620 --> 28:05.980
alternative social media sites.

28:05.980 --> 28:08.140
I have accounts on most of them,

28:08.140 --> 28:09.740
and I use them of different levels.

28:09.740 --> 28:11.740
I use them all more than I use Facebook

28:11.740 --> 28:13.180
and more than I use Twitter.

28:14.300 --> 28:17.540
But I think that we need to have a common dialogue.

28:17.540 --> 28:20.540
And Reddit has a lot of different people there.

28:20.540 --> 28:22.460
It has a lot of diversity of thought.

28:23.740 --> 28:25.940
But it also has a censorship issue, in my opinion.

28:25.940 --> 28:28.380
They're too quick to censor.

28:28.380 --> 28:32.180
So we're at the point that our digital and our analog,

28:32.180 --> 28:35.820
online and offline lives are suffering,

28:35.820 --> 28:39.260
if we wanna use that term, from the same kind of gridlocks,

28:39.260 --> 28:41.860
that they all go back to monopolization

28:41.860 --> 28:43.420
of values and ideas.

28:43.420 --> 28:45.620
Would that be fair to say?

28:45.620 --> 28:48.220
Yeah, I would say that like, yeah, the monopolization

28:48.220 --> 28:51.980
of values and ideas is really unhealthy socially.

28:51.980 --> 28:55.100
And social media kind of, I mean, the foundation

28:55.100 --> 28:57.500
of it offline has existed for a little while,

28:57.500 --> 29:00.260
but it was kind of, you know, it was a little bit here

29:00.260 --> 29:02.260
and there in the media.

29:02.260 --> 29:06.700
But now, recently, it has been just, you know,

29:06.700 --> 29:08.380
it hits us over the head every day.

29:08.380 --> 29:10.300
One of the things that we found in our research,

29:10.300 --> 29:12.780
and I gave a talk about this recently,

29:12.780 --> 29:16.340
the talk's actually on YouTube, in Cyprus,

29:16.340 --> 29:19.340
at the Reflect Festival in October,

29:19.340 --> 29:22.300
I presented some interesting research that shows

29:22.300 --> 29:25.740
that when you look at crime rates in America

29:25.740 --> 29:28.060
and perceived crime rates in America,

29:28.060 --> 29:29.380
so the actual crime rates,

29:29.380 --> 29:32.260
and then how people think the crime rates going,

29:32.260 --> 29:34.580
they basically, like, they have data going back

29:34.580 --> 29:36.220
to like the eighties and the nineties.

29:36.220 --> 29:38.020
And so it basically kind of keeps going down

29:38.020 --> 29:39.180
and down and down, and it's true,

29:39.180 --> 29:41.060
both the crime rate was going down,

29:41.060 --> 29:43.140
it's been going down for decades

29:43.140 --> 29:45.220
when you look at the general trend.

29:45.220 --> 29:46.780
But it goes down and then all of a sudden,

29:46.780 --> 29:47.900
there's a divergence,

29:47.900 --> 29:50.100
where the crime rate keeps going down,

29:50.100 --> 29:53.620
but the perceived crime rate starts to go up.

29:54.500 --> 29:57.820
And when you look at when this divergence happens,

29:57.820 --> 30:01.020
the divergence keeps getting greater and greater and greater

30:01.020 --> 30:03.820
between actual crime rates and perceived crime rates

30:03.820 --> 30:06.060
as adoption of broadband internet

30:06.060 --> 30:08.260
in the United States starts to go up,

30:08.260 --> 30:10.060
and the rise of social media usage

30:10.060 --> 30:12.140
starts to go up in the United States.

30:12.140 --> 30:15.580
That's one of the things where it's just a very clear tale

30:15.580 --> 30:19.780
of that constant media stream

30:19.780 --> 30:21.940
with algorithms that are perpetuating

30:21.940 --> 30:26.940
and promoting the most sensational news, right?

30:27.220 --> 30:29.780
Which is typically violence or instability

30:29.780 --> 30:31.540
or riots or robberies.

30:31.540 --> 30:33.220
These are the things that are gonna get promoted

30:33.220 --> 30:34.380
by these algorithms,

30:34.380 --> 30:35.260
because those are the things

30:35.260 --> 30:36.860
that are gonna get the most engagement

30:36.860 --> 30:38.540
and it's gonna get the most people talking.

30:38.540 --> 30:41.580
And we've suffered in the real world,

30:41.580 --> 30:43.500
psychologically because of it.

30:43.500 --> 30:46.100
And I think that was a very large part

30:46.100 --> 30:49.940
in setting up the context and the motivation

30:49.940 --> 30:52.300
for the riots that we saw in 2000,

30:53.700 --> 30:56.980
where a lot of people were frustrated,

30:56.980 --> 30:59.380
some justifiably so,

30:59.380 --> 31:02.140
and some were just there because they perceived the world

31:02.140 --> 31:04.220
in a way that wasn't true.

31:04.220 --> 31:06.020
You mean 2020?

31:06.020 --> 31:08.260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, 2020.

31:08.260 --> 31:11.380
You know, in 2020 and to an extent, I guess 2021,

31:11.380 --> 31:13.420
but it's really kind of died down recently.

31:13.420 --> 31:18.420
But in 2020, there was a lot of anger

31:18.660 --> 31:21.980
and it was very much being promoted by social media

31:21.980 --> 31:22.860
and the actual media.

31:22.860 --> 31:27.860
I mean, generally I try and follow both sides of the media

31:29.500 --> 31:30.980
to kind of get a sense of what's going on.

31:30.980 --> 31:33.060
And then I have a few sources that I really like

31:33.060 --> 31:35.900
because I think they start from a place of balance.

31:35.900 --> 31:37.060
And then I have a couple that I like

31:37.060 --> 31:38.500
just because they're keeping people in line.

31:38.500 --> 31:40.620
Project Veritas, for example, is one of them.

31:40.620 --> 31:43.100
I follow Project Veritas

31:43.100 --> 31:46.300
and sometimes I don't like the way they frame things

31:46.300 --> 31:47.820
here and there, but on the whole,

31:47.820 --> 31:50.900
I think that he is doing really good work

31:50.900 --> 31:52.940
in exposing a lot of nonsense.

31:52.940 --> 31:56.180
And one of the things that was exposed by Project Veritas

31:56.180 --> 31:58.740
was one of the CNN producers.

31:58.740 --> 32:01.900
You know, and he literally said, if it bleeds, it leads.

32:01.900 --> 32:05.980
And they had the coronavirus infection and body count

32:05.980 --> 32:07.820
going all the way through the election.

32:07.820 --> 32:10.940
And then after the election, it just went away.

32:10.940 --> 32:12.660
The virus didn't go away,

32:12.660 --> 32:15.620
but all of a sudden the media coverage went away.

32:15.620 --> 32:18.700
And now they're caught in between this,

32:18.700 --> 32:21.540
like want to basically propagandize

32:21.540 --> 32:23.900
for the Biden administration at CNN

32:23.900 --> 32:27.020
and make it look like everything's going well

32:27.020 --> 32:28.580
and he's solving the coronavirus problem,

32:28.580 --> 32:30.180
but also kind of push their narrative

32:30.180 --> 32:32.980
that the coronavirus problem is, you know,

32:32.980 --> 32:35.260
getting out of hand and that they need more lockdowns.

32:35.260 --> 32:37.140
And so they're really kind of caught

32:37.140 --> 32:40.020
in an almost Orwellian doublespeak.

32:40.020 --> 32:43.860
It's like, it's almost like watching 1984 unfold,

32:43.860 --> 32:47.140
like it was written as a handbook instead of a fiction.

32:47.140 --> 32:51.140
Yeah, so I think a lot of those approaches like,

32:51.140 --> 32:54.780
how can you be that stupid to say fiery, but mostly peaceful?

32:54.780 --> 32:56.300
You know, like, you know.

32:56.300 --> 32:57.140
Right?

32:57.140 --> 33:00.820
It's like, are you, you cannot possibly be that stupid.

33:00.820 --> 33:04.500
So there is a reason, there is an intention behind,

33:04.500 --> 33:08.060
you know, kind of nudging things to the direction

33:08.060 --> 33:11.340
that they want to be led towards their bigger narrative,

33:11.340 --> 33:16.260
which goes back to monopolization of values and ideals

33:16.260 --> 33:19.500
that are being practiced in a very religious kind of a way.

33:19.500 --> 33:24.020
Now, I want to say that all of this has hyped up perhaps

33:24.020 --> 33:26.820
because of use of computers and use of internet

33:26.820 --> 33:29.340
and more recently use of artificial intelligence

33:29.340 --> 33:33.340
and machine learning, use of modern technology basically,

33:33.340 --> 33:37.300
which is evolving exponentially while we're experiencing

33:37.300 --> 33:39.100
in a very linear kind of a fashion.

33:39.100 --> 33:41.300
So that's why maybe it seems like everything

33:41.300 --> 33:42.780
is getting out of control.

33:42.780 --> 33:44.940
But the problem is that these AI systems

33:44.940 --> 33:46.820
that are now being built and monopolized

33:46.820 --> 33:48.140
by a lot of these people,

33:48.140 --> 33:51.940
they are following the same kind of monopolization

33:51.940 --> 33:54.300
of values and ideals and objectives and goals,

33:54.300 --> 33:57.900
because the same people who have caused these problems,

33:57.900 --> 33:59.380
you know, right now in this world,

33:59.380 --> 34:01.860
they're behind developing these systems

34:01.860 --> 34:05.740
that they can later on use for like a social credit system

34:05.740 --> 34:07.460
and, you know, on and on and on.

34:08.580 --> 34:09.420
Yeah.

34:09.420 --> 34:10.980
I mean, the idea of implementation

34:10.980 --> 34:12.820
of a social credit system is one of the,

34:12.820 --> 34:15.140
in my mind is one of the scariest things

34:15.140 --> 34:17.580
in the AI debate right now.

34:17.580 --> 34:20.940
A lot of AI honestly is useless and unimpressive.

34:20.940 --> 34:23.980
And when you look at really what's being developed out there,

34:23.980 --> 34:25.700
a lot of it's not that interesting.

34:25.700 --> 34:26.860
A lot of it's nonsense.

34:26.860 --> 34:28.420
A lot of it's like, you know,

34:28.420 --> 34:29.860
make your face look like a turtle.

34:29.860 --> 34:31.380
It's just stupid stuff.

34:31.380 --> 34:36.380
But there's certain ideas that are being implemented in,

34:36.580 --> 34:40.300
you know, for example, in China, the social credit system,

34:40.300 --> 34:44.340
it should be the biggest wake-up call

34:44.340 --> 34:49.340
to the West generally that has existed since the 1930s.

34:51.900 --> 34:54.060
And I don't see any other way around it.

34:54.060 --> 34:55.460
And I mean, I almost, you know,

34:55.460 --> 34:57.740
I don't want to come off as hyperbolic,

34:57.740 --> 35:01.140
but when you look at what's going on there in China,

35:01.140 --> 35:04.180
when it comes to the social credit score,

35:04.180 --> 35:06.860
when it comes to, you know,

35:06.860 --> 35:11.100
the concentration camps that they have in Xinjiang,

35:11.100 --> 35:13.100
when it comes to the way they're manipulating the media,

35:13.100 --> 35:14.860
the way they treated the COVID lockdowns

35:14.860 --> 35:16.660
by just welding the doors shut

35:16.660 --> 35:19.100
and just helping people fend for themselves

35:19.100 --> 35:20.820
and then acting like it didn't happen.

35:20.820 --> 35:21.660
And then, you know,

35:21.660 --> 35:23.860
not even to necessarily go down the rabbit hole

35:23.860 --> 35:25.740
that is the lab leak,

35:25.740 --> 35:28.980
but it's just, you look at that and you look at China today

35:28.980 --> 35:32.260
and the way that it's utilizing like child labor in Africa

35:32.260 --> 35:33.660
to monopolize things like

35:33.660 --> 35:36.460
critical rare earth materials and stuff.

35:36.460 --> 35:39.060
It's just, there's nothing going on there

35:39.060 --> 35:43.620
that suggests that this is a peaceful interaction

35:43.620 --> 35:45.740
that we're going to continue to have.

35:45.740 --> 35:49.860
Everything suggests that this is a Cold War scenario

35:49.860 --> 35:52.940
led by a World War II level dictatorship.

35:54.060 --> 35:57.580
Perhaps more dangerous because Nazis could even dream

35:57.580 --> 36:00.540
of, you know, having this level of technology,

36:00.540 --> 36:02.540
this level of tool.

36:02.540 --> 36:04.980
Yeah, I mean, Nazis didn't have the bomb, right?

36:04.980 --> 36:08.740
And China does, you know, they didn't have AI.

36:08.740 --> 36:09.580
When it, you know,

36:09.580 --> 36:11.900
they had to go around and check on people's papers

36:11.900 --> 36:14.260
and they were just looking at people to kind of, you know,

36:14.260 --> 36:15.540
see, oh, do you have your papers?

36:15.540 --> 36:17.300
Are you the right, do you go to a synagogue?

36:17.300 --> 36:19.060
You know, what religion do you have?

36:19.060 --> 36:19.940
What's your last name?

36:19.940 --> 36:20.860
How do you spell it?

36:20.860 --> 36:22.460
You know, do you speak Yiddish?

36:22.460 --> 36:24.620
They were looking at these things

36:24.620 --> 36:26.580
and they were looking for that.

36:26.580 --> 36:28.180
They were looking for all sorts of people, right?

36:28.180 --> 36:30.460
They were looking for the Roma, for the gypsies as well.

36:30.460 --> 36:34.980
And, you know, the gypsies typically have a darker skin tone

36:34.980 --> 36:35.860
in this part of Europe.

36:35.860 --> 36:39.020
So a lot of times they were easy to spot and round up.

36:40.100 --> 36:43.420
But in looking at what China's doing,

36:43.420 --> 36:44.660
I mean, they are using AI

36:44.660 --> 36:46.700
and there are patents that have come forward

36:46.700 --> 36:50.380
that say we can identify Uyghur Muslims.

36:50.380 --> 36:52.300
And then they act like, oh, no, no, well, that's,

36:52.300 --> 36:53.740
we didn't really say that.

36:53.740 --> 36:56.860
And it's like, we saw, you said that.

36:56.860 --> 36:59.380
This is obviously happening.

36:59.380 --> 37:01.260
And these systems are being put into place

37:01.260 --> 37:04.180
where you can just round people up using AI

37:04.180 --> 37:07.540
for saying the wrong thing, for looking the wrong way,

37:07.540 --> 37:09.420
for having the wrong belief.

37:09.420 --> 37:13.060
And I mean, ultimately they're doing to the Uyghurs

37:13.060 --> 37:15.260
what they wished they could have done

37:15.260 --> 37:17.620
to the Tibetans before that.

37:17.620 --> 37:19.140
And it's only a matter of time

37:19.140 --> 37:21.540
before they find someone outside of their border

37:21.540 --> 37:23.780
that's standing in the way of the regime's dominance

37:23.780 --> 37:26.100
of the CCP and they're gonna target them too.

37:26.100 --> 37:28.740
That's the scariest thing, I think.

37:28.740 --> 37:33.100
They already installed automated robots

37:33.100 --> 37:34.940
at the border with India

37:34.940 --> 37:38.660
that they're automatically shooting at Indian soldiers.

37:38.660 --> 37:39.500
So they're using-

37:39.500 --> 37:40.900
I've read reports of this.

37:40.900 --> 37:43.180
They're using all the tools at their disposal

37:43.180 --> 37:45.180
for the objective that they have,

37:45.180 --> 37:47.100
this bigger picture that they have,

37:47.100 --> 37:49.940
point of alignment that is defined by the Communist Party.

37:49.940 --> 37:51.700
And I think this is a point of difference

37:51.700 --> 37:54.020
between me and someone like Joe Allen,

37:54.020 --> 37:56.500
who I had about two hour long conversation

37:56.500 --> 37:59.620
with him on the phone, mostly about AI, I think.

37:59.620 --> 38:02.900
He told me he had a long conversation with you on AI.

38:02.900 --> 38:04.020
And I enjoyed it.

38:04.020 --> 38:05.380
I actually approached him and said,

38:05.380 --> 38:06.860
dude, you're doing a very good job

38:06.860 --> 38:09.180
because these kinds of stuff,

38:09.180 --> 38:11.620
I've talked with a lot of people during this podcast

38:11.620 --> 38:14.500
that politicians aren't even talking about it.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.940
And these are the most consequential things

38:16.940 --> 38:17.980
that are happening.

38:17.980 --> 38:21.340
And the most valid answer I got is that politicians

38:21.340 --> 38:23.500
aren't talking about it because this is not a worry

38:23.500 --> 38:24.620
of their constituents.

38:24.620 --> 38:27.300
Constituents don't even know these things exist

38:27.300 --> 38:28.900
and these things are happening,

38:28.900 --> 38:31.100
which brings an entire issue with

38:31.100 --> 38:34.060
how are we dealing with democracy as a system of governance

38:34.060 --> 38:37.580
when you have a centrally driven monster and dragon

38:37.580 --> 38:39.860
like China on the other side of the equation.

38:39.860 --> 38:44.100
But my point is that we cannot get rid of tools

38:44.100 --> 38:45.300
to defeat tools.

38:45.300 --> 38:48.180
We need to use the tools based on our intention

38:48.180 --> 38:50.260
and our own values and perspective

38:50.260 --> 38:53.180
in order to defeat enemy,

38:53.180 --> 38:56.580
whoever you wanna call it that are using very freely

38:56.580 --> 38:59.580
and openly whatever kind of tool that is available to them.

38:59.580 --> 39:02.300
And I think this is a point that I take part

39:02.300 --> 39:04.100
with a lot of people on the right

39:04.100 --> 39:06.060
who are saying, no, all this technology,

39:06.060 --> 39:07.860
the modern technology, AI and all that,

39:07.860 --> 39:10.060
they're demonic, they're evil, they're satanic.

39:10.060 --> 39:11.500
We shouldn't be using them at all.

39:11.500 --> 39:13.860
They're like, well, you're not gonna survive them.

39:13.860 --> 39:17.740
Yeah, it's funny, cause actually I feel like,

39:17.740 --> 39:19.020
not to talk about Joe when he's not here,

39:19.020 --> 39:20.860
but I feel like Joe kind of struggles with that too.

39:20.860 --> 39:22.540
Cause when he and I talk about that,

39:22.540 --> 39:25.460
he has this kind of tonality to it as if it's like,

39:25.460 --> 39:28.580
this is like a struggle against sort of like,

39:28.580 --> 39:31.740
you know, this almost like demonic technology.

39:31.740 --> 39:34.300
And I don't view it that way at all actually.

39:34.300 --> 39:35.700
I'm very pro technology.

39:35.700 --> 39:37.580
I do think it's a tool

39:37.580 --> 39:39.580
and I think it's a tool that we can use, right?

39:39.580 --> 39:41.260
And so we've been working,

39:41.260 --> 39:45.540
so my company has been working with minds.com.

39:45.540 --> 39:47.460
We started a project about,

39:47.460 --> 39:49.140
I guess it's about a year ago now,

39:50.340 --> 39:53.820
where they basically,

39:53.820 --> 39:57.460
they read a paper that we did on simulating censorship.

39:57.460 --> 40:00.060
And basically our conclusion based on running

40:00.060 --> 40:01.940
20,000 different simulations

40:01.940 --> 40:04.620
of how individuals interact on social networks,

40:04.620 --> 40:06.740
that centralized censorship

40:06.740 --> 40:08.780
actually increases radicalization.

40:08.780 --> 40:12.780
And that allowing people

40:12.780 --> 40:15.100
to just choose with whom they interact

40:15.100 --> 40:16.980
and saying, ah, you know, that guy,

40:16.980 --> 40:20.700
he's being a dick, I'm gonna block him.

40:20.700 --> 40:22.340
And so you just block him

40:22.340 --> 40:25.820
instead of having Facebook come in and remove him entirely,

40:25.820 --> 40:30.020
that centralized censorship increases radicalization,

40:30.020 --> 40:31.900
but the one-to-one censorship

40:31.900 --> 40:35.100
doesn't have the same sort of effect.

40:35.100 --> 40:37.580
So I was speaking with the guys at minds.com

40:37.580 --> 40:41.380
and they're committed to not censoring, right?

40:41.380 --> 40:44.500
Unless it's illegal, they won't censor it.

40:44.500 --> 40:46.420
If it's not safe for work,

40:46.420 --> 40:48.940
they ask you to tag it so you can blur it

40:48.940 --> 40:51.060
so that if you're using minds.com at work,

40:51.060 --> 40:53.900
you don't have something pornographic

40:53.900 --> 40:55.380
scroll up your feed, for example,

40:55.380 --> 40:59.620
like they don't block pornography, right?

40:59.620 --> 41:01.460
It's legal, it can stay on the site.

41:01.460 --> 41:06.420
Just respect others who might be checking this at work

41:06.420 --> 41:09.220
and blur it out for them is what they ask.

41:09.220 --> 41:11.020
And so I really like that approach.

41:11.020 --> 41:12.060
I really support that approach.

41:12.060 --> 41:14.540
I think it aligns with free speech values.

41:14.540 --> 41:18.220
So the question then is how can we also make sure though

41:18.220 --> 41:21.820
that radicalization and hatred don't breed on that site?

41:21.820 --> 41:24.860
And on the one hand, not censoring already helps,

41:24.860 --> 41:26.100
but on the other hand,

41:27.700 --> 41:31.420
what causes radicalization is not using the internet, right?

41:31.420 --> 41:32.860
There's been tons of studies on this

41:32.860 --> 41:34.980
and none of them have really shown

41:34.980 --> 41:37.260
that internet use is a strong predictor

41:37.260 --> 41:39.460
of radicalization or extremism.

41:39.460 --> 41:43.020
What is a predictor are real life experiences.

41:43.020 --> 41:44.500
And what seems to be happening,

41:44.500 --> 41:48.420
particularly with people who are like,

41:48.420 --> 41:50.540
for example, if they're white supremacists

41:50.540 --> 41:52.620
and they are to the point of extremism

41:52.620 --> 41:55.060
where they may commit violence

41:55.060 --> 41:58.860
against another racial community.

41:58.860 --> 42:02.340
What typically has happened is that their understanding

42:02.340 --> 42:05.300
of that racial community just is not realistic at all.

42:05.300 --> 42:07.820
And it's usually because of isolation, right?

42:07.820 --> 42:10.620
They've never actually spoken to someone of another race

42:10.620 --> 42:12.500
or had to interact with them.

42:12.500 --> 42:15.620
And so it allows them to breed hatred.

42:15.620 --> 42:17.860
And I think that's why guys like Daryl Davis

42:17.860 --> 42:20.140
have been so effective in de-radicalization.

42:20.140 --> 42:22.220
Daryl Davis is part of the project with us actually.

42:22.220 --> 42:23.580
Oh, awesome.

42:23.580 --> 42:25.180
Yeah, yeah, he's been great to work with.

42:25.180 --> 42:27.940
So we were working with Daryl Davis

42:27.940 --> 42:31.780
and the late Jesse Morton was also part of this with us.

42:31.780 --> 42:35.780
And we have Bill Ottman, the CEO at Mines

42:35.780 --> 42:38.060
is working with us directly on it,

42:38.060 --> 42:41.180
as is Jack, the COO at Mines.

42:41.180 --> 42:44.020
So it's been a really fun, a really cool project

42:44.020 --> 42:47.060
where we've brought in all kinds of experts globally

42:47.060 --> 42:48.340
on radicalization and said,

42:48.340 --> 42:51.180
look, what are your proposals?

42:51.180 --> 42:53.980
And we hear them out and we just tell them like,

42:53.980 --> 42:55.940
censorship is non-negotiable.

42:55.940 --> 42:57.700
That's not on the table for us.

42:57.700 --> 42:59.180
Like we're gonna figure out

42:59.180 --> 43:01.540
how to address radicalization and extremism,

43:01.540 --> 43:04.020
but we're not gonna sacrifice these core values.

43:04.020 --> 43:06.220
And that's been a really interesting project

43:06.220 --> 43:08.860
because everyone's response in social media is,

43:08.860 --> 43:10.260
just ban them, just get rid of them.

43:10.260 --> 43:13.220
And the issue is that that doesn't solve the problem.

43:13.220 --> 43:16.140
That just makes it so that you don't see the problem.

43:16.140 --> 43:18.460
And that's a very different solution.

43:18.460 --> 43:20.460
Yeah, out of sight, out of mind, they think,

43:20.460 --> 43:24.180
but it'll always come back harder and more extreme.

43:24.180 --> 43:26.900
Like you can't get rid of the information.

43:26.900 --> 43:30.060
Yeah, like one of the things that boggled my mind

43:30.060 --> 43:35.060
was the general media response to like,

43:35.140 --> 43:39.340
what was going on in 2020 and even all the way up

43:39.340 --> 43:43.340
to like the January 6 protests and everything.

43:43.340 --> 43:46.580
It's like, people were so surprised.

43:46.580 --> 43:49.700
And I was like, why are you surprised by this?

43:49.700 --> 43:51.620
You're just not listening.

43:51.620 --> 43:54.380
If you're surprised, you're just not listening.

43:54.380 --> 43:56.260
And I think part of it, and one of the reasons

43:56.260 --> 43:58.500
why I think the January 6 protest

43:58.500 --> 43:59.820
was so surprising to people

43:59.820 --> 44:02.220
is because those were the kinds of voices

44:02.220 --> 44:05.460
that have been algorithmically silenced.

44:05.460 --> 44:09.380
And so people didn't realize how widespread,

44:10.300 --> 44:15.300
not QAnon, not any particular conspiracy theory,

44:16.180 --> 44:20.340
but how widespread frustration with the government system

44:20.340 --> 44:21.620
leading into the election

44:21.620 --> 44:24.620
and then frustration with the election.

44:24.620 --> 44:27.740
And the idea that they did not have a voice heard

44:27.740 --> 44:32.300
in the justice system, that was suppressed online.

44:32.300 --> 44:36.740
So nobody saw it coming when it instantiated itself

44:36.740 --> 44:39.340
the way that it did on January 6.

44:39.340 --> 44:41.740
And that I find very interesting.

44:41.740 --> 44:44.540
Then the media of course has now used this as like impetus

44:44.540 --> 44:47.460
for domestic terrorist reform,

44:47.460 --> 44:50.460
the likes of which we've not seen since 9-11.

44:50.460 --> 44:55.460
And that I find very confusing

44:55.460 --> 44:59.900
from a legal perspective, from a policy perspective.

44:59.900 --> 45:04.900
Because while I agree if a group tries to take over

45:05.100 --> 45:08.380
the Senate during a proceeding,

45:08.380 --> 45:11.060
that is just by letter of the law.

45:11.060 --> 45:15.020
And you look at how the FBI defines what terrorism is,

45:15.020 --> 45:18.820
is basically any sort of use or threat of violence

45:18.820 --> 45:21.380
in order to achieve a political end.

45:21.380 --> 45:22.860
It's a very vague definition,

45:22.860 --> 45:24.860
maybe problematically vague actually.

45:24.860 --> 45:27.100
But if we take that definition,

45:27.100 --> 45:29.500
I can see how you could apply that definition

45:29.500 --> 45:34.500
to a small subset of the people present on January 6.

45:34.820 --> 45:38.140
However, if you apply it to January 6,

45:38.140 --> 45:42.500
but you don't apply it to Antifa in 2020,

45:42.500 --> 45:45.140
it makes me question the extent to which

45:45.140 --> 45:47.780
this is entirely politically motivated.

45:47.780 --> 45:48.620
It is entirely politically motivated.

45:48.620 --> 45:50.540
And not really about its security.

45:50.540 --> 45:52.980
Yeah, and that's the conclusion that I've come to.

45:52.980 --> 45:55.060
And I think that most logical people will come to

45:55.060 --> 45:56.860
as we say, look, here's our measuring stick.

45:56.860 --> 46:00.180
If it fits in this box, we get to call it terrorism.

46:00.180 --> 46:03.300
And they throw January 6, and basically people go,

46:03.300 --> 46:05.980
everyone, and some people say everyone.

46:05.980 --> 46:07.220
And then I go, you're not looking

46:07.220 --> 46:08.260
at what they were doing there.

46:08.260 --> 46:09.940
And then they go, some of them.

46:09.940 --> 46:12.180
And I go, okay, some of them,

46:12.180 --> 46:14.060
I can see how this fits the definition, yes.

46:14.060 --> 46:18.020
And then I would say, okay, insurrections, Antifa, right?

46:18.020 --> 46:19.500
What about Chavez, right?

46:19.500 --> 46:21.540
They declared an independent nation

46:21.540 --> 46:26.020
within the United States, and they took over a courthouse,

46:26.020 --> 46:27.820
which sounds familiar, right?

46:27.820 --> 46:29.540
They took over a government building,

46:29.540 --> 46:31.780
declared an independent nation,

46:31.780 --> 46:36.180
and then guarded it with arms for like a month.

46:36.180 --> 46:39.020
But that wasn't an insurrection or terrorism.

46:39.020 --> 46:42.940
And it just makes me really worried

46:42.940 --> 46:45.580
because the key to stability in a democracy

46:45.580 --> 46:47.700
is an independent judiciary.

46:47.700 --> 46:49.700
And if we don't have an independent judiciary

46:49.700 --> 46:53.820
in the United States, effectively you have regulation

46:53.820 --> 46:57.060
and legislation by the executive, right?

46:57.060 --> 46:58.260
By enforcement.

46:58.260 --> 47:01.340
The law is what the person at the top says what the law is.

47:01.340 --> 47:03.500
And in the US, that person at the top

47:03.500 --> 47:04.820
can change every four years.

47:04.820 --> 47:07.340
That doesn't make for a stable society.

47:07.340 --> 47:09.580
It doesn't make for stable investments.

47:09.580 --> 47:10.740
Like, how can you plan a business

47:10.740 --> 47:11.780
if you don't know if your business

47:11.780 --> 47:13.740
will be legal in four years, right?

47:13.740 --> 47:16.220
And I think the marijuana industry has seen this

47:16.220 --> 47:17.220
in particular, right?

47:17.220 --> 47:22.220
Those guys have struggled, not just socioculturally

47:22.940 --> 47:24.900
about acceptance or not acceptance

47:24.900 --> 47:27.980
or the morality of using or not using marijuana,

47:27.980 --> 47:30.020
but just legally speaking,

47:30.020 --> 47:33.020
those guys don't know whether they're coming or going.

47:33.020 --> 47:33.860
Yeah.

47:33.860 --> 47:36.460
Cryptocurrency also is the same way right now.

47:36.460 --> 47:39.820
Cryptocurrency, which is probably the largest opportunity

47:39.820 --> 47:42.340
and it's probably the biggest wealth transfer

47:42.340 --> 47:46.500
to like the little guy that we've ever seen.

47:46.500 --> 47:50.780
When you look at how many guys got into cryptocurrency

47:50.780 --> 47:53.180
before banks, well, banks were still saying

47:53.180 --> 47:55.220
that it's nonsense and it's a Ponzi scheme

47:55.220 --> 47:56.500
and all this other stuff.

47:56.500 --> 47:58.140
Guys were buying Bitcoin.

47:58.140 --> 48:00.060
And a lot of these guys are just little guys

48:00.060 --> 48:01.460
who now can afford apartments

48:01.460 --> 48:03.060
that they never could have afforded

48:03.060 --> 48:04.860
because they invested in Bitcoin

48:04.860 --> 48:07.780
when Bitcoin was at like, you know, four or 500,

48:07.780 --> 48:09.380
maybe it was at a thousand or 2000.

48:09.380 --> 48:11.740
And now it's sitting at $40,000

48:11.740 --> 48:15.420
and they've outperformed the best hedge funds on Wall Street.

48:15.420 --> 48:17.380
And now of course the SEC wants to come in

48:17.380 --> 48:19.260
and act like they have the authority to regulate.

48:19.260 --> 48:21.500
It's not clear that they do,

48:21.500 --> 48:23.260
but they're gonna regulate by enforcement

48:23.260 --> 48:24.380
and they're gonna say, well,

48:24.380 --> 48:25.540
we're gonna take you to court.

48:25.540 --> 48:28.020
We're gonna sue you and ruin your life and your company.

48:28.020 --> 48:31.260
And then we'll see whether or not you broke the law.

48:31.260 --> 48:32.940
And that's not rule of law.

48:32.940 --> 48:33.780
That's not healthy.

48:33.780 --> 48:36.540
That's, you know, what a dictatorship does.

48:36.540 --> 48:37.580
Yeah, at the same time,

48:37.580 --> 48:39.420
there are people who are running right now

48:39.420 --> 48:41.820
for Senate, Josh Mandel in Ohio

48:41.820 --> 48:44.340
and Blake Masters in Arizona.

48:44.340 --> 48:48.260
They already called for Fort Satoshi Nakamoto

48:48.260 --> 48:51.700
as a new Fort Knox for United States government

48:51.700 --> 48:53.380
to hold Bitcoin.

48:53.380 --> 48:56.740
And you know, this contrast I think exists

48:56.740 --> 48:59.100
exactly because there was a power struggle

48:59.100 --> 49:01.420
for a vacuum that hasn't been created

49:01.420 --> 49:05.460
as a result of four years of maybe five years of Trump,

49:05.460 --> 49:07.700
who I consider to be a psychedelic.

49:07.700 --> 49:09.060
Trump was a psychedelic.

49:09.060 --> 49:10.300
You know, it's like.

49:10.300 --> 49:11.140
I like that.

49:11.140 --> 49:15.460
The entire world tripped on Trump really hard.

49:15.460 --> 49:18.060
And some people have been having very bad trips

49:18.060 --> 49:20.980
because their entire identity and worldview was shattered.

49:20.980 --> 49:23.420
That how is this even possible?

49:23.420 --> 49:24.380
I like that.

49:24.380 --> 49:25.820
I've not thought of it that way before,

49:25.820 --> 49:27.180
but I really like that.

49:27.180 --> 49:29.020
Trump was a trip.

49:29.020 --> 49:31.020
He really was like a psychedelic.

49:31.020 --> 49:32.780
Cause in a way you were like, is this real?

49:32.780 --> 49:36.060
There's aspects of reality to some of these things.

49:36.060 --> 49:37.620
And then some of these things, I don't know.

49:37.620 --> 49:39.780
Some of it was, some of his behavior,

49:39.780 --> 49:42.380
I personally found kind of bizarre.

49:42.380 --> 49:43.220
So I guess.

49:43.220 --> 49:45.980
He also revealed that it doesn't really matter

49:45.980 --> 49:47.260
who's elected president.

49:47.260 --> 49:51.220
There is a class in DC, which I have a friend.

49:51.220 --> 49:52.900
He's a White House correspondent.

49:52.900 --> 49:54.940
He's saying DC is not even America.

49:54.940 --> 49:57.380
You know, it's like an occupied zone basically

49:57.380 --> 50:00.460
by people whose interests is not shared

50:00.460 --> 50:02.300
with absolute majority of American people.

50:02.300 --> 50:03.980
And they've taken over this country.

50:03.980 --> 50:06.340
So absolutely it has everything they're doing.

50:06.340 --> 50:10.380
It has political incentive and political implication,

50:10.380 --> 50:12.060
but I think they've overreached.

50:12.060 --> 50:16.620
And that's like a silver lining in all of this to me,

50:16.620 --> 50:18.540
that they just gone overboard.

50:18.540 --> 50:23.540
That's why they're becoming very overtly coercive

50:24.220 --> 50:25.780
and violent.

50:25.780 --> 50:27.500
And it's just not sustainable, you know,

50:27.500 --> 50:29.620
because United States is not North Korea.

50:30.620 --> 50:31.940
Exactly.

50:31.940 --> 50:34.900
And one of the things that a lot of the work

50:34.900 --> 50:38.060
that I've done in the AI space has allowed me to do

50:38.060 --> 50:43.060
is kind of investigate what causes things to go wrong, right?

50:43.220 --> 50:45.820
What happens when you overly centralize an identity,

50:45.820 --> 50:48.540
when you overly centralize power,

50:48.540 --> 50:51.620
or what happens when you make it like super distributed?

50:51.620 --> 50:55.780
And one of the patterns that we've seen in this research

50:55.780 --> 50:58.700
is that when you overly centralized power

50:58.700 --> 51:01.100
or you overly centralized the culture,

51:01.100 --> 51:06.100
like the cultural permissibility, you end up breaking

51:06.460 --> 51:07.500
the system.

51:07.500 --> 51:10.660
And the fact of the matter is just that, you know,

51:10.660 --> 51:13.020
humans are different, like we're all different.

51:13.020 --> 51:16.220
And that's the cool thing about us actually.

51:16.220 --> 51:18.460
It's what I love the most is, you know,

51:18.460 --> 51:19.980
when I talk to somebody,

51:19.980 --> 51:22.100
you don't know what's gonna happen, right?

51:22.100 --> 51:24.100
They could be end up being your best friend,

51:24.100 --> 51:25.180
or you could just be like,

51:25.180 --> 51:27.580
I didn't like that guy at all, right?

51:27.580 --> 51:30.820
And it's just, that's our beauty.

51:30.820 --> 51:32.540
And that's our curse, right?

51:32.540 --> 51:34.820
Because sometimes we're too different to get along.

51:34.820 --> 51:37.620
And other times we're just different enough to cooperate,

51:37.620 --> 51:39.740
but we're not gonna be friends, but we'll be colleagues,

51:39.740 --> 51:42.420
like, you know, and everything in between.

51:42.420 --> 51:44.940
And when you overly centralized power

51:44.940 --> 51:47.340
to people of a specific kind of belief

51:47.340 --> 51:50.060
or a specific kind of background,

51:50.060 --> 51:52.300
you're always going to neglect the people

51:52.300 --> 51:53.700
that are towards the extremity

51:53.700 --> 51:56.820
of wherever you sit on that spectrum.

51:56.820 --> 52:00.460
And so that is never going to create stability

52:00.460 --> 52:02.140
because eventually everyone else

52:02.140 --> 52:04.140
is gonna start teaming up on you,

52:04.140 --> 52:06.780
and you're going to effectively be an imperialist

52:06.780 --> 52:08.380
within your own country.

52:08.380 --> 52:09.820
And this happens whenever you see

52:09.820 --> 52:11.980
the centralization of power, right?

52:11.980 --> 52:15.900
Every single major historical example

52:15.900 --> 52:19.700
of a complex society that has collapsed,

52:19.700 --> 52:21.780
has collapsed effectively

52:21.780 --> 52:26.780
because it overly centralized economic decision-making

52:26.780 --> 52:30.620
and overly pushed that to deal with problems

52:30.620 --> 52:32.780
that it itself was creating.

52:32.780 --> 52:35.620
So like, for example, in this,

52:35.620 --> 52:36.940
you can actually read the guy

52:36.940 --> 52:39.180
with Cambridge University Press actually published a book

52:39.180 --> 52:40.740
called The Complex of Complexes,

52:40.740 --> 52:42.980
or The Collapse of Complex Societies.

52:42.980 --> 52:44.220
His name's Joseph Tainter.

52:44.220 --> 52:45.620
He's a professor at Utah.

52:46.820 --> 52:50.180
He surveyed over 20 different complex societies

52:50.180 --> 52:52.180
and basically found that what happens

52:52.180 --> 52:56.540
is when a society makes an investment into something,

52:56.540 --> 52:58.380
some problem that it has,

52:59.260 --> 53:02.220
there's an effect of declining marginal returns

53:02.220 --> 53:03.260
in the economic sense.

53:03.260 --> 53:05.100
And basically what that means is that

53:05.100 --> 53:07.380
when you put a dollar in the first time,

53:07.380 --> 53:09.100
you get a dollar out.

53:09.100 --> 53:11.300
But when you put a dollar in the second time,

53:11.300 --> 53:14.180
you only get like 98 cents back out.

53:14.180 --> 53:15.900
And then when you put a dollar in again,

53:15.900 --> 53:17.660
maybe you only get 90 cents out.

53:17.660 --> 53:20.340
And the more money you put into these problems,

53:20.340 --> 53:23.540
the less value you actually get out of it.

53:23.540 --> 53:25.700
And at a certain point,

53:25.700 --> 53:29.140
society, you start putting money into problems

53:29.140 --> 53:32.460
that the problem solvers have created.

53:32.460 --> 53:33.780
And when you get to the point

53:33.780 --> 53:35.460
where you're putting resources,

53:35.460 --> 53:38.180
if it's wood in the Roman Empire,

53:38.180 --> 53:41.060
if it's olive trees in the Greek Empire,

53:41.060 --> 53:43.140
like the Greek Empire was built without wood.

53:43.140 --> 53:44.500
Like a lot of people don't realize

53:44.500 --> 53:47.020
how much wood does not grow in Greece.

53:47.020 --> 53:50.740
So because of that, like they had to rely on trade.

53:50.740 --> 53:52.980
So when they were investing in social problems,

53:52.980 --> 53:55.660
there was a very clear declining marginal return, right?

53:55.660 --> 53:57.820
This works in barter systems.

53:57.820 --> 53:58.980
It works for gold.

53:58.980 --> 54:01.620
It happened to the Mayas and the Incas.

54:01.620 --> 54:04.060
And to an extent, I think we can look at this

54:04.060 --> 54:06.220
also happening in the United States today.

54:06.220 --> 54:08.780
And that's one of the biggest worries that I see.

54:08.780 --> 54:11.020
It happened in the Soviet Union, right?

54:11.020 --> 54:14.100
But at the point in which your government is saying,

54:14.100 --> 54:16.220
oh, this is a problem, I can fix it.

54:16.220 --> 54:17.060
I need some money.

54:17.060 --> 54:18.740
And we go, okay, here's some money and they fix it.

54:18.740 --> 54:21.580
But then later, their fix created a problem

54:21.580 --> 54:23.900
that they then need more money to fix.

54:23.900 --> 54:26.180
We can start to see how our returns

54:26.180 --> 54:27.660
on our tax money investment

54:27.660 --> 54:29.780
are getting lower and lower and lower.

54:29.780 --> 54:32.580
And with a US national debt that gets so high

54:32.580 --> 54:35.980
that it's interest payments alone

54:35.980 --> 54:39.540
are no longer able to be paid, much less the principle.

54:39.540 --> 54:41.140
You start to see how we start to get

54:41.140 --> 54:43.180
into an unsustainable trajectory

54:43.180 --> 54:45.700
where our money is not getting,

54:45.700 --> 54:48.620
it's not solving our problems as a society.

54:48.620 --> 54:51.820
And there's becoming so much of it because of inflation

54:51.820 --> 54:54.780
that it's not even getting us that far anyways.

54:54.780 --> 54:58.300
So between inflation of a debased currency

54:58.300 --> 55:03.300
and overly centralization of decision-making in a society,

55:04.380 --> 55:07.500
that's what really leads to very serious

55:07.500 --> 55:11.420
and systemic issues in societies that otherwise, right?

55:11.420 --> 55:15.300
Like most major empires don't fall because of the military.

55:15.300 --> 55:16.660
They fall internally.

55:16.660 --> 55:19.740
And these are the mechanisms that like some

55:19.740 --> 55:21.780
of the AI systems that we've been studying

55:21.780 --> 55:23.780
are addressing aspects of this.

55:24.660 --> 55:27.300
Different economic models from archeologists

55:27.300 --> 55:28.300
even are seeing this.

55:28.300 --> 55:29.820
And this is a recurrent pattern.

55:29.820 --> 55:33.020
And they say history doesn't repeat itself, it rhymes.

55:33.020 --> 55:36.540
And I worry that this is what we're looking at right now.

55:36.540 --> 55:39.820
And unless we really find a way to kind of get back

55:39.820 --> 55:41.900
to local communities and just address

55:41.900 --> 55:45.020
what the people of the United States are worried about

55:45.020 --> 55:48.140
and not be worried about what the people in DC

55:48.140 --> 55:49.780
are worried about or coastal elites

55:49.780 --> 55:51.780
and cities generally are worried about

55:51.780 --> 55:53.820
and kind of get back to the ground, right?

55:53.820 --> 55:54.940
Get back to the earth.

55:56.660 --> 55:59.740
We're not gonna be dealing with an ideological reality

55:59.740 --> 56:02.140
that can solve the very real problems

56:02.140 --> 56:03.940
that we're gonna face over the next,

56:03.940 --> 56:05.900
let's say 50 to 100 years.

56:06.900 --> 56:10.100
Government justifies its existence as a problem solver.

56:10.100 --> 56:13.060
So solving problems is against the interest

56:13.060 --> 56:14.660
of government's existence.

56:14.660 --> 56:17.460
Because if you solve problem, there is no government.

56:17.460 --> 56:19.220
Right?

56:19.220 --> 56:21.300
I think this is one of the main reasons

56:21.300 --> 56:25.660
why the biggest structural change

56:25.660 --> 56:29.820
that Americans should mandate, right?

56:29.820 --> 56:33.860
Make it a non-negotiable or term limits.

56:33.860 --> 56:35.820
Because, and this actually comes from something

56:35.820 --> 56:37.460
I remember reading from Thomas Jefferson

56:37.460 --> 56:41.500
is that the politician should not be a job,

56:41.500 --> 56:43.740
being a politician should not be a career.

56:43.740 --> 56:46.140
It should be something you don't even want to do, right?

56:46.140 --> 56:48.980
It should be something you're forced or obliged to do

56:48.980 --> 56:52.020
because you feel it is your duty as an American

56:52.020 --> 56:54.420
to be a government servant.

56:54.420 --> 56:57.300
But that through term limits, you're forced

56:57.300 --> 57:00.500
to deal with the reality that you create.

57:00.500 --> 57:03.140
So that if you're a farmer, when you go in,

57:03.140 --> 57:05.700
you got four years, maybe we'll get you six years

57:05.700 --> 57:07.020
in the Senate or something like that.

57:07.020 --> 57:08.260
And then after those six years,

57:08.260 --> 57:10.580
you're gonna go back to farming.

57:10.580 --> 57:13.700
And if you screwed up the country,

57:13.700 --> 57:15.900
it's gonna make your life harder.

57:15.900 --> 57:18.020
What the biggest risk and one of the reasons

57:18.020 --> 57:20.220
why I think we see what we see in America today

57:20.220 --> 57:25.220
is because Nancy Pelosi can get in in 1985

57:25.700 --> 57:29.060
and she doesn't have to do anything except stand up

57:29.060 --> 57:32.740
and say a bunch of nonsense, ruin a bunch of people's lives.

57:32.740 --> 57:37.740
And then she comes out with a net worth of $120 million,

57:38.260 --> 57:40.940
which given taxes, I saw a funny thing,

57:40.940 --> 57:45.940
a napkin calculation that I was doing is that effectively,

57:47.100 --> 57:50.940
if we assume, right, her salary is 233,000 a year.

57:50.940 --> 57:54.840
So if we assume that she lived a very, very,

57:55.700 --> 57:59.820
let's say a life within her means, which she didn't,

57:59.820 --> 58:04.420
and that she invested $100,000 a year on average

58:04.420 --> 58:08.380
since she basically got into politics in like 1987,

58:08.380 --> 58:13.380
then her average returns must have been about 30 to 35%

58:15.940 --> 58:17.540
investing in the market.

58:17.540 --> 58:19.780
It is how she could have had to have made that money.

58:19.780 --> 58:22.120
That makes her the greatest investor

58:22.120 --> 58:23.340
in the history of the country.

58:23.340 --> 58:25.300
Warren Buffett's average annual returns

58:25.300 --> 58:28.020
are about 20% on average a year.

58:28.020 --> 58:30.080
So we need to stop reading Warren Buffett

58:30.080 --> 58:31.800
and we need to choose whatever strategy

58:31.800 --> 58:34.680
Nancy Pelosi has chosen in her investments.

58:34.680 --> 58:37.440
And that I think is interesting question to ask is,

58:37.440 --> 58:39.300
well, if she causes the problems,

58:39.300 --> 58:42.620
if she solves the problems and she contracts the companies

58:42.620 --> 58:46.200
that are going to or are not going to solve these problems,

58:46.200 --> 58:50.180
is it possible that she was doing something

58:50.180 --> 58:51.380
that she shouldn't have been?

58:51.380 --> 58:53.700
And obviously it seems very clear

58:53.700 --> 58:58.060
that she's been insider trading for 35 years,

58:58.060 --> 59:00.560
because otherwise you can't save enough.

59:00.560 --> 59:02.580
It would take her like a thousand years

59:02.580 --> 59:04.660
to save that much money.

59:04.660 --> 59:05.500
It's not a chance.

59:05.500 --> 59:08.020
And the beauty of this era is that the jig is up.

59:08.020 --> 59:10.860
You know, the curtain has fallen.

59:10.860 --> 59:13.260
So we'll see where it leads.

59:13.260 --> 59:15.700
I don't think Nancy Pelosi was an early investor

59:15.700 --> 59:17.420
in Bitcoin or anything like that.

59:17.420 --> 59:19.140
So it's...

59:19.140 --> 59:21.420
Not according to her financial returns.

59:21.420 --> 59:22.260
Maybe she's not.

59:22.260 --> 59:23.740
I mean, is she lying?

59:23.740 --> 59:24.580
I would not be so sure.

59:24.580 --> 59:25.420
Nancy Pelosi lying.

59:25.420 --> 59:27.540
I think the funniest thing about this, right?

59:28.980 --> 59:30.740
I think my favorite thing about the news

59:30.740 --> 59:31.780
that I heard about her recently

59:31.780 --> 59:33.620
is that she's moving to Florida.

59:33.620 --> 59:35.020
Yes, yeah.

59:35.020 --> 59:36.660
So it's like, so she's actually,

59:36.660 --> 59:38.940
she's from Maryland originally.

59:38.940 --> 59:41.900
So she's like from my neck of the woods.

59:41.900 --> 59:44.860
And then she moved out to California basically as,

59:44.860 --> 59:47.220
you know, because her parents

59:47.220 --> 59:48.980
were well connected in politics.

59:48.980 --> 59:50.540
So she gets out to California,

59:50.540 --> 59:53.300
ruins California for 35 years, and then goes,

59:53.300 --> 59:54.140
oh, you know where I'm gonna go?

59:54.140 --> 59:55.380
I'm gonna go to Florida.

59:55.380 --> 59:58.020
Even though she was one of those people

59:58.020 --> 01:00:00.580
that was calling DeSantis basically a murderer

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:01.420
because he wasn't gonna do long-term.

01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:02.260
They all did.

01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:03.100
AOC was here partying.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:05.020
She was calling DeSantis murderer.

01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:05.860
I heard about this.

01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:07.740
Yeah, they were saying, oh, this is murder

01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:09.380
and all that you're killing innocent lives.

01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:11.180
And it's like the first place you guys go

01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:13.380
when you get a chance to go somewhere is there.

01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:16.060
And then AOC got COVID for partying,

01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:17.660
maskless in Florida.

01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:20.180
And she's been awfully silent about it.

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:22.500
And I think that's funny.

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:26.820
But hey, I think AOC revealed something very fundamental

01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:29.020
very early on when she said that

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:31.260
it's more important to be morally right

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:32.860
than factually correct.

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:36.180
And that's all we need to know about how they operate,

01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:37.660
how they see the world.

01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:39.940
And this is my concern

01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:43.980
that the very same people are in charge

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:47.180
of these AI systems that are being built,

01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:52.180
that AI ethics and AI ethicists are hell-bent

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:54.580
on monopolizing them on Google.

01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:56.060
And there's been a civil war going on

01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:58.300
in the Google AI department for a while

01:00:58.300 --> 01:00:59.620
and in many other places.

01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:02.140
So this localization that you're saying politically,

01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:03.900
which is absolutely the way,

01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:06.660
it seems to be the absolutely the way for AI as well

01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:09.820
to decentralize this development of AI

01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:12.700
that even if it's going to lead to AGI,

01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:14.500
which for example, Ben Goertzel believes

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:17.900
that we're gonna reach AGI in like 10 years, 15 years,

01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:21.140
and he's building his singularity net because of that.

01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:23.460
So AGI wouldn't be owned by them.

01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:25.980
Yeah, I'm all in favor of that kind of an approach,

01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:27.860
but it also begs the question

01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:30.740
that how are we going to be decentralized

01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:32.700
yet operating on the basis

01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:34.700
of some kind of a point of alignment,

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:36.860
which goes back to the beginning of our conversation

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:38.380
that there are certain values

01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:42.260
that define the identity of the perspective.

01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:44.500
Exactly, and I do think that that's one of the things

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.420
that Ben's not taking into account.

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:52.220
It's kind of funny, he was at Oxford for a conference.

01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:54.580
He did like the AGI conference,

01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:56.700
global conference was at Oxford while I was there.

01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:59.700
And I got to go out and have a couple of beers with him

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:01.940
and with Dave Hansen as well, who-

01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:02.780
His partner.

01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:03.620
Hansen Robotics.

01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:05.300
Yeah, yeah, they do a lot together.

01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:06.780
They're very like, they're friends.

01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:09.100
They're like honest friends too.

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:10.580
They were very interesting guys as well.

01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:13.580
I had met Dave Hansen before actually

01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:15.100
at the Harrison Institute.

01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:17.180
He was doing some work on BINA-48,

01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:19.940
one of the first like robots that he worked with.

01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:21.820
Martin Rothblatt.

01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:23.140
Yes, yes, exactly.

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:26.060
And so I was there, it's in Vermont.

01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:27.700
So it was actually not far from where I was living

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:30.900
at the time and got to meet them and talk to them.

01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:34.260
And they have a very utopian view,

01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:39.260
which in a way I like their positivity,

01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:44.700
but I do worry that sometimes positivity can lead to naivety.

01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:50.620
And I like the idea of if there is going to be an AGI,

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:55.060
it needs to be decentralized because any centralization,

01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:57.700
like I said before, right, is prone to issues.

01:02:57.700 --> 01:03:02.700
And just like AOC wouldn't want Trump in charge of the AGI,

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:07.140
I wouldn't want AOC in charge of the AI, right?

01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:09.380
You don't have enough natural intelligence, I sure as hell

01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:11.100
don't want you to have the artificial one.

01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:14.900
And that's something I think that's interesting.

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:17.380
And you mentioned Google, for example,

01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:22.340
and Google's big issue in AI ethics recently, right,

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:26.420
hasn't even been, you know, should we build this?

01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:28.900
They just kind of build it and then move on.

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:30.580
There has been some issue with DeepMind.

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:32.540
DeepMind doesn't want to be part of Google anymore.

01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:35.580
And I'm very interested to know more about why that is,

01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:37.020
but not much has come out about it,

01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:39.100
except for the fact that they asked

01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:41.260
to basically be spun out.

01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:45.780
But the biggest AI issue in Google recently

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:48.620
hasn't been mass surveillance, hasn't been data protection,

01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:50.660
hasn't been data ethics, the right to be forgotten

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:51.780
or any of these other things.

01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:54.060
It was Geberu, it was, you know,

01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:57.300
the fact that one of their AI researchers was,

01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:00.020
who has done actually really good work too, by the way,

01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:02.660
like I'm not trying to throw her under the bus.

01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:04.580
I have a lot of respect for some of the work she's done,

01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:08.580
but she did not want to go through a peer reviewed process,

01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:10.100
right, and she said, if you don't,

01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:12.980
if I can't go around this peer review, then I'm resigning.

01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:15.060
And Google said, we accept.

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:16.500
And she said she was fired.

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:17.860
No, she was not fired.

01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:20.220
She resigned, she gave them the ultimatum

01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:23.140
and they called her bluff, I guess.

01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:24.620
But the fact of the matter is that

01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:27.460
that was in a nutshell, right?

01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:30.500
It's better to be morally right than factually correct.

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:31.340
Exactly.

01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:32.180
That's what that was,

01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:35.420
is I don't want to put myself up for critique

01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:38.980
to be shown factually correct,

01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:40.940
which is bizarre to me, right?

01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:43.540
Because one of the findings that like Geberu

01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:44.380
and some of the colleagues

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:46.260
that work on those problems have found, right,

01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:49.820
has to do with like things like gender and racial biases

01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:53.740
in AI and they've mathematically proven

01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:57.300
without a shadow of a doubt that biases exist

01:04:57.300 --> 01:04:59.780
in the way that they've presented them.

01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:02.460
You can't deny, like it's just, it's mathematically provable.

01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:05.300
It's undeniable that those biases exist.

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:08.220
And so for me, it's like, look,

01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:10.460
that it aligns with her ideology.

01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:12.780
She does go more towards the woke side.

01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:14.780
And I think that that's fine, right?

01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:18.420
If there's a systemic bias in our AI,

01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:20.460
we need to either address it

01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:22.620
or know that it exists and be comfortable with it.

01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:23.620
And if we're not comfortable

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:26.940
with certain racial or gender biases,

01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:28.260
many of them there personally,

01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:29.100
I'm not comfortable with them.

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:30.060
I'd like to see them.

01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:33.420
I'd like to see us understand how we can address them

01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:36.380
rather than just going in and addressing them.

01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:38.020
I think we need to raise those questions,

01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:42.860
but saying either you stop asking me these questions

01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:47.340
or I quit, that's not something that I think is very helpful.

01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:49.420
Just criticizing the high priest,

01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:51.740
like exactly what we're talking about.

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:52.580
Yeah, right.

01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:55.980
You can't, or ex-communication befalls you, right?

01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:57.940
And I think this is exactly the kind of thing

01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:02.780
that worries me about the fact that most AI developers

01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:06.580
and most people making big decisions in AI ethics

01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:11.260
come from, I'm not so much worried about left, right,

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:16.260
so much as I'm worried about woke, the woke ideology.

01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:18.340
People will always be more left or more right.

01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:21.860
And it's largely a meaningless designation anyways, right?

01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:23.780
Because for me, I know people who are really far left,

01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:26.060
but they're also anti-authoritarianists.

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:27.660
And I actually get along really well with them

01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:29.940
because fundamentally, I kind of agree with them

01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:31.620
because they're anti-authoritarian.

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:34.940
So whatever nonsense they might believe that I disagree with,

01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:36.300
they're not gonna force it on me.

01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:37.700
And so I'm like, all right, that's cool.

01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:39.220
You do you, I'll do me.

01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:41.620
And the same with people who are on the far right,

01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:43.860
that are further right than I am.

01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:46.580
I, you know, so long as they're not authoritarian,

01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:47.900
I'm okay, it's just a disagreement.

01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:49.140
But the moment they go, oh,

01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:53.140
and I think you should do this too, I get worried.

01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:56.740
And a lot of the people who are on the AI side

01:06:56.740 --> 01:07:00.340
are also saying, and here's what I believe,

01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:03.300
I've designed AI to try and mimic what I believe,

01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:06.740
and I'm going to force this AI to force you

01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:09.820
to conform to my beliefs.

01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:11.780
And the biggest way that that is,

01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:13.980
that's instantiated today, I think,

01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:16.340
is in censorship on social media.

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:20.860
For example, I mean, and some of these are horrendous, right?

01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:25.860
So for example, not being able to even discuss the laptop,

01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:29.700
Hunter Biden's laptop right before the election.

01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:31.740
And oh, it was a bombshell to manipulate the election.

01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:33.660
It was like, yeah, and the entirety of the media

01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:36.820
before then was, you know, no blood on anyone's hands

01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:38.620
on trying to support a candidate before then,

01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:40.380
that's when it started, right?

01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:41.220
It's nonsense.

01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:43.460
Now, all the people who came out,

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:46.220
retired people from intelligence communities

01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:49.860
who signed that letter that this is Russia propaganda.

01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:52.980
So what's going to happen to those people?

01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:54.780
You know, this is a problem.

01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:56.900
Is there going to be any recourse to that?

01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:58.300
I mean, but when you look at what happened

01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:00.180
with the original Russia game, right?

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:02.900
I mean, so much of that was shown to basically,

01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:05.780
and basically in the end, when they investigated it,

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:08.300
the Democrats, you know, the opposition

01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:12.220
looked just as bad or worse than Trump and his crowd.

01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:15.540
If anything, I think it made Trump look rather inept.

01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:18.380
You know, not this grand conspirator.

01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:20.700
He was not the wizard of Oz here.

01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:22.900
You know, he was not the man behind the green curtain.

01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:24.540
If anything, he was kind of, you know,

01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:27.660
the tin man sitting around waiting for everybody else.

01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:31.260
Meanwhile, you see people like, you know,

01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:33.580
Hillary Clinton in the background in her campaign,

01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:35.820
trying to pull all of these little levers,

01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:39.260
and the further we dug into it, the further it looked like

01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:42.460
this was just a lot of nonsense on all sides,

01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:45.660
but this media narrative became unbreakable, right?

01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:48.700
It became like, Russia game became like blue anon.

01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:51.500
It was just like the Democrats' version of the conspiracy

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.980
that the further left you go,

01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:58.460
the more you find it to be an unassailable truth.

01:08:58.460 --> 01:08:59.820
And it was, yeah, it was really,

01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:01.980
it was really worrying, I think, to see that.

01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:05.980
I think, you know, there's a case for moderation

01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:09.660
to be made when we look, and I mean moderation,

01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:11.740
like moderating our own behaviors

01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:13.420
and supports towards social media.

01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:15.820
When you look at the fact that they don't allow us

01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:19.900
to speak about certain things because of a political agenda,

01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:21.660
and then they tell us they're apolitical,

01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:24.620
it's like, don't, you know, don't tell me that.

01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:26.780
Like, it's obviously not true.

01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:29.500
Just be honest, if you're gonna be away,

01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:30.940
just be honest about it.

01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:32.780
Just be honest about it so that I know

01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:34.620
not to use your social media platform

01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:36.180
if you're not gonna allow me

01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:38.340
to participate in a conversation.

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:40.700
And I think, you know, you mentioned earlier, right?

01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:43.260
That having the conversation is critical to democracy

01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:46.060
and people just don't even know about the AI that exists

01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:47.820
and the problems with social media.

01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:49.100
One of the reasons for this

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:51.940
is a very suspicious event that happened, right?

01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:54.900
When Frances Howigan, who previously worked for Facebook,

01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:58.300
released all of these documents as a whistleblower,

01:09:58.300 --> 01:09:59.660
she releases all of these documents.

01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:01.060
It goes onto the Wall Street Journal.

01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:02.660
She ends up appearing before the Senate

01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:03.700
and all of this stuff.

01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:07.580
When those documents were released,

01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:11.340
they were going viral across several social media channels,

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:13.180
but they weren't going viral

01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:15.500
on the largest social media channels

01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:16.820
basically in the world, right?

01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:19.460
Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram,

01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:20.940
because all three of those companies

01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:22.460
are all owned by Facebook.

01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:24.460
Now, since the revelation, right?

01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:25.940
Now they change their name to Meta

01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:27.540
and not Facebook anymore.

01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:31.340
So they're all three being accused

01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:33.500
or it's being demonstrated

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.940
that they knew that they were bad for society.

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:38.340
They knew that they were being politically manipulative

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:41.820
and politically manipulated by external forces.

01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:44.660
And instead of going viral on Facebook,

01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:47.140
all of the Facebook servers just shut down

01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:50.260
for, you know, what was it?

01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:52.100
Eight, 12 hours.

01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:54.660
Now, any social media researcher will tell you

01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:57.220
that when hot news breaks,

01:10:57.220 --> 01:11:00.420
the first six to 12 hours after it's posted

01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:03.420
is critical to determining the amplitude, right?

01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:05.140
How high it will go.

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:06.580
It'll go a little viral,

01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:09.220
but is it gonna go three million viral

01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:11.980
or is it gonna go three billion viral?

01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:14.300
And that Francis Howgood news had the possibility

01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:17.180
to go three billion accounts viral

01:11:17.180 --> 01:11:19.780
across all of the different social media channels.

01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:20.980
But it didn't happen.

01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:22.260
And the reason it didn't happen

01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:25.820
is because somebody made a coding error at Facebook

01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:27.900
at exactly the right time.

01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:30.380
And all of those servers mysteriously went down

01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:32.300
for an unrelated reason.

01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:34.580
And it's like, come on.

01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:37.940
And you see that they'll give you a slap on the wrist

01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:40.260
for questioning about Hunter Biden,

01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:44.220
but they will shut the whole farm down

01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:45.660
if it makes them look bad

01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:48.940
and it exposes what they've knowingly been doing for years.

01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:51.580
Yeah, so more liberty, less secrecy,

01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:54.340
more transparency, less secrecy,

01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:58.220
more decentralization, less centralization.

01:11:58.220 --> 01:11:59.700
A hundred percent, man.

01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:00.980
The world's weird and chaotic.

01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:01.820
Let's love it.

01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:03.420
Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:04.540
Yeah, right with it.

01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:08.620
Unfortunately, we're reaching the end

01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:09.940
because your time is limited

01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:11.620
and I really appreciate this conversation.

01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:12.460
It was awesome.

01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:15.540
Let me ask you the last question I ask all my guests.

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:17.740
If you come across an intelligent alien

01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:19.180
from a different civilization,

01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:22.220
what would you say is the worst thing humanity has done

01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:24.780
and what would you say is their greatest achievement?

01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:28.220
What is the worst thing,

01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:31.660
like single event that humanity has done?

01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:33.660
Or something we built,

01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:35.580
worst and best in humanity.

01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:38.780
The worst and best in humanity.

01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:44.940
Okay, that's a hard one to answer.

01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:46.660
That's a good question.

01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:52.500
So for me, I think that the worst of humanity

01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:56.420
has been embodied historically

01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:58.900
and the biggest threat to humanity

01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:02.180
is also the biggest threat to humanity in the future.

01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:03.900
And that is Marxism.

01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:10.140
That as a ideology, what it's done, right?

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:12.700
It saddens me.

01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:17.260
And then I live in a post-communist country now, right?

01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:19.940
So the Iron Curtain is like 20 minutes from here.

01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:21.820
I can walk along the Iron Curtain

01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:24.580
and they have names of people

01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:26.660
who were literally eaten alive by dogs

01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:28.060
for trying to cross the Iron Curtain

01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:31.060
and just get to Austria to get to their freedom.

01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:32.900
And I've lost track of the number of people

01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:33.740
that I've spoken to here

01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:38.620
that were smuggled out as children to freedom in the West.

01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:41.580
And so having learned about it is one thing,

01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:43.420
but then having heard the stories of people

01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:45.060
who have lived through it here in Slovakia.

01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:46.900
And as I learned the Slovak language,

01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:49.100
I can talk to the older generation, right?

01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:50.620
Who couldn't learn English, right?

01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:52.580
And I get to hear their stories and stuff.

01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:57.580
And that is, I think, that's our darkest moment,

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:02.980
I think, is Marxism and communism.

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:04.420
And it's still today.

01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:09.420
Our greatest achievement, our greatest achievement, man,

01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:25.380
in a way, I would say that our greatest achievement

01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:30.380
as a species was probably, is probably the internet.

01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:40.940
Yeah, I would say our greatest achievement is the internet.

01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:45.940
Our finest hour is this massive technological

01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:50.820
ridiculousness that is both beautiful and it's energy

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:53.020
and it's complicated and it's complicated

01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:56.660
beautiful and it's energy and it's communication.

01:14:58.140 --> 01:15:03.140
And my hope is that we realize that no matter

01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:06.820
what it is we create as people,

01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:09.340
and no matter how beautiful something

01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:12.380
like our greatest technologies are,

01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:16.780
nothing is ever going to be better or more beautiful

01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:20.860
than just walking out in the woods

01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:23.340
with your friends and loved ones

01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:25.940
and actually turning the phones off

01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:28.300
and sitting around a bonfire.

01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:30.460
That would be it.

01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:34.220
So maybe my other answer, if I can have two,

01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:37.180
is the greatest achievement humans ever had

01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:39.300
was figuring out how to light a fire.

01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:42.860
That's, I'll keep it with that.

01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:45.620
Beautiful.

01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:50.620
Awesome.

01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:16.860
Thank you.
