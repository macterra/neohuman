00:00.000 --> 00:05.600
If my mind is in part a function of what's going on in the external world already, and

00:05.600 --> 00:10.000
if all these amazing things are happening in the internet and artificial intelligence

00:10.000 --> 00:14.520
and big data, and all of those can be construed as part of my mind.

00:14.520 --> 00:17.920
But furthermore, there are these methods of communication in which I can communicate and

00:17.920 --> 00:21.320
exchange ideas with people like you, right?

00:21.320 --> 00:29.840
I am like very rapidly achieving like higher and higher, I don't know, planes of consciousness

00:29.840 --> 00:36.400
is the right word, but certainly I'm learning a lot more and thinking in ways that I couldn't

00:36.400 --> 00:39.560
imagine thinking earlier, right?

00:39.560 --> 00:46.680
So to me that there are these avenues of sort of naturally growing that are much more interesting

00:46.680 --> 00:55.560
to me than to try and find some sort of imaginary wall to our intelligence or some sort of ceiling

00:55.560 --> 00:59.240
to our intelligence is a better way to put it, which if we could break through that then

00:59.240 --> 01:09.160
we can see the world correctly.

01:09.160 --> 01:15.000
Peter Ladlow, welcome to the 85th episode of New Human Podcast.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Thank you.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
I've been looking forward to this.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Yeah, absolutely.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Likewise.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
And from Mexico.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.360
I am in Mexico, yes.

01:22.360 --> 01:26.200
How are you doing with the pandemic in that part of the world?

01:26.200 --> 01:30.600
You know, they seem to have a better handle on it than we do in the United States.

01:30.600 --> 01:37.600
I mean, like things are really tight here, lots of precautions, people are following

01:37.600 --> 01:38.600
the rules.

01:38.600 --> 01:42.560
So I actually feel safer here than in the United States.

01:42.560 --> 01:43.560
Interesting.

01:43.560 --> 01:49.880
I want to talk a little about, well, before that, let's get to the work you've done,

01:49.880 --> 01:53.000
the lives you've lived and what do you mainly focus on nowadays?

01:53.000 --> 01:58.200
I ask everybody just to establish some kind of a perspective and the context so our audience

01:58.200 --> 02:02.160
know where your thoughts are coming from.

02:02.160 --> 02:05.800
Well, okay, let's start here.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.500
Let's start with graduate school.

02:07.500 --> 02:16.720
So in 1979, I moved to New York to go to grad school in philosophy at Columbia University.

02:16.720 --> 02:24.760
And my thought was I was going to do philosophy of language and I showed up and people were

02:24.760 --> 02:30.920
doing strange things like the philosophers were doing linguistics, by linguistics I mean

02:30.920 --> 02:35.720
linguistics in the sense of Chomsky's program and generative linguistics.

02:35.720 --> 02:42.480
And the linguists in the sort of vicinity were doing philosophy and I thought that was

02:42.480 --> 02:44.080
sort of weird.

02:44.080 --> 02:49.520
And I was a bit distracted from the program and I spent a lot of time downtown because

02:49.520 --> 02:53.800
a very distracting time to be in New York in 1979 when I arrived.

02:53.800 --> 03:01.280
And there was a lot going on and had been going on since like 1977 when punk came and

03:01.280 --> 03:04.400
really the birth of rap was in that period.

03:04.400 --> 03:12.640
But there was a movement that was known then or at least it's known now as No Wave, as

03:12.640 --> 03:15.960
in N-O, No Wave.

03:15.960 --> 03:20.280
And what was going on is that way down in the Lower East Side in Alphabet City, which

03:20.280 --> 03:26.320
at the time was completely bombed out, there were these kids I guess.

03:26.320 --> 03:30.560
And there were a bunch of musicians that decided they wanted to become filmmakers and there

03:30.560 --> 03:35.880
were a bunch of filmmakers that decided they wanted to become musicians.

03:35.880 --> 03:40.120
And so everyone was just doing things they didn't know how to do and the result was fantastic.

03:40.120 --> 03:46.240
So the best example of this is that there was a band that I really liked called Del

03:46.240 --> 03:53.040
Byzantines, Byzantines spelled T-E-N-Z.

03:53.040 --> 03:59.800
And I used to go and watch them a lot and the lead singer slash keyboardist was a guy

03:59.800 --> 04:06.880
by the name of Jim Jarmusch, who we now know as a very famous film director.

04:06.880 --> 04:11.320
I remember when his first movie came out, it was just a little low budget thing called

04:11.320 --> 04:12.720
Permanent Vacation.

04:12.720 --> 04:18.040
This was before his big breakout movie, which was Stranger Than Paradise, I guess.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.400
And it just blew my mind.

04:19.400 --> 04:24.800
I go, wow, that's like Jim Jarmusch, like my hero from Del Byzantines.

04:24.800 --> 04:29.920
And then it was sort of that where I got it that there were these people, everyone was

04:29.920 --> 04:36.560
doing, we have these musicians trying to make movies and filmmakers trying to start bands

04:36.560 --> 04:41.280
and it's not like they were working in a vacuum, they were still surrounded by musicians and

04:41.280 --> 04:43.560
filmmakers and all that stuff.

04:43.560 --> 04:44.560
And so then I got it.

04:44.560 --> 04:49.760
I just said, you know what, I really want to take a deeper dive into linguistics.

04:49.760 --> 04:56.680
And so I applied to go to MIT as a visiting scholar in the linguistics program and I really

04:56.680 --> 04:58.600
got into linguistics when I was there.

04:58.600 --> 05:04.060
I mean, I asked them to put me in housing with linguists or in an office with linguistics

05:04.060 --> 05:05.400
grad students.

05:05.400 --> 05:09.920
And at one point, I went and talked to the chair of the linguistics department.

05:09.920 --> 05:12.000
I said, I am really getting into linguistics.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.920
I'm thinking about like maybe transferring or like after I get my philosophy PhD, maybe

05:16.920 --> 05:19.320
I'll try and get a linguistics PhD.

05:19.320 --> 05:23.360
And he looks at me and goes, well, you're getting a PhD anyway.

05:23.360 --> 05:24.360
What do you care?

05:24.360 --> 05:26.720
It doesn't matter what your PhD says.

05:26.720 --> 05:29.040
If you want to learn linguistics, learn linguistics.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.440
That's it.

05:30.440 --> 05:31.440
And no one cares.

05:31.440 --> 05:32.800
I mean, linguists don't care.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.920
No one cares if your PhD is in philosophy or whatever.

05:35.920 --> 05:38.240
You just do linguistics.

05:38.240 --> 05:45.640
And that came as a kind of a revelation to me and it fueled subsequent work, which was

05:45.640 --> 05:51.280
often work that was not in my official area of expertise.

05:51.280 --> 05:59.200
So my first job out of grad school was in an artificial intelligence group at Honeywell.

05:59.200 --> 06:01.520
What year was this?

06:01.520 --> 06:08.280
So let's see, that would have been 1985, 86.

06:08.280 --> 06:11.640
It was the intelligent interface systems group at Honeywell.

06:11.640 --> 06:15.840
And those were the very early days.

06:15.840 --> 06:20.120
It was really the second iteration of artificial intelligence.

06:20.120 --> 06:23.720
And that was sort of interesting.

06:23.720 --> 06:27.920
And then I was offered a job in philosophy.

06:27.920 --> 06:28.920
Many things happened.

06:28.920 --> 06:29.920
I was offered a job in philosophy.

06:29.920 --> 06:32.920
I took it.

06:32.920 --> 06:35.080
But I retained interest in other things.

06:35.080 --> 06:42.240
And one of the very early things I was interested in was what was then becoming the internet.

06:42.240 --> 06:44.800
I mean, it was very early stages.

06:44.800 --> 06:50.320
And I edited a collection for MIT Press called High Noon on the Electronic Frontier.

06:50.320 --> 06:56.280
And that covered a number of conceptual issues that were already coming into place.

06:56.280 --> 07:00.840
One set of those issues had to do with cryptoanarchy, which I guess is something you want to talk

07:00.840 --> 07:03.560
about a little bit.

07:03.560 --> 07:10.280
And then a few years after that, right around 1999, I assembled the second collection, which

07:10.280 --> 07:14.960
was titled Cryptoanarchy Cyber States and Pyro Utopias.

07:14.960 --> 07:20.400
And while the first collection was very successful, the second one was not, or at least it was

07:20.400 --> 07:28.360
not successful until now, like 20 years later.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.360
Way ahead of its time.

07:29.360 --> 07:34.240
Well, I don't know if it was that or what it was.

07:34.240 --> 07:37.680
Yeah, I don't know what that was.

07:37.680 --> 07:47.240
So it's very interesting that after all these years, that project is getting some uptake.

07:47.240 --> 07:53.240
And I think a lot of it is fueled by what we see going on with cryptocurrencies and

07:53.240 --> 07:56.520
decentralized finance and things like that.

07:56.520 --> 07:57.520
And that's been it.

07:57.520 --> 08:01.200
I mean, right now, I'm involved in two different projects.

08:01.200 --> 08:05.000
One of them is kind of straight philosophical.

08:05.000 --> 08:11.720
That's a project where I've been looking at some work that the medieval logicians were

08:11.720 --> 08:12.720
doing.

08:12.720 --> 08:17.000
And by medieval logicians, I mean people you've probably heard of, like William of Ockham.

08:17.000 --> 08:23.600
He of the Razor and Abelard, he of the romance with Heloise.

08:23.600 --> 08:29.840
And they had this really interesting project, which was, they wanted to take, well, first

08:29.840 --> 08:36.400
of all, I mean, preface this by saying, you know, there's this myth about medieval logic,

08:36.400 --> 08:41.680
which is that they weren't doing anything except singing peons to Aristotle or something.

08:41.680 --> 08:46.040
And this is a myth that was perpetuated by people like Kant and Wittgenstein.

08:46.040 --> 08:47.280
But it's a complete myth.

08:47.280 --> 08:52.840
And what these guys were doing is they wanted to take Aristotle's logic, expand the scope

08:52.840 --> 08:56.600
to cover basically any sort of language that you use, and then they were going to take

08:56.600 --> 09:00.240
all of his rules of logic and reduce them down to two basic rules.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.440
I mean, it's like an incredible project.

09:02.440 --> 09:04.560
It's a mind blowing project.

09:04.560 --> 09:09.720
And it ran aground some, I don't know, like 600 years ago because they didn't have the

09:09.720 --> 09:17.160
tools to study language with the kind of fine logical detail that you need to.

09:17.160 --> 09:22.640
But now here we are at the development of lots of work in logic in the 20th century,

09:22.640 --> 09:26.520
and Chomsky showed how you could apply these tools to natural language.

09:26.520 --> 09:31.720
So the idea is that now we have the tools to explore these questions after they've

09:31.720 --> 09:36.240
been dormant for 600 years or so.

09:36.240 --> 09:43.640
And then the other project is I remain very interested in cryptocurrencies, and in particular

09:43.640 --> 09:51.260
a branch of cryptocurrency that's known as decentralized finance or DeFi, where you basically

09:51.260 --> 09:57.880
do all the things that the banking industry and the insurance industry and all those things

09:57.880 --> 10:03.280
that we consider to be part of serious real world finance, the question is whether you

10:03.280 --> 10:12.480
can replicate all of those functions in the cryptocurrency space.

10:12.480 --> 10:19.240
It seems like the beginning of Bitcoin, which now is how many years ago, like 12 years ago,

10:19.240 --> 10:25.960
it kind of introduced some kind of a practicality to the philosophical perspective towards decentralization

10:25.960 --> 10:28.400
and crypto anarchy.

10:28.400 --> 10:34.680
And it kind of blew up because of that, and the context kind of evolved with it, right?

10:34.680 --> 10:35.760
I think that's right.

10:35.760 --> 10:41.080
And I think that goes some ways to explaining why the initial iteration of my book on crypto

10:41.080 --> 10:46.400
anarchy didn't go anywhere, which was there was talk about digital cash in it.

10:46.400 --> 10:50.160
And there were versions of digital cash available.

10:50.160 --> 10:57.160
But they had not solved the big puzzle, which is called the double spending problem.

10:57.160 --> 10:59.120
And it took Satoshi to do that.

10:59.120 --> 11:03.580
And it required a technological breakthrough for it to really be feasible.

11:03.580 --> 11:06.080
And we have that now.

11:06.080 --> 11:10.760
Sorry, I just mute my microphone because of these dogs.

11:10.760 --> 11:14.600
Sometimes it's just I don't even hear them.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.780
Okay, good.

11:16.780 --> 11:23.760
How has the definition of linguistics changed from the time that you've begun up to this

11:23.760 --> 11:24.760
day?

11:24.760 --> 11:30.880
It seems to me that language is becoming such a frontier, because different political sides,

11:30.880 --> 11:35.320
different philosophical perspectives, they're fighting over how to define certain kind of

11:35.320 --> 11:36.320
terms.

11:36.320 --> 11:40.400
Let's say, for example, racism, racism means something to one side and means something

11:40.400 --> 11:41.400
to other sides.

11:41.400 --> 11:45.600
And they're fighting with each other that, for example, America is a racist country.

11:45.600 --> 11:47.040
No, America is not a racist country.

11:47.040 --> 11:52.760
But they're fighting with two complete different definitions of these terms.

11:52.760 --> 11:53.760
Yeah.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.480
No, that's exactly right.

11:55.480 --> 11:59.560
Actually, I have a book on that that came out a couple years ago.

11:59.560 --> 12:03.400
And it was called Living Words.

12:03.400 --> 12:08.120
And it was, I had some subtitle for it, but now I'm forgetting what the subtitle of my

12:08.120 --> 12:09.120
own book was.

12:09.120 --> 12:12.120
It was called Living Words.

12:12.120 --> 12:15.520
Wow, that's terrible.

12:15.520 --> 12:18.080
You don't even remember the title of your own book.

12:18.080 --> 12:21.120
I can tell you what it says.

12:21.120 --> 12:26.560
So the basic idea is that you don't really learn a language.

12:26.560 --> 12:34.000
It's not this thing that you sort of just take on full stop, but rather what we do is

12:34.000 --> 12:36.220
we build little micro languages together.

12:36.220 --> 12:40.800
So right now, you and I and your listeners are constructing a conversation together.

12:40.800 --> 12:42.200
We're going to introduce terms.

12:42.200 --> 12:45.160
We're going to get to understand each other better.

12:45.160 --> 12:50.400
And the idea is that it's what I called in the book, and presumably this is part of the

12:50.400 --> 12:56.960
subtitle, the dynamic lexicon is what I called it, meaning that word meanings are very malleable.

12:56.960 --> 12:58.200
They're living words.

12:58.200 --> 13:00.880
And so we have to think of them that way.

13:00.880 --> 13:05.720
And then a lot of what we do in a conversation is not, I have something to say, I'm going

13:05.720 --> 13:12.480
to say it, you're going to hear it, but rather we're engaged in this process in which we're

13:12.480 --> 13:17.240
shaping the meanings of the words that we're going to deploy with each other.

13:17.240 --> 13:21.880
So a lot of conversation that takes place is not here's some information, now you have

13:21.880 --> 13:26.440
it, but rather it's sort of us fine tuning the words that we're going to use to carry

13:26.440 --> 13:28.600
on further conversation.

13:28.600 --> 13:33.360
It's almost like lexical grooming that we engage in.

13:33.360 --> 13:39.700
And part of all of this is when we get into these cases where we have to argue about the

13:39.700 --> 13:45.560
meaning of what's really racism and what's really sexism, what is a woman, for example,

13:45.560 --> 13:47.720
does it include trans women?

13:47.720 --> 13:52.960
All of these things are what I called in the book, lexical warfare.

13:52.960 --> 13:56.960
And the idea is, well, what happens, you know, often we're in this position where we are

13:56.960 --> 14:05.080
actually litigating what the meaning of a term is going to be.

14:05.080 --> 14:09.300
And so there's no easy answers to how to do that.

14:09.300 --> 14:14.640
But what I try to do is look for certain norms that govern the right way to do it and the

14:14.640 --> 14:16.320
wrong way to do it.

14:16.320 --> 14:21.600
And hopefully, hopefully we are going to get better or have a better understanding of how

14:21.600 --> 14:26.800
to litigate these word meanings, especially when the cost is extremely high, because basically

14:26.800 --> 14:33.080
every ethical issue we engage in is on some level, a kind of debate about what a word

14:33.080 --> 14:40.120
is supposed to mean, you know, what is a person, you know, what is what is terrorism, what

14:40.120 --> 14:46.800
is what is freedom, you know, all of these things, basically everything you when you

14:46.800 --> 14:51.360
look at it, what you're doing is you're arguing about what the meaning of the word should

14:51.360 --> 14:52.360
be.

14:52.360 --> 14:56.880
Now, that doesn't mean any definition is equally good, because there are rules that sort of

14:56.880 --> 15:03.080
dictate or norms that dictate whether we are adjusting the meanings of those words correctly.

15:03.080 --> 15:08.600
I mean, Bill Clinton himself said that it depends on what is the definition of the word

15:08.600 --> 15:09.600
is.

15:09.600 --> 15:17.200
Yeah, I think he was, I think he was asking what they meant by the tense of that.

15:17.200 --> 15:20.320
But yeah, yeah, I mean, it can sound kind of shady.

15:20.320 --> 15:23.680
I mean, well, that's the thing, once you, you know, once you understand that you're

15:23.680 --> 15:29.000
going to be negotiating the meanings of terms, then you have to then you have to be careful

15:29.000 --> 15:32.120
because people can pull some really shady stuff with you.

15:32.120 --> 15:33.120
And people do it all the time.

15:33.120 --> 15:36.640
I mean, the government is the government for well, I don't mean to pick on a government

15:36.640 --> 15:41.020
or the government, but they're always trying to shift the meaning of a term, you know.

15:41.020 --> 15:48.960
So now, Antifa people are terrorists, you know, you know, it's always it's always going

15:48.960 --> 15:49.960
on.

15:49.960 --> 15:52.640
It's like an ongoing battle and you have to stay on your toes.

15:52.640 --> 15:55.920
This fluidity of words and terms.

15:55.920 --> 15:58.080
This is not a modern phenomenon.

15:58.080 --> 16:01.080
This must have existed throughout history, right?

16:01.080 --> 16:02.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:02.640 --> 16:08.040
We are where we are in this warfare that you're talking about, maybe because this process

16:08.040 --> 16:13.540
of litigation has been democratized by the use of different kind of devices that now

16:13.540 --> 16:18.940
people have their own voices that can be heard, that it didn't really matter maybe 100 years

16:18.940 --> 16:24.380
ago that there were different definitions of racism, the definition that would turn

16:24.380 --> 16:30.900
into a status quo was determined and established by a centralized structure of authority that

16:30.900 --> 16:35.180
had control over newspapers or different kind of media and that was the term.

16:35.180 --> 16:40.120
But now with these, you know, I always refer to these that we're like monkeys with machine

16:40.120 --> 16:41.120
guns.

16:41.120 --> 16:47.440
We don't really know the power of these things, but we are using them for our own biologically

16:47.440 --> 16:49.480
driven intentions.

16:49.480 --> 16:56.520
Yeah, I mean, I think I mean, it's hard to know exactly what the consequence of new media

16:56.520 --> 16:58.080
is going to be for this.

16:58.080 --> 17:04.440
For sure with the advent of television and so forth in the previous century, you might

17:04.440 --> 17:10.100
have thought, oh, wow, this is really great because now we can discuss alternative meanings.

17:10.100 --> 17:13.800
But what you got instead was more of a system of control.

17:13.800 --> 17:21.040
That is one understanding or one meaning of the term became quasi-official.

17:21.040 --> 17:29.400
I mean, it's not like we had some academy that was telling us what a word should mean,

17:29.400 --> 17:35.920
but because of corporate control of media in the United States, there was a kind of

17:35.920 --> 17:40.160
control of what words could mean in accepted media.

17:40.160 --> 17:45.720
Now that raises the question, now that we're all monkeys with our little computers in our

17:45.720 --> 17:47.920
hands, what is that going to mean?

17:47.920 --> 17:53.840
Is it going to mean we get a kind of fractionalization of different word meanings?

17:53.840 --> 17:55.560
And that could happen.

17:55.560 --> 18:01.800
And what you could get is a bunch of people descending into different bubbles where, you

18:01.800 --> 18:05.400
know, this cluster understands a word like freedom in this way.

18:05.400 --> 18:09.040
This cluster understands a word like freedom in a very different way.

18:09.040 --> 18:12.320
And now we're just talking past each other.

18:12.320 --> 18:19.640
So the real trick, I mean, it's easy to have a unified meaning of what a term is.

18:19.640 --> 18:23.160
And it's easy to have little clusters of different meanings.

18:23.160 --> 18:31.560
The hard part is getting these clusters to find common ground with each other and negotiate

18:31.560 --> 18:33.880
what the words ought to mean, right?

18:33.880 --> 18:40.720
And that is the skill that I think perhaps we have lost somewhere along the way.

18:40.720 --> 18:46.560
I mean, I don't know, I mean, any sort of historical story is going to be somewhat fantastical

18:46.560 --> 18:47.560
here.

18:47.560 --> 18:52.520
But I can imagine an earlier history and an earlier time when people got together in the

18:52.520 --> 18:59.800
bazaar or whatever, and they're not just negotiating the price for spices or whatever, right?

18:59.800 --> 19:03.720
Let's say we're on the Silk Road or something and we're negotiating prices, but we're also

19:03.720 --> 19:05.960
negotiating word meanings.

19:05.960 --> 19:12.240
And I tend to think that there wasn't necessarily set understandings of what a word is supposed

19:12.240 --> 19:14.840
to mean, right?

19:14.840 --> 19:20.400
But maybe with the 20th century, we began to have those kinds of set understandings.

19:20.400 --> 19:29.600
And even now, when we ghettoize ourselves into different bubbles inside of Facebook,

19:29.600 --> 19:35.560
I'm not sure that we are addressing important questions about not just what words mean to

19:35.560 --> 19:37.640
us and our friends, but what they ought to mean.

19:37.640 --> 19:42.360
Yeah, it was also a matter of documentation of them too, right?

19:42.360 --> 19:47.640
The idea that history is written by the victor, that what we are reading is not necessarily

19:47.640 --> 19:51.760
what had happened, is what has been written down and documented.

19:51.760 --> 19:56.040
And the difference right now is that this process of documentation or litigation that

19:56.040 --> 19:57.680
you're saying, it's been democratized.

19:57.680 --> 20:03.840
So it's not that there is any kind of a singular kind of a foundation, because there are different

20:03.840 --> 20:08.200
kind of needs, different kind of desires, different kind of...

20:08.200 --> 20:09.200
People are different.

20:09.200 --> 20:14.600
Equality, objectively, has no meaning, naturally speaking, at least to me.

20:14.600 --> 20:18.120
Equity is a different kind of a story, but the fact that you want to start everything

20:18.120 --> 20:21.240
at point zero, what are we going to do?

20:21.240 --> 20:26.360
Are we going to eventually genetically engineer everybody to start at the same ground with

20:26.360 --> 20:27.480
the same kind of...

20:27.480 --> 20:28.480
It's just impossible.

20:28.480 --> 20:29.480
Right.

20:29.480 --> 20:30.480
Impossible.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.480
We all start from different places, right?

20:31.480 --> 20:37.440
And so given that we're starting from different places, how do we engage with each other and

20:37.440 --> 20:42.400
create, in my terminology, micro-languages with each other so that we can communicate

20:42.400 --> 20:46.000
even though we begin from different starting places?

20:46.000 --> 20:51.880
And you mentioned a point earlier where when we look back historically, we often don't

20:51.880 --> 20:59.600
really understand how variegated language was and all the different forms in which it could

20:59.600 --> 21:07.080
be found, ranging from how things were written to the different understandings of word meanings.

21:07.080 --> 21:13.120
And hopefully, if nothing else, what the internet is going to give us is a vast repository where

21:13.120 --> 21:14.120
we're...

21:14.120 --> 21:18.520
A hundred years from now or a thousand years from now, we're going to be able to study

21:18.520 --> 21:24.120
the different ways in which people were using language in our time.

21:24.120 --> 21:28.200
And this depository now is being used for development of artificial intelligence as

21:28.200 --> 21:29.200
well, right?

21:29.200 --> 21:33.600
And let's think about this context in the big picture of what Marshall McLuhan said,

21:33.600 --> 21:36.880
that man becomes sex organs of the machines.

21:36.880 --> 21:41.520
We're basically feeding the machines to become whatever that they're going to become.

21:41.520 --> 21:44.880
And it seems like more and more aspects of our lives are becoming digitized.

21:44.880 --> 21:47.480
So this is not a process they're going to reverse at any point.

21:47.480 --> 21:48.480
It's just going to accelerate.

21:48.480 --> 21:54.920
I mean, it's very interesting to think about what is the nature of the symbiotic relationship

21:54.920 --> 22:05.360
we have with the internet, because it is taking on a big chunk of our cognitive function.

22:05.360 --> 22:08.680
I mean, it's onloading lots of our memory.

22:08.680 --> 22:14.000
And so you might ask a question, I mean, there's certain philosophers, like a guy named David

22:14.000 --> 22:16.560
Chalmers has asked this question, where exactly is...

22:16.560 --> 22:17.560
Extension.

22:17.560 --> 22:18.560
Extended mind.

22:18.560 --> 22:19.560
Exactly.

22:19.560 --> 22:23.280
And so, well, where is my mind?

22:23.280 --> 22:25.080
Well, where's my memory?

22:25.080 --> 22:28.440
I mean, that's an easy, you know, because like you asked me a question, I don't remember

22:28.440 --> 22:29.440
the...

22:29.440 --> 22:33.400
Well, a great example is you asked me the title of my book and I can't remember the

22:33.400 --> 22:34.400
subtitle.

22:34.400 --> 22:35.400
Well, I can't remember it.

22:35.400 --> 22:38.480
I just don't have my phone handy and I don't want to be rude and pick it up.

22:38.480 --> 22:39.600
But that's it.

22:39.600 --> 22:46.120
I just like offload a bunch of my memory onto my telephone or into the internet.

22:46.120 --> 22:55.320
And so we begin to create this very weird symbiotic relationship with a machine, but

22:55.320 --> 22:59.160
not just with our physical bodies, right?

22:59.160 --> 23:02.200
But actually our minds are...

23:02.200 --> 23:05.440
Much of our mental processing is being done externally.

23:05.440 --> 23:10.200
You know, people always talk about, oh, I want to get a computer inserted in my head.

23:10.200 --> 23:11.760
It's too late for all that.

23:11.760 --> 23:12.960
In effect, that's already...

23:12.960 --> 23:15.040
You don't have to put it in your head, right?

23:15.040 --> 23:25.200
The fact that you're relying on the internet and on Google or DuckDuckGo or whatever search

23:25.200 --> 23:32.400
engine you use, the fact that you're relying on that to reason and to carry on your cognitive

23:32.400 --> 23:38.080
functions shows that that fusion of your mind with the internet is to some extent already

23:38.080 --> 23:45.800
happened and you don't need to do sci-fi things like implant things into your head.

23:45.800 --> 23:49.280
So you're not on board with Elon Musk's Neuralink?

23:49.280 --> 23:50.280
No.

23:50.280 --> 23:53.960
I mean, it would be interesting to see what happens.

23:53.960 --> 23:58.480
I would expect something interesting to happen.

23:58.480 --> 24:04.000
And from an engineering problem, it'll be really fascinating.

24:04.000 --> 24:09.400
But from a philosophical issue, it's almost like, well, yeah, but it's kind of...

24:09.400 --> 24:14.400
We've already done that in a way, in the most interesting way, at the most philosophical

24:14.400 --> 24:16.480
level, it's already happened.

24:16.480 --> 24:17.480
One of the arguments...

24:17.480 --> 24:21.300
I've talked to a number of people about this.

24:21.300 --> 24:26.480
One of the arguments is that in order to find who we are, which is the way to find about

24:26.480 --> 24:35.240
the universe and everything else to look within inwardly, we require to develop higher levels

24:35.240 --> 24:41.960
of cognition, cognition ability, because we're doing really good compared to monkeys, but

24:41.960 --> 24:43.720
we could do way better.

24:43.720 --> 24:48.120
Whatever the definition of that better is, that's debatable.

24:48.120 --> 24:51.520
But the fact that what we're experiencing is not all there is.

24:51.520 --> 24:57.080
We can experience far more, let's say like in matrix kind of an environment.

24:57.080 --> 25:04.720
And to get there, we cannot rely on biology and trial and error driven process of evolution.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.520
Now that's very arrogant.

25:06.520 --> 25:10.920
Some people would say, well, you're playing God and you don't know how this going to affect

25:10.920 --> 25:14.080
and influence your environment and you can mess everything up.

25:14.080 --> 25:21.020
But at the same time, it has a spiritual kind of aspect to it too, that if I can know more

25:21.020 --> 25:26.080
and be more, why wouldn't I do it?

25:26.080 --> 25:30.120
I've never been on board with this kind of project.

25:30.120 --> 25:35.360
Because I feel that you can change your cognitive makeup.

25:35.360 --> 25:39.560
People think, well, all right, there must be a higher plane of reality that I can achieve.

25:39.560 --> 25:41.600
I could know things better.

25:41.600 --> 25:46.920
But it's always occurred to me that you might achieve a different way of thinking, but I

25:46.920 --> 25:51.760
don't know that...

25:51.760 --> 25:55.440
There's an interesting sense in which it's a higher plane.

25:55.440 --> 25:58.920
It's a different plane, right?

25:58.920 --> 26:03.360
And you might get there and you might look down at your previous life before you enhanced

26:03.360 --> 26:08.360
your mind with implants and so forth and you say, wow, that was really stupid.

26:08.360 --> 26:16.080
But that's not really evidence that you've achieved a higher plane, right?

26:16.080 --> 26:21.060
It may be evidence that you've achieved a plane of higher hubris or something like that.

26:21.060 --> 26:28.400
And the other element to it is I'm not convinced that we are even close to bumping up against

26:28.400 --> 26:32.120
natural limits to our own intelligence.

26:32.120 --> 26:35.680
Part of that is because I don't think our own intelligence is solely a function of what's

26:35.680 --> 26:37.880
going on inside of our heads.

26:37.880 --> 26:43.320
And this brings us back to the business about the extended mind.

26:43.320 --> 26:48.640
That my mind is in part a function of what's going on in the external world already.

26:48.640 --> 26:53.040
And if all these amazing things are happening in the internet and artificial intelligence

26:53.040 --> 26:57.580
and big data, and all of those can be construed as part of my mind.

26:57.580 --> 27:00.960
But furthermore, there are these methods of communication in which I can communicate and

27:00.960 --> 27:04.600
exchange ideas with people like you, right?

27:04.600 --> 27:13.320
I am very rapidly achieving higher and higher, I don't know, planes of consciousness is the

27:13.320 --> 27:19.440
right word, but certainly I'm learning a lot more and thinking in ways that I couldn't

27:19.440 --> 27:22.600
imagine thinking earlier, right?

27:22.600 --> 27:29.720
So to me that there are these avenues of sort of naturally growing that are much more interesting

27:29.720 --> 27:38.600
to me than to try and find some sort of imaginary wall to our intelligence or some sort of ceiling

27:38.600 --> 27:40.880
to our intelligence is a better way to put it.

27:40.880 --> 27:43.720
Which if we could break through that, then we can see the world correctly.

27:43.720 --> 27:45.160
Yeah, I totally agree.

27:45.160 --> 27:51.960
And it's very interesting, I mean, I would consider myself a transhumanist in a sense

27:51.960 --> 27:57.100
that I believe that humanity and technology, we have evolved together in a sense the way

27:57.100 --> 28:02.440
that Kubrick portrayed it in 2001 Space Odyssey.

28:02.440 --> 28:07.680
We found a tool and then we used it in order to obtain things for ourselves and then protecting

28:07.680 --> 28:11.120
those things against a different tribe and then a different tribe looked at us and they

28:11.120 --> 28:15.720
improved that tool a little bit and now we have International Space Station and reusable

28:15.720 --> 28:17.320
rockets and all that.

28:17.320 --> 28:22.420
But you're absolutely, I think, spot on with saying that we haven't even tapped into the

28:22.420 --> 28:29.160
full potential of our own cognition and ability and we cannot really make the claim otherwise

28:29.160 --> 28:36.760
when we have a variety of psychedelics completely illegal and hey, you cannot do that, don't

28:36.760 --> 28:40.200
you dare doing that and this is an interesting time we're talking about it because it's

28:40.200 --> 28:43.480
the second revolution of psychedelics that are happening right now.

28:43.480 --> 28:48.720
If really we're in the second revolution of, well, you know, it's funny you say that

28:48.720 --> 28:53.760
because I'm living in Mexico now and so, I mean, there are a lot of people that are

28:53.760 --> 29:01.680
experimenting with psychedelics but they have been for, you know, a thousand years, like

29:01.680 --> 29:07.880
the huichol with the peyote and so forth or if you go down to Brazil, lots of tribes and

29:07.880 --> 29:17.480
I mean, I actually have thoughts about psychedelics and their history with people which is that

29:17.480 --> 29:24.520
to some extent the human mind evolved to not really function that well, it's on its own

29:24.520 --> 29:30.540
like in isolation but we evolved to be able to function with the help of the things we

29:30.540 --> 29:35.640
find around us and in some sense that might be magic mushrooms or whatever the case might

29:35.640 --> 29:36.640
be.

29:36.640 --> 29:39.040
You're talking about the stoned ape theory?

29:39.040 --> 29:40.040
What's that?

29:40.040 --> 29:41.040
I don't know that theory.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.040
What?

29:42.040 --> 29:43.040
The stoned ape?

29:43.040 --> 29:49.960
That like almost every animal on the planet has a way of managing its mental health with

29:49.960 --> 29:58.920
the help of some form of drug, you know, from reindeers with their little red cap mushrooms

29:58.920 --> 30:04.240
to really, is there an actual theory with the name about stoned apes?

30:04.240 --> 30:09.400
Yeah, Terrence McKenna, Terrence McKenna's theory, stoned ape theory is that we basically,

30:09.400 --> 30:12.780
our brain evolved faster than the rest of our body because we started experimenting

30:12.780 --> 30:17.080
with psychedelics.

30:17.080 --> 30:22.200
I would say that we co-evolved with these substances, okay?

30:22.200 --> 30:23.200
So I don't know.

30:23.200 --> 30:27.600
I mean if you went back to early, early history, I believe we actually co-evolved with some

30:27.600 --> 30:33.280
of these substances and we can find them around on planet Earth right now because early human

30:33.280 --> 30:35.720
ancestors found them useful.

30:35.720 --> 30:44.520
And so to function correctly, cognitively, we needed these plants.

30:44.520 --> 30:45.520
We don't need them now.

30:45.520 --> 30:49.600
You know, we have Big Pharma that can help us, I suppose.

30:49.600 --> 30:56.160
But you know, if you try and, here again we get into this issue of the externalization

30:56.160 --> 30:57.520
of the human mind, right?

30:57.520 --> 31:02.440
It's not just what's in here and it's not just what we can connect with the internet.

31:02.440 --> 31:08.600
But once you start passing laws that prohibit people from using these substances, like peyote

31:08.600 --> 31:16.720
or whatever it might be, in a certain sense you're passing laws that are walling off parts

31:16.720 --> 31:19.640
of people's very own minds, if that makes sense to you.

31:19.640 --> 31:20.640
Yeah, absolutely.

31:20.640 --> 31:25.520
Yeah, I'm saying this is the second, I mean it's well established that we're going through

31:25.520 --> 31:31.800
a second psychedelic revolution because of organizations like MAPS, which is a multi-discipline

31:31.800 --> 31:37.080
multi-disciplinary association with psychedelic studies that they're pushing to legalize MDMA

31:37.080 --> 31:41.920
for example, to deal with depression and PTSD for, because there are more, for example,

31:41.920 --> 31:47.400
veterans are dying inside the United States than they're dying in the battlefield.

31:47.400 --> 31:51.840
And a lot of them get hooked on like opioids and stuff, but then they do like two sessions

31:51.840 --> 31:56.280
of ayahuasca and you know, it does magic for example for them.

31:56.280 --> 31:57.280
Interesting.

31:57.280 --> 31:58.280
Yeah.

31:58.280 --> 31:59.280
Interesting.

31:59.280 --> 32:01.880
It's a moral kind of argument.

32:01.880 --> 32:08.120
Yeah, I mean I'm not any sort of expert on this and I'm not, I mean I have my own way

32:08.120 --> 32:14.040
of managing my mental life, which involves a lot of time and the internet and with computers

32:14.040 --> 32:19.600
and so forth and gaming, but it's very clear to me that there are people that really need

32:19.600 --> 32:25.680
these substances and access to them and it's critical, it's a critical part of their mental

32:25.680 --> 32:26.680
lives.

32:26.680 --> 32:27.680
Yeah.

32:27.680 --> 32:30.400
And it's, it's, it's alien to deny that to people.

32:30.400 --> 32:31.400
Absolutely.

32:31.400 --> 32:33.400
Like say, well, you can't use this part of your brain.

32:33.400 --> 32:34.400
Yeah.

32:34.400 --> 32:35.400
Or explore it.

32:35.400 --> 32:36.400
Yeah.

32:36.400 --> 32:37.400
Or explore it.

32:37.400 --> 32:38.400
Yeah.

32:38.400 --> 32:39.400
Yeah.

32:39.400 --> 32:40.400
Yeah.

32:40.400 --> 32:41.400
Yeah.

32:41.400 --> 32:42.400
And so, but coming back to your point, I mean, yeah.

32:42.400 --> 32:45.760
So these are, I don't think of them as even tools.

32:45.760 --> 32:51.840
I think they are these, these, these substances, these natural substances are parts, critical

32:51.840 --> 32:53.320
parts of our mental lives.

32:53.320 --> 33:00.400
And so obviously if you deny yourself those elements to your mental life, you're going

33:00.400 --> 33:06.920
to set up certain limits to what you can and cannot think.

33:06.920 --> 33:12.680
And you start, you start placing, you start placing limits on, on your mental life.

33:12.680 --> 33:17.480
And that's when people start asking for things like, you know, I want to, I want implants

33:17.480 --> 33:18.820
or something like that.

33:18.820 --> 33:19.820
You don't need implants.

33:19.820 --> 33:23.720
You just, you just need the things that are already there and that's going to open up

33:23.720 --> 33:26.200
business that are so vast.

33:26.200 --> 33:33.960
I mean, we can't even begin to, we can't even begin to quantify the vastness of the spaces

33:33.960 --> 33:36.320
that are already available to us.

33:36.320 --> 33:40.120
I think the bridge that connects what we were talking about to back to the digital world

33:40.120 --> 33:45.560
and cyberspace, and I want to talk about crypto-anarchy, it really comes down to individual liberty

33:45.560 --> 33:50.840
that you, you will be able to determine who you are and what you're going to do with that

33:50.840 --> 33:57.600
information or data or whatever that determines you, that you represent in a cyberspace, for

33:57.600 --> 33:58.600
example.

33:58.600 --> 34:05.120
And I want to ask you about what is happening to the concept of individuality in the digital

34:05.120 --> 34:12.400
realm or cyberspace or metaverse and whether or not crypto-anarchy from your perspective

34:12.400 --> 34:17.840
is the soul, and I would argue that it should be decentralized crypto-anarchy, right, because

34:17.840 --> 34:22.440
I know that anarchy philosophically means that it's decentralized, but it seems like

34:22.440 --> 34:26.160
for humans you have to emphasize on key terms.

34:26.160 --> 34:35.000
Decentralized crypto-anarchy is the only way and only avenue in order to protect this sense

34:35.000 --> 34:41.240
of individuality, however it's going to be defined based on our evolution.

34:41.240 --> 34:48.600
Let me say that I am a bit concerned about all the talk of individualism that we get

34:48.600 --> 34:54.240
in the crypto sphere because it's onboarded a lot of libertarian talk and I'm sure that

34:54.240 --> 35:01.300
many of your listeners are libertarians and I have issues with libertarianism and talk

35:01.300 --> 35:07.320
of individualism and I would much rather frame all of this in terms of limits on what we

35:07.320 --> 35:12.600
could think, right, using a plural pronoun there, like, you know, what we can do, what

35:12.600 --> 35:25.400
we could think, and I don't – I think it's more helpful to think about what crypto-anarchy

35:25.400 --> 35:34.800
opens up to us in terms of possibilities for collaboration that otherwise couldn't happen

35:34.800 --> 35:40.800
because it has to be – in certain cases, it has to be hidden from maybe from the state,

35:40.800 --> 35:43.480
but the state is not the only problem here.

35:43.480 --> 35:51.800
It might have to be hidden from society as a whole because of certain negative attitudes

35:51.800 --> 35:55.740
that society has to the ideas that you're exchanging, right?

35:55.740 --> 36:01.680
So for me, if crypto-anarchy doesn't really open up a space for me to be me and I can

36:01.680 --> 36:05.880
do whatever the hell I want and I can think whatever I want, but it's more like it's

36:05.880 --> 36:12.720
opening up a space for us to engage in collective activities that we otherwise not have been

36:12.720 --> 36:20.120
able to do and that's going to benefit me because it's not just me sitting here in

36:20.120 --> 36:25.060
a vacuum but when I'm engaging with other people who now have this freedom as well,

36:25.060 --> 36:33.800
the freedom to negotiate new meanings and terms freely together, right, then that opens

36:33.800 --> 36:37.040
up another canvas for us to explore, right?

36:37.040 --> 36:41.580
Another unlimited canvas or at least a very vast canvas that's going to open up to us

36:41.580 --> 36:43.600
and allow us to explore.

36:43.600 --> 36:48.360
So individualism, I'd rather use a term like freedom and that would include not just

36:48.360 --> 36:56.000
individual freedom but collective freedom or community freedom, family freedom, you

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
know.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.800
Freedom of association maybe would be a good term, umbrella term.

37:00.800 --> 37:04.160
Freedom of association?

37:04.160 --> 37:08.840
Not just freedom of association but I mean there's more to it than that because if we

37:08.840 --> 37:15.000
have, I mean freedom to associate is key, right, and I mean the internet allows us to

37:15.000 --> 37:24.000
associate from across distances and what Crypto Anarchy does is allows people to associate

37:24.000 --> 37:28.520
with us that might not otherwise be able to, right, because their government might not

37:28.520 --> 37:34.040
even think they should be online so they have to find other ways of getting online.

37:34.040 --> 37:40.000
I mean they might have to use Tor or something to not be spied on when they're online talking

37:40.000 --> 37:44.960
with us and then once and so that freedom as you say, freedom of association is going

37:44.960 --> 37:49.760
to be critical but then once we get there we also have other freedoms.

37:49.760 --> 37:55.760
We have these freedoms to exchange these ideas once we're associating and we have the freedom

37:55.760 --> 38:09.600
to not just associate but to work together and to keep modifying or I like the word modulate,

38:09.600 --> 38:13.360
to modulate word meanings with each other and that's key too.

38:13.360 --> 38:18.680
That is that language should not be a prison to us but now language is going to be something

38:18.680 --> 38:25.240
that we can, that's going to work for us instead of us working inside of a little cage that

38:25.240 --> 38:29.920
language has provided for us and getting together with other people is the first step to that,

38:29.920 --> 38:33.840
right, because if you're alone or you're with the same group of people all the time

38:33.840 --> 38:38.040
then you don't have those options.

38:38.040 --> 38:42.840
It's not going to be obvious how you should be expanding your language but once you have

38:42.840 --> 38:49.680
the opportunity to sort of interact with people in other places, people from other cultures,

38:49.680 --> 38:55.280
people with different ideas and different micro-languages, that's when things really

38:55.280 --> 38:57.740
start to happen.

38:57.740 --> 39:01.520
This relationship between language and us that you're saying that we're reverting in

39:01.520 --> 39:06.280
a way that language will work for us rather than we work for the pre-established, there

39:06.280 --> 39:12.120
are people who are benefiting from those pre-existed definitions of language.

39:12.120 --> 39:15.040
They are, yes they are, yes.

39:15.040 --> 39:19.800
Maybe government is one of the best examples of them, churches are another one, education

39:19.800 --> 39:20.800
system.

39:20.800 --> 39:25.480
People will make the case that patriarchy, people will say that you and I benefit because

39:25.480 --> 39:30.880
of the sort of the patriarchal nature of language and so there's a kind of sexism built into

39:30.880 --> 39:38.000
language itself and then there is this project which is what they would call, I think the

39:38.000 --> 39:43.960
fancy word that philosophers use is conceptual ameliorization but what they mean is we want

39:43.960 --> 39:50.280
to change the – people have imposed these word meanings on us and they're not helpful

39:50.280 --> 39:55.560
and what we have to do is sort of break these definitions or bend the definitions because

39:55.560 --> 39:58.340
we can't make any progress until we do that.

39:58.340 --> 40:02.400
So yeah, basically in any sphere it's not just government, it could be cultural, it

40:02.400 --> 40:06.160
could be religious, right?

40:06.160 --> 40:10.780
What is a religious person, what is a moral person?

40:10.780 --> 40:19.040
People use language to imprison other people and so a big part of freeing yourself and

40:19.040 --> 40:26.040
freeing your family and freeing your friends is to resist this.

40:26.040 --> 40:32.080
First of all, identify when people are using language to imprison you and secondly, finding

40:32.080 --> 40:39.560
the tools that allow you to resist it and to make the case for your view of how language

40:39.560 --> 40:41.560
actually should be shaped.

40:41.560 --> 40:45.840
So what's going to happen to those benefactors of this language prison in the coming years

40:45.840 --> 40:49.880
as information is becoming more and more democratized?

40:49.880 --> 40:53.760
Yeah, well, they're going to freak out, obviously.

40:53.760 --> 40:59.160
They're going to freak out and you could see this, I mean there's going to be a kind

40:59.160 --> 41:05.000
of linguistic conservatism, I don't mean that like Republican versus Democrat because they

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
can both be conservative.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Just hold on to what is.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Yeah, yeah.

41:10.000 --> 41:14.200
And they're going to be pounding on tables saying, look, I have a dictionary right here

41:14.200 --> 41:19.520
and it says like, this is what a woman is, it can't be a trans person.

41:19.520 --> 41:24.940
No, I'm not making a case that trans women are women, I'm just saying the minute people

41:24.940 --> 41:29.120
open up a dictionary and says that's how you resolve it, those are the people that

41:29.120 --> 41:32.880
are falling back on a conservative sort of definition.

41:32.880 --> 41:39.520
And people are going to be saying, oh, this new definition is degeneracy.

41:39.520 --> 41:40.760
You're destroying language.

41:40.760 --> 41:42.120
This is another one you're going to hear.

41:42.120 --> 41:43.880
You're destroying language.

41:43.880 --> 41:46.720
Everything is going to fall apart because you're destroying language and you're not

41:46.720 --> 41:48.560
destroying language.

41:48.560 --> 41:52.680
You're destroying language, you keep it in a prison and you don't let it evolve, right?

41:52.680 --> 41:56.680
I mean, you keep it in a prison, it's like putting a tiger in a cage and just locking

41:56.680 --> 42:00.800
it up there and thinking that you are somehow preserving it by doing that.

42:00.800 --> 42:01.800
Well, you're not.

42:01.800 --> 42:04.680
You have to turn it loose.

42:04.680 --> 42:10.240
Do you think this point of authority to determine the definition and meanings of language is

42:10.240 --> 42:16.000
shifting from human governance and authority to artificial intelligence?

42:16.000 --> 42:23.200
I had not thought about that.

42:23.200 --> 42:30.160
Only artificial intelligence can inform these sorts of decisions.

42:30.160 --> 42:37.440
What would happen if an AI started telling us that, you know, you're using the definition

42:37.440 --> 42:41.440
of woman wrong or you're using the definition of freedom wrong?

42:41.440 --> 42:43.040
I don't know.

42:43.040 --> 42:52.080
The thing is that the way I perceive all of this is playing out is that there's certain

42:52.080 --> 42:59.040
people are going to come up and try and establish authority to you or establish their linguistic

42:59.040 --> 43:01.680
authority, okay?

43:01.680 --> 43:06.520
And there's a question, well, does that linguistic authority work here?

43:06.520 --> 43:13.400
So, you know, we get stranded on Gilligan's Island and the professor comes to us and says,

43:13.400 --> 43:19.160
well, no, actually a tomato is not a vegetable, it's a fruit, right?

43:19.160 --> 43:23.360
Well, okay, maybe he has some knowledge about science there.

43:23.360 --> 43:32.080
The question is, is that kind of authority relevant to how we talk about fruits and vegetables?

43:32.080 --> 43:36.680
Likewise, if an artificial intelligence came to us and said, well, I have all these reasons

43:36.680 --> 43:44.800
for thinking that, you know, a woman can't be a trans woman or that, you know, freedom

43:44.800 --> 43:46.960
had some sort of definition of freedom for us.

43:46.960 --> 43:52.600
He says that you have to serve the machine, but to be truly free, you have to serve the

43:52.600 --> 43:53.600
machine.

43:53.600 --> 43:59.000
And we're like, well, you know, you're a very smart AI, but like, you know, we don't

43:59.000 --> 44:01.360
necessarily have to take that on, right?

44:01.360 --> 44:09.720
And so it's still, even if there are smarter people out there, you know, we don't merely

44:09.720 --> 44:14.120
have the freedom to do this or we should have the freedom to do it, we also have the responsibility

44:14.120 --> 44:20.760
to say, well, look, I don't really, I don't know if I should onboard your definition just

44:20.760 --> 44:25.720
because you're smarter than me because I have my own reasons for defining words as I do.

44:25.720 --> 44:32.560
So maybe, you know, I have my own reasons for saying a tomato is a vegetable.

44:32.560 --> 44:36.280
And I don't really care what the artificial intelligence thinks about that.

44:36.280 --> 44:42.320
So at the end, so I guess my point is at the end of the day, we are going to have to still

44:42.320 --> 44:47.920
be responsible for deciding which authorities we're going to accept.

44:47.920 --> 44:54.160
And you know, I wrote a paper on this, but I actually never got around to writing.

44:54.160 --> 45:00.920
I gave a talk on this and it's one of my favorite things to think about, but I'm just inherently

45:00.920 --> 45:05.720
lazy about writing it down for some reason, which is about the issue of when you defer

45:05.720 --> 45:07.360
to authority, right?

45:07.360 --> 45:09.440
So it's a paper about deference.

45:09.440 --> 45:13.480
And so when you should defer to someone and when you shouldn't, but deference, not in

45:13.480 --> 45:20.040
like, should I cut my hair or should I, you know, salute a flag or something, but deference

45:20.040 --> 45:23.800
to somebody about word meaning, about what a word ought to mean.

45:23.800 --> 45:26.240
And it's not an easy topic.

45:26.240 --> 45:31.640
And so part of the idea I had is that no matter what the authority is, you have to issue a

45:31.640 --> 45:34.960
series of challenges to that authority, always.

45:34.960 --> 45:40.560
It doesn't matter even if it's like some cool kid in school, right, that's using a term

45:40.560 --> 45:44.640
and you think you should defer to that person about the meaning of a cool, a meaning of

45:44.640 --> 45:45.640
a term.

45:45.640 --> 45:47.960
Like suppose the meaning of the term is cool, what's cool?

45:47.960 --> 45:52.000
So there's some guy who looks like Arthur Frans Larell Fonsi from Happy Days.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.960
And we start, we defer to him, why?

45:53.960 --> 45:55.320
Is it because of his haircut?

45:55.320 --> 45:57.240
Is it because of his leather jacket?

45:57.240 --> 46:03.760
Well, even a character like Richie in Happy Days at certain points has got to challenge

46:03.760 --> 46:04.960
Fonsi.

46:04.960 --> 46:09.060
And so the idea is, well, when do you challenge these linguistic authorities?

46:09.060 --> 46:11.280
How do you challenge those linguistic authorities?

46:11.280 --> 46:15.360
And this is something that fascinates me because I have no idea how it's supposed to work or

46:15.360 --> 46:17.280
even how about we go about it.

46:17.280 --> 46:20.760
But it's a skill we have to acquire because it's critical.

46:20.760 --> 46:24.000
Because we're being surrounded by all these linguistic authorities.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.200
They don't always have our best interests in mind.

46:26.200 --> 46:28.520
They don't even have their own best interests in mind.

46:28.520 --> 46:32.800
And we have to know when they're like, you know, they're jumping the shark or something

46:32.800 --> 46:36.200
and sort of using a word like cool and correctly.

46:36.200 --> 46:43.920
We have to be able to, we need to defer to individuals at certain times, like doctors

46:43.920 --> 46:48.440
on the meaning of certain medical terms, for example, but we also have to be in a position

46:48.440 --> 46:50.200
where we can challenge them.

46:50.200 --> 46:52.880
And that is an art.

46:52.880 --> 46:57.220
And if I had rules for doing that, I would tell you what they are, but I'm not even sure

46:57.220 --> 46:58.220
there are rules.

46:58.220 --> 46:59.760
I think it's just some practice.

46:59.760 --> 47:00.760
Yeah.

47:00.760 --> 47:01.760
Exactly.

47:01.760 --> 47:05.280
And with this information, we have more uncertainty we are dealing with.

47:05.280 --> 47:09.400
And I want to go back to what you were saying about New York, that it was a very chaotic

47:09.400 --> 47:13.600
kind of an era that people were doing whatever they wanted to do and cool stuff were happening.

47:13.600 --> 47:18.460
It seems like we're going through the same kind of a period right now in a different

47:18.460 --> 47:25.280
kind of a way that people have access to devices to express themselves and challenge each other.

47:25.280 --> 47:29.240
And we don't, as you said, we don't really know what the rules are, but maybe there are

47:29.240 --> 47:33.600
no rules and good stuff happen as a consequence along the way.

47:33.600 --> 47:40.320
And we just have to learn to notice and realize those moments of harmony, enjoy them and just

47:40.320 --> 47:41.320
move on.

47:41.320 --> 47:48.640
Yeah, I agree with that, except I would say it is never the case that there are no rules.

47:48.640 --> 47:52.720
Sometimes you think there are no rules, but that's when you have to be really careful

47:52.720 --> 47:56.160
because that means you're not seeing the rules, right?

47:56.160 --> 48:03.520
It's like the, you know, the fish in the bowl thinks there's nothing out there, thinks it's

48:03.520 --> 48:07.120
completely free because it's just swimming around wherever it wants to go.

48:07.120 --> 48:10.240
And then those moments when you think that you're completely free, that's when you need

48:10.240 --> 48:12.000
to be most on guard.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
Yeah.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
That's awesome.

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
Yeah, absolutely.

48:15.000 --> 48:19.920
What are your thoughts on simulation theory?

48:19.920 --> 48:22.600
I know I don't understand what these guys are talking about.

48:22.600 --> 48:29.240
And some of them are my best friends, honestly, because maybe they just are putting it in

48:29.240 --> 48:35.280
a way that I don't understand because I wouldn't call it simulation theory, meaning do we live

48:35.280 --> 48:36.280
in a simulation?

48:36.280 --> 48:37.280
Is that the question?

48:37.280 --> 48:38.280
Simulation hypothesis.

48:38.280 --> 48:39.280
I better say no theory.

48:39.280 --> 48:40.280
Yeah.

48:40.280 --> 48:41.280
Yeah.

48:41.280 --> 48:48.880
I mean, because the thing is simulations typically don't have the relevant properties of the

48:48.880 --> 48:50.400
thing they are simulating.

48:50.400 --> 48:54.960
So for example, I can simulate hurricanes using a computer, but it's not like if I open

48:54.960 --> 48:59.360
up the computer, there's going to be lots of wind and rain in there, right?

48:59.360 --> 49:06.240
Likewise, I might be able to simulate some anything using artificial intelligence, but

49:06.240 --> 49:13.160
it doesn't mean that anything like whatever consciousness would be happening in there.

49:13.160 --> 49:20.680
I think a better way to make the same point would be, well, what if we are synthesizing

49:20.680 --> 49:21.960
worlds?

49:21.960 --> 49:28.480
So you're not merely simulating them, but you're synthesizing them somehow using, maybe

49:28.480 --> 49:33.480
using computers, maybe you can synthesize a reality using computers or something like

49:33.480 --> 49:34.480
that.

49:34.480 --> 49:40.320
And at that point, my attitude is, well, it doesn't matter if it's synthetic or nonsynthetic

49:40.320 --> 49:47.160
and maybe it's just synthetic worlds all the way down, who knows?

49:47.160 --> 49:56.000
So I've never really been grabbed by that simulation theory stuff.

49:56.000 --> 50:01.840
It's interesting to me because you've written about consciousness as well, right?

50:01.840 --> 50:02.840
Very little.

50:02.840 --> 50:09.280
I mean, I've read a lot about consciousness and some of my very best friends write a lot

50:09.280 --> 50:10.840
about consciousness.

50:10.840 --> 50:15.800
And when they give these arguments about zombies and so forth, I worry because I think I must

50:15.800 --> 50:23.200
be a zombie because I don't know what the missing ingredient is supposed to be.

50:23.200 --> 50:28.420
And I've always been suspicious of talks about, you know, philosophers have these fancy words

50:28.420 --> 50:34.160
for that sort of ethereal extra secret ingredient X.

50:34.160 --> 50:40.200
Sometimes they call it qualia, sometimes they call it sense data, it's sort of like, well,

50:40.200 --> 50:50.200
when you see something green, there is this green mental patch that exists somehow in

50:50.200 --> 50:54.840
your mind in addition to the green thing itself.

50:54.840 --> 50:58.040
And I've always been a bit suspicious of that.

50:58.040 --> 51:02.000
You know, the philosopher Gilbert Ryle talked about this and he says, well, you know, people

51:02.000 --> 51:09.440
talk about seeing a mental image with the mind's eye, but, you know, people never talk

51:09.440 --> 51:17.240
about smelling mental images of smells with the mind's nose, for example.

51:17.240 --> 51:22.520
We imagine popcorn, right, the smell of popcorn or buttered popcorn or whatever, but we don't

51:22.520 --> 51:28.540
fall into this thing like, oh, there must be this thing that the mind's nose is smelling

51:28.540 --> 51:30.640
in my head or something like that.

51:30.640 --> 51:42.160
And I think, I can't get past the feeling that when we start talking about these sense

51:42.160 --> 51:51.160
data or qualia or conscious experience stuff, that we aren't inventing something that isn't

51:51.160 --> 51:52.160
there.

51:52.160 --> 51:56.200
I mean, I guess Dan Dennett has a view that's similar to this.

51:56.200 --> 51:58.800
So I mean, this might be exactly his view.

51:58.800 --> 52:05.400
So maybe I'm a Danettian about this.

52:05.400 --> 52:09.520
Another interesting way to look at it, I have a guest, I really like having him, Chris Nebar,

52:09.520 --> 52:13.400
who is a neuroscientist, but he's also a Taoist.

52:13.400 --> 52:19.400
And his whole thing is that we have a right side mind, left side mind, and all this need

52:19.400 --> 52:25.120
to categorize and make sense out of stuff is the product of the left side brain.

52:25.120 --> 52:30.640
And the right side is more of a curious childlike kind of a brain that it doesn't matter what

52:30.640 --> 52:31.640
it means.

52:31.640 --> 52:36.360
It doesn't matter in what category fits, it's just that you're experiencing it.

52:36.360 --> 52:42.000
So try to make sense out of something with half of our brain, it just means that we're

52:42.000 --> 52:47.920
just making sense of maybe half of the thing that exists based on our own categorization

52:47.920 --> 52:49.920
of it.

52:49.920 --> 52:53.200
Yeah, that's right.

52:53.200 --> 52:57.400
I think you need the interplay of the two things, right?

52:57.400 --> 53:06.640
That is, you know, I'm immediately thinking of talking about concepts without percepts

53:06.640 --> 53:09.640
are empty, percepts without concepts are blind.

53:09.640 --> 53:15.040
So it's sort of like, and so you need that kind of organizational element, or you don't

53:15.040 --> 53:17.040
have any experience at all.

53:17.040 --> 53:23.160
But then once you get things organized, right, conceptually, perceptually, and so forth,

53:23.160 --> 53:29.000
you have to you have to keep interrogating the conceptual apparatus you've built for

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
yourself.

53:30.000 --> 53:35.320
And you have to keep tearing it down and challenging it with I forget which side left or right

53:35.320 --> 53:36.400
is going to do that.

53:36.400 --> 53:40.400
But I guess that's the left, the right side of the brain is going to do that.

53:40.400 --> 53:42.360
But that doesn't matter.

53:42.360 --> 53:48.680
So you have, you know, so you need the two, this kind of interplay between the two.

53:48.680 --> 53:51.480
You can't let either side sort of get lazy on you.

53:51.480 --> 53:56.560
Yeah, now, when I talked to Chris, the whole thing is that the West has been dominant by

53:56.560 --> 54:01.320
the left side of the brain that, you know, we just make sense out of everything and be

54:01.320 --> 54:03.000
convinced that this is it.

54:03.000 --> 54:06.360
But obviously, we have huge amount of problems here.

54:06.360 --> 54:13.120
It seems like Western cultures and societies have figured the surface really well.

54:13.120 --> 54:16.800
But don't you dare look beneath that because we have no answer for it.

54:16.800 --> 54:21.960
And you're going to go rogue if you if you'd be curious a little too much about them.

54:21.960 --> 54:25.240
Yeah, no, people get very uncomfortable, right?

54:25.240 --> 54:29.840
Because people and myself included, I mean, I like, I mean, I like it that much.

54:29.840 --> 54:34.960
But I do take some security when things are neatly organized, I know.

54:34.960 --> 54:37.760
And the concepts we're throwing around, we know what we mean.

54:37.760 --> 54:39.360
And, you know, we know what freedom means.

54:39.360 --> 54:43.640
We know what a woman is, we know what this and that is.

54:43.640 --> 54:50.200
And when those concepts start breaking down, it's, it's an uncomfortable feeling.

54:50.200 --> 55:00.360
And it is true that in the West, we do get we do like to lock down concepts, right?

55:00.360 --> 55:01.720
You know, it's a very weird thing.

55:01.720 --> 55:03.800
I mean, this is I think this is related.

55:03.800 --> 55:06.320
But if it's not, you could say this is not related.

55:06.320 --> 55:13.520
But I was at one point, I was reading literature from Japanese business schools.

55:13.520 --> 55:16.120
I just just because I thought it was interesting.

55:16.120 --> 55:19.880
And there were the people that were working for 7-Eleven in Japan.

55:19.880 --> 55:27.200
And the question was, how do you categorize the things that you have in your store?

55:27.200 --> 55:28.520
What you're going to order?

55:28.520 --> 55:33.520
What I mean, you think about it, it would never occur to you that that is a puzzle or

55:33.520 --> 55:36.080
a problem that needs to be solved, right?

55:36.080 --> 55:41.400
But you know, if you think, say you're in 7-Eleven USA, you know, these are the things

55:41.400 --> 55:45.760
that we're going to keep in our store, you're going to be left behind pretty quickly.

55:45.760 --> 55:50.240
Because the fact that we like things need to be organized in this way today, there's

55:50.240 --> 55:54.580
no guarantee that you know, the next generation of people coming along or this crop of immigrants

55:54.580 --> 56:00.320
or whatever, or however people are changing, these people using Hiawaska are going to want

56:00.320 --> 56:03.960
to categorize things in the same way.

56:03.960 --> 56:13.240
So what the business, these business school guys were looking at 7-Eleven Japan and looking

56:13.240 --> 56:20.440
at ways in which they maintain fluid categorization of the concepts of the things they were keeping

56:20.440 --> 56:24.680
on inventory and the things they were selling and the things they were ordering.

56:24.680 --> 56:29.680
And a lot of that involved not just having, you know, it involved having multiple people

56:29.680 --> 56:33.680
with different categorizations and throwing those people together.

56:33.680 --> 56:36.880
And so that when you have people with very different ideas, like I mean, I guess this

56:36.880 --> 56:42.560
brings us back to the Lower East Side of New York in 1979, when you get people with different

56:42.560 --> 56:47.600
ideas and different ways of categorizing the world, something new and interesting is going

56:47.600 --> 56:48.960
to come out of that.

56:48.960 --> 56:52.360
Yeah, Japan is such an, have you been?

56:52.360 --> 56:59.240
Yeah, yeah, but not, I mean, not nearly enough to really be any sort of authority on it.

56:59.240 --> 57:06.240
Yeah, I've been once and like three years ago and all my childhood, you know, in Iran,

57:06.240 --> 57:10.480
I watched a lot of anime and Japan for me was like India for hippies.

57:10.480 --> 57:13.600
I always wanted to go and it did not disappoint.

57:13.600 --> 57:19.360
And I always use it as an example of how organically they are adapting to technology.

57:19.360 --> 57:22.920
Like you go to a temple that's been built like thousand years ago and there's a robot

57:22.920 --> 57:26.600
priest in the corner that you can go and talk to and everybody's like, yeah, that's how

57:26.600 --> 57:27.600
it is.

57:27.600 --> 57:35.080
Yeah, no, I mean, that's my experience too, is they have this way of blending technology

57:35.080 --> 57:41.240
with culture that I don't necessarily see in the United States.

57:41.240 --> 57:49.720
I see it in some places, but technology seems more alien to it in the United States for

57:49.720 --> 57:50.720
some reason.

57:50.720 --> 57:51.720
It's something different.

57:51.720 --> 57:53.920
It's something alien to broader culture.

57:53.920 --> 58:00.400
I mean, with exceptions like in California and techno pagans and things like that.

58:00.400 --> 58:01.720
Yeah, absolutely.

58:01.720 --> 58:06.280
How do you see this coming decade shaping our civilization?

58:06.280 --> 58:10.920
Because what we're going through right now this year, it seems like a dent to our civilization

58:10.920 --> 58:14.960
and the sense of certainty and big changes are coming.

58:14.960 --> 58:15.960
Seems like it.

58:15.960 --> 58:17.600
How do you see it?

58:17.600 --> 58:23.160
I see it that like every 50 years we get a revolutionary period.

58:23.160 --> 58:27.600
Now I hear your dog is like that.

58:27.600 --> 58:34.920
The last round was in the late 60s and before that around 1917 and then you go back I suppose

58:34.920 --> 58:39.320
1848.

58:39.320 --> 58:45.520
Basically twice a century we get into these revolutionary periods and then people onboard

58:45.520 --> 58:46.520
new ideas.

58:46.520 --> 58:47.520
You get these conflicts.

58:47.520 --> 58:49.600
I think they're healthy conflicts.

58:49.600 --> 58:53.000
Well, I mean, I need to be careful.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.240
I mean, they're not always healthy conflicts.

58:55.240 --> 58:59.520
Sometimes they lead to like massive scale genocides.

58:59.520 --> 59:00.720
I know exactly what you mean.

59:00.720 --> 59:01.920
I totally agree with you.

59:01.920 --> 59:02.920
Big picture-wise.

59:02.920 --> 59:03.920
Yeah.

59:03.920 --> 59:04.920
Yeah.

59:04.920 --> 59:05.920
Yeah.

59:05.920 --> 59:06.920
Yeah.

59:06.920 --> 59:07.920
Yeah.

59:07.920 --> 59:08.920
Yeah.

59:08.920 --> 59:09.920
Yeah.

59:09.920 --> 59:16.680
We're seeing a lot of changes and right now I'm spending a lot of time in the decentralized

59:16.680 --> 59:26.000
finance little subculture of the cryptocurrency business.

59:26.000 --> 59:33.240
These are the people that are basically building platforms that are going to eliminate banks.

59:33.240 --> 59:36.120
They're going to eliminate insurance companies.

59:36.120 --> 59:38.560
They are going to eliminate lending institutions.

59:38.560 --> 59:43.720
They are going to eliminate the money transfer.

59:43.720 --> 59:48.400
You want to mention the name of some of them is XRP one of them?

59:48.400 --> 59:49.400
No.

59:49.400 --> 59:50.400
XRP is-

59:50.400 --> 59:51.400
Not really decentralized.

59:51.400 --> 59:52.400
Yeah.

59:52.400 --> 01:00:01.280
It's the evil one because they sold their soul and they're providing a platform for

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:05.440
transferring information between big banks.

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:15.440
So let's start with everyone knows Bitcoin and then the second one people might know

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:19.360
is Ethereum and the coin is called ETH.

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:24.680
What is interesting about Ethereum is that- let me start with Bitcoin.

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:30.120
If you think of Bitcoin as being this ledger that we all share, it's all over the world.

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:34.080
We can see who has what or what account number has what.

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:37.320
So it's this giant shared ledger and if you think about it, what it does is it gives us

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:43.560
a way of keeping track of money, doing the function that a bank does with that and also

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:46.240
allows us to transfer money.

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:55.520
So it eliminates one institution of human trust, so that's the key thing.

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:56.520
Absolutely.

01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:02.600
Centralized trust, typically involving a big corporation or a big bank like Chase or JPMorgan

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:04.720
and Chase or whatever.

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:12.200
Now when Ethereum came along, this kid who was then 18 years old named Vitalik Buterin-

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:15.600
Who I met once in Toronto.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:16.600
You met him?

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:17.680
I met him once.

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:26.200
I used to co-organize Toronto transhumanist meetups and I came across this man, Corey

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:27.200
something.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:28.200
He passed away unfortunately.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:32.840
He was one of the early investors in Ethereum and they had this place called Decentral on

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:40.360
Spadina and King and I just stopped by to see the place and he invited us to organize

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:45.800
it there and Vitalik was there and this was like a year before Ethereum was released and

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:50.440
really quickly just said hi, shook his hand and that was it.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.440
Yeah.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:55.600
No, I mean you should listen to his podcast if you could get him on.

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:56.600
He's amazing.

01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:01.280
If you look at some of the podcasts he does, he's very kind of somewhat robotic in style

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:02.760
but everything he says is like-

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:04.960
I would love to have them.

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.560
Yeah, absolutely.

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:11.680
So I actually got in on there.

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:13.080
I had some Bitcoin.

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:17.080
I was Bitcoin mining at the time and then I read about this project and it said, well

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:23.400
like if you send us a Bitcoin, we'll give you 2000 ETH.

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:27.160
I said, all right, what the hell, because like a Bitcoin was not worth anything at the

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.160
time.

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:29.160
It was like $250.

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:37.760
I said, what the hell, I'll get sent $250, I get 2000 ETH.

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:43.840
Because the project sounded amazing because the idea is just as you can record this information

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:48.800
on a Bitcoin blockchain and it's there, the whole history of this ledger is there for

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:56.840
everyone to look at, set in stone, Vitalik pointed out that, well, I can encode any amount

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:57.840
of information.

01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:02.000
I'm going to build a blockchain where you could encode enough information so that you

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.040
could encode in any computer program.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.920
Tokenize everything basically.

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:11.800
Tokenize everything and not only that, but you could activate these things so we could

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:15.320
build a contract that would execute itself.

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:16.320
Smart contracts.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.320
You wouldn't need, right.

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.320
So there you go.

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:23.800
You don't need an organization of trust in order to hold the money for us or even make

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:26.240
sure that the contract is executed.

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:29.080
It just automatically gets executed.

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:37.160
And given that the language is, as we say, Turing complete, any contract that you can

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:42.040
write that's computable can be put into the blockchain.

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:50.040
And people for the, I guess, Ethereum just had its fifth birthday a couple of weeks ago

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:53.640
and it's taken some time for it to find its feet.

01:03:53.640 --> 01:04:02.480
But right now there is a segment of crypto called decentralized finance or DeFi in which

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:07.280
people are now taking these tools and they are really going to town with these tools

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:10.520
and really doing things like issuing loans.

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:14.360
People are now putting mortgages on the blockchain.

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:22.000
People are engaged in, well, obviously fancy things like futures and futures markets and

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.280
so forth.

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:26.740
Insurance.

01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:34.560
So the thinking is that eventually people are going to wake up to the idea that we don't

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:42.920
need to pay some middleman to sit in a big fancy bank in a giant building on Fifth Avenue

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:48.160
to do all this stuff and to hold our money and to invest that money in a carbon bubble

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:51.720
or the military industrial complex or anything like that.

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:57.520
You and I and all of our friends and people like us can just submit small amounts of money

01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:03.800
into these contracts and then we basically build our own hedge fund, for example.

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:06.980
And we have like computers that are doing arbitrage for us.

01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:10.080
We don't need big fancy companies to do that.

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:16.040
And so just as you don't see at Tower Records anymore, you don't have to go to Tower Records

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:26.600
to buy music, it's very rare to see giant bookstores these days, you buy all that stuff

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:39.440
on Amazon, Lord willing, these corporations, giant banks, giant insurance companies, they're

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:42.040
all going to go the way of Tower Records as well.

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:45.080
I totally agree.

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:48.000
I had just briefly, I had John McAfee on.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.560
I saw that interview, yeah, that was hilarious.

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:52.560
That was a trip.

01:05:52.560 --> 01:06:03.160
I was amazed that you were able to get into a word edgewise though because he'll keep

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:04.160
rolling.

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.160
Oh yeah.

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:12.480
And in the beginning, he was like, just so you know, I keep drinking throughout the interview.

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:19.640
So his thing, his thesis was that Bitcoin is going to go down and will do any other

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:23.760
cryptocurrency that does not have anonymity into it.

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:27.000
So I think he has a new coin.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.600
I'm not recommending it.

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:29.600
He said Monero.

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:34.280
Ghost also is something that I think he has developed himself or with a bunch of people

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:38.800
he's been backing, but Monero, because of anonymity part of it.

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.160
But I guess that goes back to libertarianism.

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:43.480
That's more important to him than it is to us.

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:45.920
But yeah, well, that'll be interesting.

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.440
That's entirely possible.

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:58.120
That's entirely possible, in which case, yeah, these coins that do a better job of mixing

01:06:58.120 --> 01:06:59.920
up the transactions.

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:07.680
So for example, right now, it's very easy to decipher our transactions using Bitcoin

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:09.180
because here's an account.

01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:14.320
It went from me to this account and people figure out it's mine, they figure out it's

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:18.280
yours, and pretty soon they can reconstruct a network.

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:23.120
But when you get to things like Monero, it's basically mixing the transactions up.

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:26.760
So you don't really know who it's coming from or who it's going to.

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:27.760
Excellent.

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.240
Well, Peter, this was awesome.

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:34.160
I was looking forward to this conversation and definitely didn't disappoint.

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:40.560
What is next for you and where can our audience follow your work?

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:42.760
You mentioned you were working on two projects.

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:45.800
Yeah, let's see.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:08:03.240
You know, I have some basic website that just keeps track of the basic stuff.

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:07.840
And I've just created a new Twitter account.

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:12.680
And again, my extended mine is kind of offline here right now.

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:15.080
So let's just have people start there.

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:20.400
I think, you know, they know how to use the internet, they can find me.

01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:21.400
Excellent.

01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:26.200
Let me ask you, I actually look for you on Twitter because the final product you've seen

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:30.760
my podcast, I put the Twitter handle on the bottom, I couldn't find yours.

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:34.560
I think I found a post from a couple of years ago, but your account was deleted.

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:37.320
So I'm going to add that to the notes after the show.

01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:41.800
Yeah, I think the Twitter account I'm using right now is brand new.

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:45.520
I have like 10 followers, so you guys can help me out with this.

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:46.520
Let me see.

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:47.520
I think it's...

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:49.880
Wait, I'm going to check right now.

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:57.360
But the name is EJ Spode, as in letter E, letter J, Spode, S-P-O-D-E.

01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:09.440
And I'm just checking here right now to see if there is some underscore involved in that.

01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:11.960
EJ underscores Spode.

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:22.960
Also, I have a couple of papers online under that pseudonym as well.

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:34.200
I have a book review of the Kingdom of Language by Tom Wolfe and a paper actually, it's on

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:41.640
Ethereum and this issue of trust and the limits of decentralized trust.

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:48.280
And a couple of other papers under that name, but I've just fired up this Twitter account,

01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:50.840
EJ underscores Spode.

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:55.000
Yeah, tell your listeners or watchers to add it so I have...

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:00.200
It's really embarrassing because I only have like 10 followers at this point.

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:05.080
Well, and Rome wasn't built overnight, so...

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:09.720
Let me ask you the final question I ask all my guests, that if you come across an intelligent

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:14.680
alien from a different civilization, what would you say is the worst thing humanity

01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:19.640
has done and what would you say is our greatest achievement?

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:28.520
See, I need to watch your podcast to the very end because then I would be prepared for this.

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:34.680
I'm glad you didn't because just getting caught off guard is one of the best moments of each

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:35.680
episode.

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:36.680
Yeah.

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:37.680
So, okay.

01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:40.360
So, it's the best and worst of humanity.

01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:44.520
That's what I have to explain to this alien.

01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:56.560
Well, I think that the worst thing is that we imagine ourselves as being somehow above

01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:04.160
the natural realm and that we are somehow alien to the natural realm or we're somehow

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:09.960
different from it.

01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:20.600
And maybe that's also the best thing because it means we're questioning who we are and

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:26.100
even if we're getting it wrong and even if we're thinking we're special in a way that

01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:29.920
we're not, I mean, at least we're asking the question.

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:35.560
So, the best thing is also the worst thing and let the alien ponder that and sort it

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:36.560
out.

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:57.360
Awesome.

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.620
you
