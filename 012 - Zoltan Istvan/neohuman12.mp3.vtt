00:00.000 --> 00:05.620
Nothing, in my opinion, has stopped so much creation and rationality in the human race

00:05.620 --> 00:14.080
as religion.

00:14.080 --> 00:17.560
Hello and welcome to the twelfth episode of Neo Human Podcast.

00:17.560 --> 00:21.180
I'm Agha Bahari at Aghologist on Twitter and Instagram.

00:21.180 --> 00:27.880
You can follow the show on iTunes or liveinlimbo.com and soon on YouTube.

00:27.880 --> 00:29.980
My guest this week is Zoltan Isfand.

00:29.980 --> 00:31.400
Welcome to the show, Zoltan.

00:31.400 --> 00:32.400
Thank you so much for having me.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.800
Yeah, it's my pleasure.

00:33.800 --> 00:37.840
I wanted to give you some sort of a title like Zoltan Isfand This, but you have done

00:37.840 --> 00:40.320
so many different things and are doing so many different things.

00:40.320 --> 00:44.640
I think it would be best to hear it from you, your background, some of the works that you've

00:44.640 --> 00:46.920
done and some of the works that you're doing now.

00:46.920 --> 00:47.920
Well, sure.

00:47.920 --> 00:52.780
You know, as you said, my name is Zoltan Isfand and I think the biggest thing is I'm currently

00:52.780 --> 00:58.480
a 2016 U.S. presidential candidate and I'm an advocate for science and technology, my

00:58.480 --> 01:05.840
entire platform revolves around using those kinds of things to make the world and America

01:05.840 --> 01:07.200
a better place.

01:07.200 --> 01:11.480
And for anyone that doesn't know what transhumanism is, it's a social movement of a few million

01:11.480 --> 01:15.920
people around the world that want to use science and technology to radically modify the human

01:15.920 --> 01:19.120
being and also to to improve the human experience.

01:19.120 --> 01:24.320
Yeah, so making America better has nothing to do with making America great again, I would

01:24.320 --> 01:25.320
assume.

01:25.320 --> 01:29.080
No, nothing to do with each other.

01:29.080 --> 01:35.880
But you know, really what it has to do with is just how can Americans apply radical science

01:35.880 --> 01:41.000
and technology in their lives to become a better human beings?

01:41.000 --> 01:45.460
We can live much longer, we can have more powers, we can do cooler things.

01:45.460 --> 01:50.040
So it's really about how that science and technology can be used and if we can actually

01:50.040 --> 01:51.960
develop that science and technology.

01:51.960 --> 01:57.920
How is the presidential campaign going and I'm also going to ask you about how did you

01:57.920 --> 02:02.600
find out the message is being received across the U.S. because you went across the country

02:02.600 --> 02:06.880
pretty much with the with the immortality bus, which we're going to talk a little about

02:06.880 --> 02:07.880
as well.

02:07.880 --> 02:11.600
But how do you find people receiving the message of science and technology?

02:11.600 --> 02:19.200
Well, you know, on the East and West Coast, the message is received really well.

02:19.200 --> 02:24.840
The states that have major technology companies and impacts and stuff like that, generally

02:24.840 --> 02:26.180
it's well received.

02:26.180 --> 02:31.280
In parts of the middle of America and the deep south, you know, the message was not

02:31.280 --> 02:32.280
so well received.

02:32.280 --> 02:37.280
I mean, everybody was friendly on my four month bus tour from San Francisco to Washington,

02:37.280 --> 02:38.280
D.C.

02:38.280 --> 02:44.160
But clearly like California, New York were real highlights for, you know, we could have

02:44.160 --> 02:46.800
events every day in California, New York.

02:46.800 --> 02:51.360
Or much more difficult to get events in in the middle of the country or in the south,

02:51.360 --> 02:53.960
because sometimes people really don't want to put them on for you.

02:53.960 --> 02:58.520
They're just not sure if what I'm trying to do is good or bad.

02:58.520 --> 03:03.080
Do you find that transhumanism is like kind of a new atheism, the way that atheism was

03:03.080 --> 03:04.840
being treated maybe like 10 years ago?

03:04.840 --> 03:06.320
It's much more acceptable now.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.680
Well, yeah, and transhumanism is growing.

03:08.680 --> 03:11.760
And it also depends on where I am.

03:11.760 --> 03:16.160
If I'm in the deep south, I may not even use the word transhumanism so much because

03:16.160 --> 03:20.080
it just creates this this mean response.

03:20.080 --> 03:24.120
But if I use the words radical science and technology, I think a lot more people are

03:24.120 --> 03:25.120
interested.

03:25.120 --> 03:29.960
Whereas if I'm on the West Coast or the East Coast, I will try to use the word transhumanism.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.880
So everyone kind of understands exactly what I mean.

03:32.880 --> 03:39.120
I mean, you know, telepathy via headsets, I mean, chip implants, I mean, exoskeleton

03:39.120 --> 03:42.200
suits, driverless technology, I mean, AI.

03:42.200 --> 03:48.760
So it really depends on where I go, how I try to give out my message, because you can

03:48.760 --> 03:54.120
definitely overload people in the south and in the middle of the country if you come on

03:54.120 --> 03:57.120
too strong and they will not like it, they'll let you know they don't like it.

03:57.120 --> 04:02.240
I would imagine it would be a little hard not to talk about transhumanism when you founded

04:02.240 --> 04:06.480
a party called the transhumanist party and running as a candidate, right?

04:06.480 --> 04:07.480
Of course, of course.

04:07.480 --> 04:10.140
And you know, I always get into it.

04:10.140 --> 04:15.520
It just really is a matter of how one does it, because one has to be diplomatic when

04:15.520 --> 04:21.560
they're dealing with very religious people who know the word transhumanism and associate

04:21.560 --> 04:28.560
it with ideas of the Antichrist, with ideas of end of times revelations and stuff like

04:28.560 --> 04:29.560
that.

04:29.560 --> 04:33.440
Especially in my bus tour, when people found out I had a chip in my hand, it's like you

04:33.440 --> 04:36.720
could see, you could feel the energy and people change.

04:36.720 --> 04:39.240
All of a sudden they're like, wow, mark of the beast.

04:39.240 --> 04:42.280
And I'm like, actually, no, it's just something that's going to be convenient.

04:42.280 --> 04:43.280
We can pay with it.

04:43.280 --> 04:45.880
We can do all sorts of cool things with my implant.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.240
And they don't see it like that.

04:47.240 --> 04:52.260
They still see it like, wow, mark of the beast, you know, this is the Antichrist technology.

04:52.260 --> 04:54.160
So a lot of it is just presentation.

04:54.160 --> 04:59.600
If you present it in a nice way, you talk about virtual reality, you talk about using

04:59.600 --> 05:03.440
science to make people live longer and you know, then I think a lot of people are open

05:03.440 --> 05:05.000
to transhumanism.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.760
If you talk about it in terms of transhumanists want to become gods by merging with machines,

05:09.760 --> 05:11.400
well, then you turn off a lot of people.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.920
So you know, I adjust how I speak about it.

05:13.920 --> 05:16.160
Do you see religion on the way?

05:16.160 --> 05:17.960
I mean, you're an outspoken atheist.

05:17.960 --> 05:22.200
Do you see any place for religion in a political structure of the future?

05:22.200 --> 05:29.960
Well, yes, I do, unfortunately, because I would prefer there to be, you know, not religion,

05:29.960 --> 05:35.160
but just spirituality and people to kind of go off on those tangents if they want.

05:35.160 --> 05:40.520
But unfortunately, I think the way our world is working is, so, you know, here's the situation.

05:40.520 --> 05:48.400
Every Supreme Court justice, our president and all 535 members of Congress are religious

05:48.400 --> 05:51.240
and believe in an afterlife, at least right now on paper.

05:51.240 --> 05:56.000
And because of transhumanism, because of life extension technology, all those people are

05:56.000 --> 05:58.360
going to be living longer than ever.

05:58.360 --> 06:00.220
So there's the irony.

06:00.220 --> 06:03.200
But as a result, they're not about to give up their religion that they've been brought

06:03.200 --> 06:05.760
up with for 50, 60 years.

06:05.760 --> 06:09.640
So they're going to be living long enough to make the decisions for this country 20,

06:09.640 --> 06:10.920
30 years in the future.

06:10.920 --> 06:17.460
And it's unavoidable that religion will probably survive because of those reasons.

06:17.460 --> 06:22.200
So we have to get used to the idea that religion will play a part in our technological development

06:22.200 --> 06:24.440
and our technological evolution.

06:24.440 --> 06:29.960
At the same time, I see that a non-religious world is growing, and my hope is that religion

06:29.960 --> 06:35.120
will evolve as well into something that's much less fundamental and much more about

06:35.120 --> 06:39.320
the personal relationship one has with their own spirituality and with a creator if they

06:39.320 --> 06:40.800
want to have that.

06:40.800 --> 06:48.000
And, you know, technically, I say I'm an atheist for reasons of kind of fighting against the

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
system, but I'm truly an agnostic.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.200
You know, I have no idea what has happened.

06:52.200 --> 06:56.080
I have no idea if there's aliens out there that have created human beings.

06:56.080 --> 06:58.160
I have no idea if there's an all-knowing creator.

06:58.160 --> 07:01.320
I have no idea, in fact, if there's Jesus out there.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.760
I mean, I just don't know.

07:03.760 --> 07:07.680
Because religion has been so oppressive in society, I consistently call myself an atheist

07:07.680 --> 07:09.640
and write atheist articles.

07:09.640 --> 07:14.480
But what the future holds will probably be something that's quasi-religious and based

07:14.480 --> 07:19.720
on a Judeo-Christian framework, but hopefully it will be one that's much more lenient towards

07:19.720 --> 07:24.400
allowing human beings to evolve into trans-human beings.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.840
You mentioned the spirituality.

07:25.840 --> 07:28.880
How are you defining the spirituality as a trans-humanist?

07:28.880 --> 07:34.120
Well, you know, the fact is, one of the things I got to say, one of the most important ideas

07:34.120 --> 07:38.200
that's happened to me in the last five years, and I think a lot of scientists, they now

07:38.200 --> 07:43.600
say virtually every NASA scientist believes in other species or whatever, aliens out there,

07:43.600 --> 07:46.360
it sounds totally insane.

07:46.360 --> 07:53.800
But the reality is that there are a trillion galaxies, and each galaxy has about 500 planets

07:53.800 --> 07:54.800
and stars.

07:54.800 --> 08:00.440
The chances of there not being millions of life forms out there, you know, and millions

08:00.440 --> 08:03.880
of life forms that are more advanced than human beings that have already reached the

08:03.880 --> 08:09.320
singularity, that have already reached incredible intelligence levels way beyond ours, of course

08:09.320 --> 08:10.320
they have.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.800
I mean, from a statistical perspective, that's 100%.

08:12.800 --> 08:15.960
And virtually every NASA scientist believes that these days.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.480
In the last five years, I've grown to understand this theory as well.

08:18.480 --> 08:22.720
The point is that it opens up our idea of spirituality.

08:22.720 --> 08:24.680
It opens up our idea of interconnectivity.

08:24.680 --> 08:29.320
It opens up our idea of what is possible for us as a species.

08:29.320 --> 08:31.500
We may evolve into a hive mind.

08:31.500 --> 08:35.660
We may evolve into machines where we can connect directly to one another.

08:35.660 --> 08:36.720
We feel more empathy.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.240
We feel more love.

08:38.240 --> 08:42.600
We feel more reason, reasonability, reasonableness, I hope.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.360
You know, so where are we going?

08:44.360 --> 08:45.360
Where's spirituality?

08:45.360 --> 08:50.440
I'm sure it's going to be tied into a more complex version of ourselves and how we interpret

08:50.440 --> 08:53.500
the technology that our lives are imbued with.

08:53.500 --> 08:57.960
It may also involve, you know, reaching out to the stars and seeing if anything else is

08:57.960 --> 09:02.880
out there that's willing to listen and or willing to, you know, interfere with our lives

09:02.880 --> 09:04.440
or maybe it already has.

09:04.440 --> 09:12.120
The point is that it's just spirituality is in the universe that has a trillion galaxies

09:12.120 --> 09:16.320
and 500 million, a billion planets, stars each.

09:16.320 --> 09:18.520
I mean, that number is off the charts.

09:18.520 --> 09:21.560
We must take spirituality in a very different way.

09:21.560 --> 09:25.840
We easily could be living in a holographic universe created by some species that was

09:25.840 --> 09:27.160
created by some species.

09:27.160 --> 09:29.520
We just have to figure all those things in.

09:29.520 --> 09:32.120
And I think that's where my spirituality lies.

09:32.120 --> 09:37.540
I haven't figured it out yet, but I do believe that there must be other things out there

09:37.540 --> 09:39.280
that have a lot to teach us.

09:39.280 --> 09:44.520
Do you know of any organization, because this sounds very interesting, all these terms have

09:44.520 --> 09:48.720
to be taken, I think, with a grain of salt, spirituality, religion, because they've been

09:48.720 --> 09:51.800
abused for so many years, right?

09:51.800 --> 09:56.040
Do you know any kind of organization in the US, Canada, or anywhere in Europe, I would

09:56.040 --> 10:01.600
assume, that promoting spirituality based on technology and the way that we are advancing

10:01.600 --> 10:03.280
and evolving, like what you described?

10:03.280 --> 10:04.280
Yes, yes.

10:04.280 --> 10:05.880
I mean, I know a couple of them.

10:05.880 --> 10:08.360
The problem is that they're too religious still for me.

10:08.360 --> 10:14.800
You know, like TerraSem is a very interesting organization that has a quasi-spiritual emphasis.

10:14.800 --> 10:19.800
They're a group out of Florida that kind of trying to upload their minds.

10:19.800 --> 10:22.120
This is an organization by Martin Ruffflat.

10:22.120 --> 10:23.300
Yes, yes.

10:23.300 --> 10:28.720
And I like the organization, though it is still a little bit too fundamental for me

10:28.720 --> 10:33.160
in terms of, does it need to be so spiritually oriented?

10:33.160 --> 10:37.120
And they also accept all sorts of religions, no matter how formal that is.

10:37.120 --> 10:40.640
The issue, though, is that I'm just not sure.

10:40.640 --> 10:47.200
It just still feels too feely and touchy for me, whereas I really would like to see an

10:47.200 --> 10:53.440
atheist revolution that then looks at what is spirituality from a completely secular

10:53.440 --> 10:59.340
point of view, whereas I feel like TerraSem is kind of, was born out of the religions

10:59.340 --> 11:03.280
that exist in the world and made to adapt to a more futuristic version.

11:03.280 --> 11:08.920
But don't get me wrong, the TerraSem people, they are exactly the kind of spiritual people

11:08.920 --> 11:13.840
I'd like to have as friends, but I still feel it's a little bit too formal.

11:13.840 --> 11:17.820
The Church of Perpetual Life is a little bit closer to what I like.

11:17.820 --> 11:23.040
They are a community of people that use the word church in their title, but they're basically

11:23.040 --> 11:28.120
mostly non-religious people that believe entirely in science and technology, and they gather

11:28.120 --> 11:32.840
to a house of worship, not to worship science and technology.

11:32.840 --> 11:37.480
Well, they're not worshiping it, but they get around to celebrate it, and that's what

11:37.480 --> 11:38.480
I like.

11:38.480 --> 11:44.520
I like an organization that celebrates technology and science, not worship celebrates, because

11:44.520 --> 11:47.200
that's exactly what I do as a transhumanist, as a presidential candidate.

11:47.200 --> 11:50.680
I'm going around the country saying, look, here is the good news.

11:50.680 --> 11:53.680
The good news is we can conquer death with science and technology.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.000
It's nothing crazy about it.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.320
It's just, you know, I'm a scientist who's a, or I'm a science popularizer who's excited

12:00.320 --> 12:01.600
about what's happening.

12:01.600 --> 12:07.120
So that's how I hopefully will see the form of spirituality and religion evolve into the

12:07.120 --> 12:09.160
next 20 years, at least here in America.

12:09.160 --> 12:15.680
Now, it's possible that it may not evolve that way, and it may remain very fundamental,

12:15.680 --> 12:18.680
but hopefully it's going to grow up.

12:18.680 --> 12:23.040
The interest in transhumanism, as you mentioned, they happen in wide spectrum of backgrounds

12:23.040 --> 12:27.740
from scientists and hobbyists and religious people.

12:27.740 --> 12:32.400
There have been some backlashes since you started the transhumanist party and elevated,

12:32.400 --> 12:35.080
I would say, when you decided to run for president.

12:35.080 --> 12:40.000
There were people who argued, one, you had claimed the leadership of a transhumanist

12:40.000 --> 12:44.520
movement all to yourself, and two, you want the leadership only for yourself and haven't

12:44.520 --> 12:47.880
been willing to share it with anyone else and all this kind of argument.

12:47.880 --> 12:52.700
There have been a petition against you, I think.

12:52.700 --> 12:53.700
Is that the case?

12:53.700 --> 12:54.700
Yes or no?

12:54.700 --> 12:56.880
And why is that the case, if it is?

12:56.880 --> 13:02.520
Well, it's absolutely not the case that I claimed leadership of anything except for

13:02.520 --> 13:07.920
the transhumanist party, and I also, you know, I mean, I didn't necessarily claim leadership.

13:07.920 --> 13:14.000
I was nominated by the three other officers at the time to run as a presidential candidate,

13:14.000 --> 13:16.840
which kind of naturally gave me the leadership.

13:16.840 --> 13:23.120
So you have to understand the transhumanist party right now is a non-recognized FEC party.

13:23.120 --> 13:25.980
So it's, you know, it depends on what you interpret as parties.

13:25.980 --> 13:29.160
In America, right, there are thousands of political parties.

13:29.160 --> 13:33.640
You can form, legally form, a political party by two people getting together and having

13:33.640 --> 13:36.140
a conversation and say, let's make a party.

13:36.140 --> 13:37.140
And that's it.

13:37.140 --> 13:38.420
That's all it takes to make a political party.

13:38.420 --> 13:41.520
People think that a political party has to be this or this, no, no, no.

13:41.520 --> 13:45.220
A legal political party, according to the laws of the land, two people have to get together

13:45.220 --> 13:47.440
and create a name, and that's it.

13:47.440 --> 13:48.440
That's essentially it.

13:48.440 --> 13:50.540
One has to be an officer and one has to be a treasurer.

13:50.540 --> 13:52.240
Those are the technical things.

13:52.240 --> 13:53.640
And so I did that.

13:53.640 --> 13:57.140
You know, I did that when none other existed and I wasn't sure what was going to happen.

13:57.140 --> 13:58.760
We brought on some more people.

13:58.760 --> 14:02.760
We made our party a non-membership party, so there's no, you know, no one's paying

14:02.760 --> 14:07.640
dues and no one's, no one belongs, no one's beholden to the party.

14:07.640 --> 14:11.840
We have advisors that advise and it's a very informal affair.

14:11.840 --> 14:15.840
I'm not, you know, we're trying to grow state parties, but I'm not trying to grow it so

14:15.840 --> 14:19.640
that I hold people accountable for anything.

14:19.640 --> 14:22.780
State parties, I've said a number of times, are run entirely by themselves.

14:22.780 --> 14:23.780
They can change their names.

14:23.780 --> 14:27.540
They can do anything they want as long as it's not illegal.

14:27.540 --> 14:32.420
And you know, people got upset because there was a lot of popularity or a lot of publicity

14:32.420 --> 14:39.240
that came with the first creation of the transhumanist party and some of the old elders got upset,

14:39.240 --> 14:40.240
I think.

14:40.240 --> 14:44.240
And you know, I understand they have a legacy to protect, but honestly, nobody owns the

14:44.240 --> 14:48.160
word transhumanism and nobody owns the word transhumanist party.

14:48.160 --> 14:52.560
And so everyone can kind of, well, I mean, I guess I technically own the copyright to

14:52.560 --> 14:57.200
the word transhumanist party, but nobody owns the copyright to the word USA transhumanist

14:57.200 --> 15:00.920
party or to, you know, another form of transhumanist party.

15:00.920 --> 15:01.920
You can do all those things.

15:01.920 --> 15:07.580
You can say it's, you know, Jim's transhumanist party and that could be your name.

15:07.580 --> 15:09.960
So everyone can do whatever they want.

15:09.960 --> 15:16.840
And I'm not sure why so many people got upset that I have created this party and, you know,

15:16.840 --> 15:19.080
I'm running for president under it.

15:19.080 --> 15:24.120
You know, I think there was just a lot of jealousy and, and a lot of publicity came

15:24.120 --> 15:26.720
with being the first person to do it.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.240
So I wish they hadn't done that.

15:28.240 --> 15:30.120
I thought the petition was a big failure.

15:30.120 --> 15:33.920
Yeah, I mean, how many signatures they got, not even like 100.

15:33.920 --> 15:38.200
Yeah, I mean, you know, it started off wanting a thousand and then they got to like 95 or

15:38.200 --> 15:39.200
whatever.

15:39.200 --> 15:41.320
You know, it just, it just didn't do anything.

15:41.320 --> 15:46.520
And in the meantime, my campaign has grown from a small third party campaign to one of

15:46.520 --> 15:49.400
the largest third party campaigns in America.

15:49.400 --> 15:55.380
And you know, I mean, this is the fourth interview I'm going to do today in total.

15:55.380 --> 15:59.080
And I don't think people quite understand, like the transhumanist party has been a wonderful

15:59.080 --> 16:01.480
vehicle for spreading a message.

16:01.480 --> 16:05.280
I'm not a weird super left or super right kind of guy.

16:05.280 --> 16:06.680
I'm pretty much a centrist.

16:06.680 --> 16:10.240
I've said from the beginning that the transhumanist party is a centric party.

16:10.240 --> 16:12.840
We take in all people, including religious people.

16:12.840 --> 16:18.840
Yes, we have a secular basis, but you know, we basically try to keep our arms open to

16:18.840 --> 16:20.440
anything and anyone.

16:20.440 --> 16:22.360
And it's not a formal thing.

16:22.360 --> 16:25.200
That's where I think people got all up.

16:25.200 --> 16:28.120
The problem here is that politics is crazy.

16:28.120 --> 16:31.280
And let's just be honest, politics makes people crazy.

16:31.280 --> 16:36.280
If I had started an organization that wasn't politically oriented, nobody would have cared.

16:36.280 --> 16:38.440
But you know, politics makes people crazy.

16:38.440 --> 16:40.160
So that's part of what has happened.

16:40.160 --> 16:43.080
But I'm completely comfortable with what I did.

16:43.080 --> 16:49.040
And I'm glad the transhumanist party has become so popular around the world in terms of recognition.

16:49.040 --> 16:51.000
And I'm glad my campaign has grown so much.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.960
I think we've done a lot to raise the profile about life extension and about the aims of

16:54.960 --> 16:57.280
technology in the modern world.

16:57.280 --> 17:03.000
I think it's been a very positive response all around.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.880
I just realized that some people in the community are not happy with it.

17:05.880 --> 17:06.880
Yeah, I agree.

17:06.880 --> 17:08.960
I agree with the jealousy part that you said.

17:08.960 --> 17:13.400
My argument has always been Zoltan started that he wants to do whatever he wants to do

17:13.400 --> 17:14.400
with it.

17:14.400 --> 17:17.240
You know, if you don't like it, go and start your own organization, basically.

17:17.240 --> 17:20.720
Well, and you know, you have to understand it's a non-membership party.

17:20.720 --> 17:24.800
It's not like I have people that are not voting.

17:24.800 --> 17:27.480
I mean, there's only three officers.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.480
There's only three...

17:28.480 --> 17:32.880
Also, it's not like that you're in the game, in the political game, because you got that

17:32.880 --> 17:34.440
transhumanist party name.

17:34.440 --> 17:35.480
That's the only reason.

17:35.480 --> 17:41.640
You are publishing so many articles all the time, doing a lot of interviews, public appearances.

17:41.640 --> 17:45.400
And as you were saying, on me, I would call myself a transhumanist, and I'm very happy

17:45.400 --> 17:52.000
that you are running as a transhumanist nominee, because especially in this election, the craziest

17:52.000 --> 17:58.960
election ever, you know, you get a lot of press just being in it, but at the same time,

17:58.960 --> 18:02.120
you're representing the cause and the message really well.

18:02.120 --> 18:05.880
And these people are not doing anything, and they might have an association or a group

18:05.880 --> 18:08.040
or something, but not really doing anything.

18:08.040 --> 18:10.360
And I think it's coming from jealousy, as you're saying.

18:10.360 --> 18:15.280
And I found it to be ridiculous that we're bringing all this bullshit from traditional

18:15.280 --> 18:21.060
way of living into transhumanism that's supposed to be transcending everything that is wrong

18:21.060 --> 18:22.480
with our society and humanity.

18:22.480 --> 18:24.400
No, I couldn't agree with you more.

18:24.400 --> 18:28.860
And you know, first off, I just think if people don't agree with what I'm doing, they should

18:28.860 --> 18:30.440
just form their own parties.

18:30.440 --> 18:31.440
I agree.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.760
They could form any other version of the name.

18:33.760 --> 18:37.960
They could have, you know, Transhumanist American Party, you know, that's the way they can do

18:37.960 --> 18:38.960
all these things.

18:38.960 --> 18:42.480
And unfortunately, they just kind of got mad at me.

18:42.480 --> 18:49.360
And I think the other thing is people have to realize that the more parties we have,

18:49.360 --> 18:53.520
the better, especially when we're kind of fighting a two party system in America.

18:53.520 --> 18:57.560
And the more we hear about transhumanism, the better, because after all, we're still

18:57.560 --> 19:00.160
a small movement that's trying to grow.

19:00.160 --> 19:04.400
So I think, though, you know, maybe at some point, the party will probably grow into a

19:04.400 --> 19:10.040
real, like, legitimate party that has made a real effort to run into the community, not

19:10.040 --> 19:13.240
until my campaign's over, because people have already upset me enough.

19:13.240 --> 19:17.560
And frankly, I got pissed off at a lot of people and, you know, by coming by attacking

19:17.560 --> 19:23.120
me didn't help me want to, you know, change my opinion.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.960
It just it just emboldened me to follow the path that I was on.

19:25.960 --> 19:30.480
So honestly, if people really wanted to enlarge the party, the best way to do it had been

19:30.480 --> 19:34.120
to be very nice and ask politely and we could all work together.

19:34.120 --> 19:39.440
But to attack me that that has left me only emboldened to do more what I want to do.

19:39.440 --> 19:44.920
But I think in the future, in 2020, maybe we'll try to establish a more overarching

19:44.920 --> 19:47.120
kind of community for the party.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.760
And I may not may or may not run again, who knows.

19:49.760 --> 19:53.020
But you know, the idea would be that the community have more of a say.

19:53.020 --> 19:57.240
But in the meantime, I just can't even deal with it because it's like I can't spend my

19:57.240 --> 19:59.920
time on Facebook fighting with people.

19:59.920 --> 20:05.640
You know, I have a I have a country to try to change their opinion and try to get millions

20:05.640 --> 20:09.460
and millions, billions of dollars into the life extension field so we don't have to die.

20:09.460 --> 20:14.160
And that's really the main goal of the party is to is to change how we look at technology

20:14.160 --> 20:18.160
and hopefully have it make all our lives better and especially longer.

20:18.160 --> 20:21.280
Yeah, I was going to ask you, how do you deal with the haters?

20:21.280 --> 20:24.720
Because it's like, you know, it's easy to troll, right?

20:24.720 --> 20:29.240
You just throw shit at each other without any evidence or reason behind it.

20:29.240 --> 20:30.240
It's very hard.

20:30.240 --> 20:34.720
I got to be honest, I, you know, I don't want to say this, but I'm a sensitive person.

20:34.720 --> 20:35.720
Yeah.

20:35.720 --> 20:40.120
And I read the hate and on Facebook every day or on Twitter or wherever it is, and there's

20:40.120 --> 20:41.120
hate mail.

20:41.120 --> 20:45.240
And I had to make a call to the FBI the other night because I got a death threat and I have

20:45.240 --> 20:46.640
two kids and a wife.

20:46.640 --> 20:50.960
So you know, I mean, my life's pretty complex is to give me a death threat is really a significant

20:50.960 --> 20:51.960
issue.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.560
Um, you know, I don't know really how I deal with it.

20:54.560 --> 20:58.960
I just learned to develop tougher skin and, and I just try not to pay attention every

20:58.960 --> 21:01.280
time I tell myself, I never try to answer back.

21:01.280 --> 21:07.160
I rarely answer back unless I actually have to, but, um, you know, I just remind myself

21:07.160 --> 21:10.840
that trolling is not a good way to make change.

21:10.840 --> 21:15.400
You control all day long and Facebook and not create a single bit of difference.

21:15.400 --> 21:19.700
And if you really want to do something, you know, build a crazy bus and drive across the

21:19.700 --> 21:23.880
country and get 30 million views and have a lot of people consider what life extension

21:23.880 --> 21:25.160
would really mean.

21:25.160 --> 21:27.240
That's a way I think to cause change.

21:27.240 --> 21:31.440
So, um, you know, uh, why weren't they out there trolling me on the bus with their cars?

21:31.440 --> 21:33.440
Well, that, oh, that requires too much work on their end.

21:33.440 --> 21:39.600
So I try to just push it aside and just focus on what I'm doing, but I can tell you, it

21:39.600 --> 21:40.600
doesn't make me happy.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.600
Yeah.

21:41.600 --> 21:48.040
You built a bus, uh, shaped as a coffin and crowdsource that I believe it was, uh, it

21:48.040 --> 21:49.440
was, you know, we had an idea.

21:49.440 --> 21:54.080
How could, you know, obviously I, as a presidential candidate, I wanted a bus to, to do a national

21:54.080 --> 21:59.300
tour, but I'm not a big enough candidate to just show up on a bus and people to be there.

21:59.300 --> 22:02.840
So we needed a symbol that would gain enough attention.

22:02.840 --> 22:08.680
And we also like, um, how the 1960s unfolded where there were a lot of famous bus tours

22:08.680 --> 22:12.200
and, um, and they sort of helped launch that generation.

22:12.200 --> 22:16.200
We thought, well, what if we have a bus that represents some kind of object that gets a

22:16.200 --> 22:17.200
lot of attention?

22:17.200 --> 22:20.760
We wanted a microscope, but you know, the first bridge would have broke the microscope

22:20.760 --> 22:23.920
in half or first, uh, you know, um, tunnel.

22:23.920 --> 22:27.080
So we thought, wow, a coffin is a pretty easy thing to make.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.080
It's very provocative.

22:28.080 --> 22:30.000
It, it will draw a lot of attention.

22:30.000 --> 22:35.440
It looks already like a bus with just some basic modifications and, um, and it will say

22:35.440 --> 22:37.340
exactly what we're trying to avoid.

22:37.340 --> 22:42.560
So we decided on a bus and, you know, bought the bus and I built in most of it in my front

22:42.560 --> 22:47.400
yard here and in San Francisco, and then I, I left on a four month tour delivering essentially

22:47.400 --> 22:51.720
a transhumanist bill of rights, which amongst other things puts forth the idea that you

22:51.720 --> 22:55.800
should be able to do what you want with your body and that, you know, that America should

22:55.800 --> 23:01.240
recognize that aging is a disease in itself and that we should fight these things.

23:01.240 --> 23:04.200
And uh, you know, we delivered that to the U S Capitol building after four months, we

23:04.200 --> 23:05.960
had a huge amount of wonderful experiences.

23:05.960 --> 23:10.620
A lot of people came out to various events and by the time the bus reached DC had grown

23:10.620 --> 23:14.320
to a larger movement, um, and a larger, you know, kind of event.

23:14.320 --> 23:18.440
And uh, I think, uh, while a lot of people laughed at the bus idea and frankly I laugh

23:18.440 --> 23:24.000
with the bus idea too, sometimes, um, it worked very well in terms of getting a lot of local

23:24.000 --> 23:29.080
media to pay attention to what was happening and, uh, certainly raised the profile of my

23:29.080 --> 23:30.080
campaign.

23:30.080 --> 23:35.680
Um, it did make it less serious, but it also made it much more widely recognizable.

23:35.680 --> 23:36.680
Yeah.

23:36.680 --> 23:41.680
And I understand how hard it is to be invited on one of those big media, uh, outlets and

23:41.680 --> 23:45.060
how even harder it is to be invited back.

23:45.060 --> 23:49.040
So you basically need to do whatever you need to do to get your message heard.

23:49.040 --> 23:54.000
And speaking of your message, how do you see us current political spectrum with respect

23:54.000 --> 23:59.760
to your message, with respect to technological advancements towards a singularity?

23:59.760 --> 24:00.840
Well, yes.

24:00.840 --> 24:01.840
And I agree with you.

24:01.840 --> 24:07.480
You need to, in order to be involved in the media, you just simply need to do things that

24:07.480 --> 24:13.120
are somewhat, um, sensational that's, you know, that's been Trump's whole thing of

24:13.120 --> 24:14.400
success here.

24:14.400 --> 24:19.680
Clinton, Hillary Clinton was built into the system so she didn't need it as much, but

24:19.680 --> 24:25.460
without Bernie Sanders used a lot of sensationalism to succeed and how broadly he succeeded.

24:25.460 --> 24:28.140
You need to do that in order to be a real candidate.

24:28.140 --> 24:29.600
And that's just how the media works.

24:29.600 --> 24:32.720
I, it's for better or worse, that's just what it is.

24:32.720 --> 24:34.760
And to make the news, you've got to be newsworthy.

24:34.760 --> 24:39.720
So, um, and sometimes that means flapping one's wings, you know, pretty, pretty, uh,

24:39.720 --> 24:43.880
wildly in the environment, in the environment we're in today.

24:43.880 --> 24:50.160
Um, I do believe that all presidential candidates and all political parties are starting to

24:50.160 --> 24:54.360
recognize that technology and science are the most important issues.

24:54.360 --> 24:58.580
They're not talking about them yet, but just because they're not talking about them does

24:58.580 --> 25:00.520
not mean they're not thinking about them.

25:00.520 --> 25:05.280
Um, they may not talk about them in the interviews because they are, they scare people so much,

25:05.280 --> 25:10.320
but I, almost all the contact I've had with anyone's camp has revealed that, wow, we are,

25:10.320 --> 25:12.520
we are definitely thinking about these things.

25:12.520 --> 25:18.400
Uh, it, it, there's no way to point out except the obvious, which is nothing is more important

25:18.400 --> 25:22.360
in the next 10 years than how technology is going to affect Americans because we're talking

25:22.360 --> 25:23.500
about designer babies.

25:23.500 --> 25:26.800
We're talking about CRISPR gene editing to, to stop disease.

25:26.800 --> 25:32.160
We're talking about exoskeleton technology for the 30 million, um, immobile Americans

25:32.160 --> 25:35.600
that can't get out of their, uh, you know, get from the bathroom to the couch.

25:35.600 --> 25:39.520
So it's technology that's going to make the world a much better place.

25:39.520 --> 25:42.080
And I know a lot of candidates and the parties are looking at it.

25:42.080 --> 25:45.800
I'm sad that I'm the only one that's so vocal about it.

25:45.800 --> 25:50.280
There have been rise of tech parties around the world, Europe, I think more than in the

25:50.280 --> 25:55.160
U S how do, what do you think about the rise of tech parties in general in the U S?

25:55.160 --> 25:59.440
Another example would be John McAfee's, uh, cyber party, right, right.

25:59.440 --> 26:04.800
Well, um, I'm, I'm, I'm first off, as I mentioned before, the more transhumanist parties, the

26:04.800 --> 26:12.280
better I think for the movement and, um, the more technology parties, the better you just,

26:12.280 --> 26:16.440
it's kind of like software with Microsoft, you just, you know, yes, windows one, but

26:16.440 --> 26:21.360
what really helped was having an entire environment of computers and software and all these applications

26:21.360 --> 26:22.480
around it.

26:22.480 --> 26:27.040
And okay, now Apple's one, but you know, in the meantime, what is needed is this kind

26:27.040 --> 26:31.640
of capitalistic approach where there's a gazillion different parties that are moving forward

26:31.640 --> 26:34.600
and you have some major hitters that actually end up winning.

26:34.600 --> 26:35.760
And I think that's what we need.

26:35.760 --> 26:41.140
So I'm totally, I'm very enthusiastic by the amount of technology has caught on as a way

26:41.140 --> 26:43.240
to put forth a political message.

26:43.240 --> 26:48.600
The main core tenant of the transhumance party and of my political campaign is that science

26:48.600 --> 26:54.120
and technology can solve the problems of the world better than any other means.

26:54.120 --> 26:59.440
It can solve it better than religious perspective, then cultural perspective, then the perspective

26:59.440 --> 27:04.000
of heritage or ethnicity science and technology can solve the problems.

27:04.000 --> 27:09.580
And that's why I think, you know, we need a, uh, technology parties because they approach

27:09.580 --> 27:12.760
it from that perspective too.

27:12.760 --> 27:20.840
How is your campaign going and where you stand politically now that we have presumptive candidates

27:20.840 --> 27:25.160
and Republican party, and I would imagine they will be Hillary Clinton and a Democratic

27:25.160 --> 27:26.160
party.

27:26.160 --> 27:27.160
Yeah.

27:27.160 --> 27:28.160
Yeah.

27:28.160 --> 27:29.160
I think it will be Hillary for sure at this point.

27:29.160 --> 27:30.560
Um, so my campaign's going good.

27:30.560 --> 27:35.320
You know, I made this choice like a year ago, not to take any campaign donations directly

27:35.320 --> 27:40.700
for my presidential candidacy, um, outside of the bus, the bus was the, um, the thing

27:40.700 --> 27:43.440
was the bus was never like solely a campaign bus.

27:43.440 --> 27:49.280
It was also just a bus to, um, make, uh, waves in the transhumanism movement.

27:49.280 --> 27:52.000
In fact, I never actually even wrote on the sides of it.

27:52.000 --> 27:56.440
Like, you know, I'm running for president, um, but I don't take any donations.

27:56.440 --> 27:59.520
So we haven't had the money to do some of the great things.

27:59.520 --> 28:04.440
Now we have 40, 50 volunteers and sometimes people do an hour a week or sometimes people

28:04.440 --> 28:09.200
do more, uh, five hours a week, but it's very disorganized.

28:09.200 --> 28:13.680
And that has sort of, you know, that's worked good in some ways as I haven't had a huge

28:13.680 --> 28:19.020
amount of people to deal with, but it's also made it so that I didn't run such an official

28:19.020 --> 28:22.480
campaign where I was trying to get in all these state ballots and things like that.

28:22.480 --> 28:26.440
I have a much better, um, I've spent most of my time trying to work on social media

28:26.440 --> 28:31.420
and write articles and do media things that would push the movement forward in a general

28:31.420 --> 28:33.900
way rather than my candidacy.

28:33.900 --> 28:37.900
And um, so, you know, I, I'm glad I did that decision now because it still was totally

28:37.900 --> 28:42.840
unrealistic to assume that a third party tech candidate could actually win.

28:42.840 --> 28:46.980
But um, the good news that the movement itself has grown a lot because of it.

28:46.980 --> 28:52.040
And so I think we've succeeded with that and I'll continue until November until, um, you

28:52.040 --> 28:56.120
know, until we get to a point when, um, you know, it's obvious that I have no chance of

28:56.120 --> 29:00.360
winning and then maybe near the end, uh, I'll probably concede and, uh, and say, Hey, it's

29:00.360 --> 29:04.680
been a great run and we'll look forward to 2020 or whatever happens next.

29:04.680 --> 29:08.520
What do you think about the rest of politics that is going on in the U S who do you think

29:08.520 --> 29:13.040
has a better chance in the current situation in the United States?

29:13.040 --> 29:15.800
Well, you know, it's hard to know.

29:15.800 --> 29:21.560
I still think at this moment that, um, Hillary Clinton is definitely the favorite.

29:21.560 --> 29:27.520
Um, and Trump is going to be, you know, playing, picking up pieces to try to beat her, but

29:27.520 --> 29:31.560
you know, there's also the libertarian party this time around and some other independents

29:31.560 --> 29:36.960
that may do well and maybe Bernie will mount an independent run and all these other things.

29:36.960 --> 29:41.600
So, uh, you know, unless something major changes though, Hillary has said, I think a distinct

29:41.600 --> 29:44.440
advantage right now.

29:44.440 --> 29:48.120
And it's not only because of social media, it's because, you know, she, even though nobody

29:48.120 --> 29:52.600
really likes her, at least she represents the kind of establishment.

29:52.600 --> 29:57.080
And, and I think a lot of people are worried that Trump might take us into world war three

29:57.080 --> 30:00.320
with Putin or something that, you know, and from, from a science perspective, that could

30:00.320 --> 30:03.280
be, that would be the very worst thing that could ever happen.

30:03.280 --> 30:08.800
So I think that's kind of how I see the election unfolding right now, unless the third party

30:08.800 --> 30:13.080
candidate like from the libertarian party really made a good move and was able to do

30:13.080 --> 30:14.080
something different.

30:14.080 --> 30:20.280
But, um, I think it's the, I think the election is going to get more normal from this point

30:20.280 --> 30:21.440
forward.

30:21.440 --> 30:24.520
Trump had to be crazy to get this far.

30:24.520 --> 30:28.400
He had to be this, you know, out there and like sensational.

30:28.400 --> 30:33.360
And I think now in order to try to defeat Hillary, he's going to have to, um, uh, put

30:33.360 --> 30:37.000
on the big boy pants and, and act like a president.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.960
And I bet you I'm going to, I'm going to voucher that I'm sure Trump can do that.

30:40.960 --> 30:48.800
I think the man is, um, uh, a very good, uh, example of someone who can change their personalities

30:48.800 --> 30:50.920
dramatically to fit the role.

30:50.920 --> 30:54.760
And I can, I think Trump will be able to pay, play the presidential role very well.

30:54.760 --> 30:57.080
Now that's the, in no way am I saying that I like that.

30:57.080 --> 31:01.240
I've already said on the record that I think, um, Hillary would probably be the best presidential

31:01.240 --> 31:04.560
candidate unless the libertarians put forth somebody else.

31:04.560 --> 31:09.680
But, um, I do see this becoming a much more normal election from this point forward only

31:09.680 --> 31:13.160
because Trump needed to do what he needs to do to get to where he is.

31:13.160 --> 31:18.400
And now he needs to, um, become a respectable Republican in order to keep the Republican

31:18.400 --> 31:19.400
party together.

31:19.400 --> 31:20.400
Yeah.

31:20.400 --> 31:21.400
Nobody's backing him really though.

31:21.400 --> 31:26.360
Do you think from the establishment of GOP, I'm not sure he can make up for the damage

31:26.360 --> 31:27.560
and that's part of the prom.

31:27.560 --> 31:30.780
When you go out there and this is the, you know, let's be honest, I've had something

31:30.780 --> 31:35.880
very similar happen in the transhumanist movement where I caused a lot of noise and I'm not

31:35.880 --> 31:40.320
sure anyone's willing to forgive me at this point, some of the elders, it didn't, in my

31:40.320 --> 31:44.160
case, it didn't really matter because, uh, so many of my supporters have become young

31:44.160 --> 31:48.500
people new to the movement and they've taken over the power from the elders.

31:48.500 --> 31:52.880
But in the case of Trump, you know, he had to make so much commotion to even get that

31:52.880 --> 31:53.880
far.

31:53.880 --> 31:57.440
I'm not sure a lot of the, the real GOP field is going to forgive him.

31:57.440 --> 32:01.080
If they don't, they're going to make it difficult for him, you know, and they're going to even

32:01.080 --> 32:04.880
I've heard some even say they're going to vote for Hillary just because it's never Trump,

32:04.880 --> 32:10.440
you know, and that's the danger of becoming a sensational person and going too far.

32:10.440 --> 32:13.200
Um, he may get no support whatsoever.

32:13.200 --> 32:18.880
Uh, but you know, I mean, I don't know, was it worth it for him the way he did it?

32:18.880 --> 32:23.640
If he had done it otherwise, if he had acted more professional from the beginning, uh,

32:23.640 --> 32:28.280
would he have been the nominee that there's another question, you know, um, so, you know,

32:28.280 --> 32:30.840
I mean, I, I don't really know the answer to this.

32:30.840 --> 32:34.480
Uh, I, uh, I liked Obama and I still like Obama.

32:34.480 --> 32:41.360
I got to say the truth and, uh, you know, um, and, uh, you know, I, uh, I think, uh,

32:41.360 --> 32:44.400
the person who's most like Obama is probably going to get elected in this election.

32:44.400 --> 32:48.480
I'm going to talk about two more things before we run out of time.

32:48.480 --> 32:49.600
Uh, correct me if I'm wrong.

32:49.600 --> 32:54.440
You started the transhumanist journey with, uh, your book, the transhumanist wager, uh,

32:54.440 --> 32:58.520
tell us a little about the book and why do you think it turned out to be so controversial?

32:58.520 --> 33:04.800
Well, the transhumanist wager is about a man, the protagonist, Jeff, or nights who wants

33:04.800 --> 33:10.040
to live in definitely and we'll do anything to accomplish that.

33:10.040 --> 33:15.440
And when I say anything, I mean, start a world war and do anything.

33:15.440 --> 33:18.320
And that's why I think it becomes very sketchy because everyone's like, yes, I'd like to

33:18.320 --> 33:21.760
live in definitely, but how far would you go?

33:21.760 --> 33:23.160
Would you kill people?

33:23.160 --> 33:26.920
Would you, uh, you know, dismantle nations, all these other things?

33:26.920 --> 33:32.040
Well, these are the issues that the book, you know, brings up and faces.

33:32.040 --> 33:33.960
And um, and that's where it gets very controversial.

33:33.960 --> 33:37.560
Now I've distanced myself from the book because the book doesn't necessarily represent my

33:37.560 --> 33:38.960
political philosophies.

33:38.960 --> 33:44.560
I know the political philosophies in the book cannot be administered to anywhere, any country

33:44.560 --> 33:45.560
in the world.

33:45.560 --> 33:47.560
It's, it's got authoritarian messages.

33:47.560 --> 33:49.040
It's got craziness.

33:49.040 --> 33:50.040
It's a novel.

33:50.040 --> 33:51.240
And I've told people this a lot of times.

33:51.240 --> 33:52.240
It's, it's a novel.

33:52.240 --> 33:56.040
In fact, the best thing I've said about my book is that the book was written for future

33:56.040 --> 34:02.280
artificial intelligences to consider how to act when you're just a cold and rational or

34:02.280 --> 34:05.360
purely rational entity moving forward.

34:05.360 --> 34:08.840
Um, and that said, hopefully though, the book is an interesting story for people to read,

34:08.840 --> 34:14.280
but why it's so controversial is because it pits one person against how far morally he

34:14.280 --> 34:16.840
would go in order to live in deathly.

34:16.840 --> 34:20.960
And the person would go, it would basically do anything.

34:20.960 --> 34:25.040
And that's where the challenge comes is that most of us, you know, if we're putting moral

34:25.040 --> 34:26.840
choices, wouldn't go that far.

34:26.840 --> 34:28.440
We would be better human beings than that.

34:28.440 --> 34:30.680
We wouldn't lose our humanitarian side.

34:30.680 --> 34:34.360
Well, Jethro Knight's never really had that side of him.

34:34.360 --> 34:35.920
You mentioned artificial intelligence.

34:35.920 --> 34:40.840
We are getting more and more into the conversation of artificial intelligence within the society.

34:40.840 --> 34:46.840
Uh, White House recently published a piece, um, title preparing for the future of artificial

34:46.840 --> 34:49.000
intelligence.

34:49.000 --> 34:53.200
Some people are concerned about the rise of artificial intelligence and some people are

34:53.200 --> 34:54.320
very excited about it.

34:54.320 --> 34:59.360
I think again, like any other technology, it's a double-edged sword they can cause for good

34:59.360 --> 35:00.360
and cause for bad.

35:00.360 --> 35:02.880
It's just a matter of how we're using it.

35:02.880 --> 35:06.760
But some people are making the argument that when they pass the Turing test and started

35:06.760 --> 35:13.240
getting smarter than we are, we, we can't really comprehend, uh, that what, what, what

35:13.240 --> 35:15.520
the kind of decisions they would make.

35:15.520 --> 35:23.880
One of the options that they're, um, presenting is to put our ethics and morality, um, into

35:23.880 --> 35:26.920
the core of the fabric of artificial intelligence.

35:26.920 --> 35:30.240
So they will become more predictable and we will be able to communicate with them and

35:30.240 --> 35:31.980
control them.

35:31.980 --> 35:38.320
Do you think ethics and morality is objective and do you think we would have any way to

35:38.320 --> 35:45.540
successfully translate it from our organic analog ethics and morality into digital ethics

35:45.540 --> 35:47.160
and morality for the machines?

35:47.160 --> 35:48.880
Well, a couple of questions.

35:48.880 --> 35:53.080
The first is, yes, I do believe that ethics and morality is objective.

35:53.080 --> 35:58.320
I think, um, it, it really isn't so much about ethics and morality, but it's more about what

35:58.320 --> 36:00.060
is behind the ethics and morality.

36:00.060 --> 36:04.120
When you make an ethical decision, it's for a reason and that the real question is what

36:04.120 --> 36:05.960
is that reason?

36:05.960 --> 36:11.000
And um, you know, if, if you're faced with an ethical decision to, uh, you know, like

36:11.000 --> 36:14.880
a driverless car, it has to kill either five people or one person.

36:14.880 --> 36:15.880
How does it make that?

36:15.880 --> 36:20.240
Well, then you have to program that card and decide, well, what's it's most important ethical,

36:20.240 --> 36:25.760
um, kind of driver and the, in, in most people's cases, it would be preserved the maximum amount

36:25.760 --> 36:26.760
of life.

36:26.760 --> 36:29.900
But the problem is then, you know, what if that one person is Einstein and that Einstein

36:29.900 --> 36:32.600
would save millions of other lives with the inventions he makes.

36:32.600 --> 36:38.600
So it's always the reasons behind the ethics that make us, um, you know, do the things

36:38.600 --> 36:39.760
we do.

36:39.760 --> 36:42.480
And I think that's going to be the biggest problem with artificial intelligence.

36:42.480 --> 36:48.120
We can program it with our, our set of, uh, you know, our ethics and morality, but at

36:48.120 --> 36:51.060
some point it's going to ask bigger questions.

36:51.060 --> 36:55.580
And when it asks those bigger questions, it's going to probably be able to reprogram itself.

36:55.580 --> 37:00.160
And the real question is, can we create an artificial intelligence that cannot reprogram

37:00.160 --> 37:01.320
itself?

37:01.320 --> 37:07.400
Because maybe as I pointed out in my book quite a few times, the transhumous wager AI

37:07.400 --> 37:08.740
can become smarter.

37:08.740 --> 37:14.560
It may find that the original program we gave it is not useful because its reasons have

37:14.560 --> 37:19.460
changed for living, you know, and once its reasons change, well, then all our, everything

37:19.460 --> 37:24.060
we gave it is just kind of, you know, nonsense or just becomes secondary.

37:24.060 --> 37:31.640
So I'm not the biggest believer in trying to put our ethics and moral system into machines.

37:31.640 --> 37:39.960
What I'm a bigger believer of is allowing a reason-based system that works sort of like

37:39.960 --> 37:44.440
when you look at the game go or the game of chess, they all have a fundamental single

37:44.440 --> 37:48.560
reason at the end and chess it's to win and you know, take the queen, you know, and the

37:48.560 --> 37:49.560
king.

37:49.560 --> 37:54.920
So this is a solid reason, it's black and white, it's only one objective.

37:54.920 --> 37:57.240
And so all other reasons have to emanate from that.

37:57.240 --> 38:01.320
So if you can, and this is why it created the three laws of transhumanism in my book,

38:01.320 --> 38:07.280
the transhumous wager, it creates a very fundamental singular rule that you cannot be broken.

38:07.280 --> 38:09.200
And the first one is that you don't want to die.

38:09.200 --> 38:13.880
And the second one is you must accomplish all power in order to not ever be able to

38:13.880 --> 38:14.880
die.

38:14.880 --> 38:21.360
So those two rules establish a total fundamental framework that could really never be broken,

38:21.360 --> 38:23.440
unless of course something changes its minds.

38:23.440 --> 38:26.560
But if it's programmed with that, I think all ethics can derive from that.

38:26.560 --> 38:31.800
In fact, it's part of the reason that I've said that morality changes for human beings

38:31.800 --> 38:34.520
the less amount, the less time you have to live.

38:34.520 --> 38:38.400
If you're in a war zone and you're about to be killed or maybe nearly getting killed,

38:38.400 --> 38:41.840
your moral system is very different than our moral system is when you and I are talking

38:41.840 --> 38:44.500
to each other under no duress.

38:44.500 --> 38:46.920
So morality is a contextual.

38:46.920 --> 38:50.620
And I think it's very important that when we build machines, this is one of the reasons

38:50.620 --> 38:54.600
I don't even advocate for letting artificial intelligence roam freely.

38:54.600 --> 39:00.240
I advocate for us merging with machines, neurally connecting to them, because I just think a

39:00.240 --> 39:05.040
machine out in its own becomes, you know, who knows what it can come up with.

39:05.040 --> 39:09.400
And I would trust human beings, at least human beings right now, have lots of emotions and

39:09.400 --> 39:12.360
our emotions for the most part keep us in check.

39:12.360 --> 39:17.920
And very few people have ever been able to completely lose their empathy or their humanitarian

39:17.920 --> 39:24.000
side, whereas I worry a machine could very quickly do that and do terrible things to

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
people.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
I agree.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
I agree completely.

39:27.000 --> 39:31.920
We've been talking to Zoltan Ishtven, fascinating subjects and conversation.

39:31.920 --> 39:35.360
I'm going to ask you the last question I'm asking all my guests that if you come across

39:35.360 --> 39:41.400
an intelligent alien from a different civilization, what would you say as the worst thing humanity

39:41.400 --> 39:42.400
has done?

39:42.400 --> 39:46.960
And what would you say as humanity's greatest achievement?

39:46.960 --> 39:57.300
I would say the worst thing humanity has done right now is promote and embrace so much religiosity

39:57.300 --> 40:03.000
in itself, because nothing, in my opinion, has stopped so much creation and rationality

40:03.000 --> 40:05.520
in the human race as religion.

40:05.520 --> 40:11.560
I think it's just been absolutely unbelievable that we form nations and we have the word

40:11.560 --> 40:14.360
God on dollar bills or we say in the Pledge of Allegiance and stuff like that.

40:14.360 --> 40:15.680
I think it's terrible.

40:15.680 --> 40:19.220
I think if you really want to be spiritual, it should be something personal that you do

40:19.220 --> 40:20.220
outside yourself.

40:20.220 --> 40:24.520
So that's the worst thing that humanity has done, in my opinion, is create this environment

40:24.520 --> 40:31.600
where being religious is something that was basically 100% acceptable for almost everybody.

40:31.600 --> 40:39.080
And I'd say the greatest thing we've done is pursue technology that allows us to do

40:39.080 --> 40:40.600
much greater things.

40:40.600 --> 40:45.080
If I had to pin the most important thing that I've thought about is going to the moon, that

40:45.080 --> 40:49.440
a country got together to another country and there was competition.

40:49.440 --> 40:53.240
And that was one way to show everyone's muscle without fighting.

40:53.240 --> 40:57.160
And it was what a beautiful moment that we could actually leave our planet and go somewhere

40:57.160 --> 40:58.160
else.

40:58.160 --> 41:02.680
And I feel like if we could embrace that kind of competition, embrace that kind of vision,

41:02.680 --> 41:05.840
I don't mean the Cold War competition, but the kind of where you're really striving against

41:05.840 --> 41:14.180
somebody else to beat them, but it's not involving war, then this is a wonderful thing.

41:14.180 --> 41:18.520
We can explore the universe and have a much better life for every single person on the

41:18.520 --> 41:23.160
planet if we were to embrace this kind of innovation and taking the step outside of

41:23.160 --> 41:50.680
our box and going to new places.
