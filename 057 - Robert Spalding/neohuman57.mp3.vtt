WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.320
I call it building, not breaking.

00:02.320 --> 00:06.920
The chief export of the United States has been breaking things using war in the last

00:06.920 --> 00:07.920
two decades.

00:07.920 --> 00:11.840
I think in the next two decades, we can say we've been builders and not breakers.

00:11.840 --> 00:16.720
I think we're going to be successful in kind of countering the rise of totalitarianism

00:16.720 --> 00:19.840
in our world.

00:19.840 --> 00:29.760
Hello, and welcome to the 57th episode of Neohuman Podcast.

00:29.760 --> 00:34.760
I'm a Gavahari etiologist on Twitter and Instagram, and you can follow the show on

00:34.760 --> 00:39.320
LiveInLimbo.com, iTunes, YouTube, and BitChute.

00:39.320 --> 00:44.320
And today with me, I have retired burgadier general Dr. Robert Spalding.

00:44.320 --> 00:47.960
Welcome to Neohuman Podcast, Dr. Spalding.

00:47.960 --> 00:48.960
Thank you.

00:48.960 --> 00:49.960
Great to be here.

00:49.960 --> 00:50.960
Yeah, it's a pleasure to have you.

00:50.960 --> 00:55.000
How about we start from the beginning, the work you've done, the lives you've lived,

00:55.000 --> 00:57.320
and what are you mainly focused on now these days?

00:57.320 --> 01:04.360
Yeah, so I just retired from the Air Force after almost 27 years being a B-2 pilot and

01:04.360 --> 01:07.480
spending a lot of time focused on China.

01:07.480 --> 01:13.960
I'm a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute where I'm at today, but also working on educating

01:13.960 --> 01:23.800
and advocating for understanding the challenges of closed systems being integrated with globalized

01:23.800 --> 01:25.840
Internet-connected world.

01:25.840 --> 01:29.480
Perhaps the best example for the closed system that you're focused on is the Chinese system.

01:29.480 --> 01:30.480
Right.

01:30.480 --> 01:37.400
Clearly, the Chinese Communist Party is the most predominant in that system, but there's

01:37.400 --> 01:38.480
others.

01:38.480 --> 01:40.960
How would you describe the Chinese Communist system?

01:40.960 --> 01:42.480
Because for a lot of people, it's unclear.

01:42.480 --> 01:46.800
Xi Jinping is called the president, but we don't remember an election, and then he was

01:46.800 --> 01:50.840
elevated to become a lifelong president.

01:50.840 --> 01:52.880
And I don't even think that they're calling him a president.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.240
Is he a chairman for life?

01:55.240 --> 01:57.440
How do you describe the system of their governance?

01:57.440 --> 02:02.600
Yeah, well, I mean, it can be very confusing because they have a party and then they have

02:02.600 --> 02:04.200
a government.

02:04.200 --> 02:07.520
And in China, there's two constitutions.

02:07.520 --> 02:12.200
There's the PRC, People's Republic of China constitution, and there's the Chinese Communist

02:12.200 --> 02:13.880
Party constitution.

02:13.880 --> 02:20.720
So it's actually confusing for governments as well because you interface diplomatically

02:20.720 --> 02:26.540
with the government, but yet the sovereign, the one that makes the decisions for the country

02:26.540 --> 02:28.080
is the party.

02:28.080 --> 02:32.520
And so if you think about our State Department, for example, it represents the sovereign for

02:32.520 --> 02:38.080
the country, and yet it interfaces with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which essentially

02:38.080 --> 02:42.640
is part of the People's Republic of China structure.

02:42.640 --> 02:47.920
But if you look at where the decisions are made, it's within the Chinese Communist Party.

02:47.920 --> 02:51.480
So diplomatically, we don't even interface with the sovereign.

02:51.480 --> 02:59.080
Now Xi is most widely known as president of China, but his real power comes from being

02:59.080 --> 03:02.360
the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party.

03:02.360 --> 03:06.440
This is the real authority within China.

03:06.440 --> 03:08.600
He's known as a president even within China.

03:08.600 --> 03:13.200
It's pretty clear his position that is, I don't want to say a dictator, but that's how

03:13.200 --> 03:15.700
he's being referred to by a lot of people in the West.

03:15.700 --> 03:18.280
So how do Chinese people look at him as?

03:18.280 --> 03:26.400
Well, I think it depends on one of the affectionate terms that the Chinese Communist Party pushes

03:26.400 --> 03:29.860
as Xi Dada, which is Papa Xi.

03:29.860 --> 03:35.520
But he is the general secretary of the party, and that's where the power really resides.

03:35.520 --> 03:38.480
And the same thing for provinces within China.

03:38.480 --> 03:44.460
You'll have a provincial governor, but the real power in the province will be the head

03:44.460 --> 03:47.800
of the Chinese Communist Party in that province.

03:47.800 --> 03:50.240
And really, that is the way the system is run.

03:50.240 --> 03:52.680
The party controls everything.

03:52.680 --> 03:57.320
This system actually sounds really familiar to me because I'm originally from Iran.

03:57.320 --> 04:01.400
And this is a mistake that a lot of Western governments from the perspective of people

04:01.400 --> 04:07.320
like me who are, we're totally in favor of not reform, but overthrowing of the Islamic

04:07.320 --> 04:12.080
Republic government in Iran, the regime, because there is a supreme leader who is electing,

04:12.080 --> 04:15.640
I'm sure you know that a bunch of people who are unelected, but the people who are the

04:15.640 --> 04:20.560
Westerners are negotiating with are the people who are presenting the government, president

04:20.560 --> 04:22.000
and all of that.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.400
And exactly because of that, and this is the thing with China, any kind of an agreement

04:26.400 --> 04:31.880
like the nuclear agreement, we had no confidence that Iranians will abide to that agreement.

04:31.880 --> 04:38.280
So how does the system, duality of the system works with respect to let's say these recent

04:38.280 --> 04:43.880
talks with the Chinese, you can say Chinese government because obviously they're not communicating

04:43.880 --> 04:45.240
with the Chinese party.

04:45.240 --> 04:46.240
Right.

04:46.240 --> 04:51.720
Well, I mean, as you know, most agreements that we've had with the Chinese Communist

04:51.720 --> 04:57.640
Party or the PRC have not actually, they have not fulfilled their end of the bargain.

04:57.640 --> 05:05.040
And so when you look at the trade agreement, essentially what happened is that we essentially

05:05.040 --> 05:12.880
forego the 15 December proposed tariffs and then also reduce some of the existing tariffs.

05:12.880 --> 05:20.040
And so if you look at, since we did that already, and you're looking at who's going to fulfill

05:20.040 --> 05:24.360
their side of the agreement, if you look at the fact that they don't actually fulfill

05:24.360 --> 05:30.240
their side of the agreement, what they were able to negotiate was in effect a delay of

05:30.240 --> 05:35.920
the December 15 tariffs and the reduction of the current tariffs.

05:35.920 --> 05:36.920
That's what they negotiated.

05:36.920 --> 05:42.560
I mean, this is typical for the way that the United States negotiates with the Chinese

05:42.560 --> 05:44.160
Communist Party.

05:44.160 --> 05:49.280
We will automatically hold up our end of the bargain and they just won't fulfill theirs.

05:49.280 --> 05:55.360
And so it's hard to get Americans to understand that when you negotiate, you have to wait

05:55.360 --> 06:01.960
to see if they're actually going to respect that agreement before you implement, have

06:01.960 --> 06:06.320
some kind of leverage in the negotiation at all times.

06:06.320 --> 06:11.280
Because for the Chinese, an agreement is the beginning of negotiations anyway.

06:11.280 --> 06:12.280
Yeah.

06:12.280 --> 06:15.920
I want to talk about your book Stealth War, but since we're talking about trade agreement,

06:15.920 --> 06:18.440
I just want to read for our audience.

06:18.440 --> 06:25.400
There are seven deadly sins that is presented by, I believe, Peter Navarro with respect

06:25.400 --> 06:30.800
to the Chinese agreement that stop stealing our intellectual property, stop forcing technology

06:30.800 --> 06:36.080
transfers, stop hacking our computers, stop dumping into our markets and putting our companies

06:36.080 --> 06:41.840
out of business, stop state-owned enterprise from heavy subsidies, stop the importation

06:41.840 --> 06:44.800
of fentanyl and stop the currency manipulation.

06:44.800 --> 06:51.080
How exactly is United States going to make the Chinese stop doing any of these things?

06:51.080 --> 06:52.640
Forget about seven of them.

06:52.640 --> 06:55.320
Yeah, we're not going to.

06:55.320 --> 06:58.440
The Chinese Communist Party is going to do what they want to do.

06:58.440 --> 07:05.640
I think the problem with our system is because most of corporate America and Wall Street

07:05.640 --> 07:13.120
have essentially aligned themselves with the model that currently exists, the tariffs introduce

07:13.120 --> 07:17.440
disruption into their supply chains, into their businesses, and so they just want them

07:17.440 --> 07:19.240
to go away.

07:19.240 --> 07:24.560
They're not concerned about the erosion of the economic competitiveness of the United

07:24.560 --> 07:30.560
States or the social fabric of the country, or even given the fact that there's no equal

07:30.560 --> 07:35.400
playing field either here in the United States when it comes to China and U.S. companies

07:35.400 --> 07:38.000
or in China.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.720
Not to mention, so those seven things you mentioned.

07:40.720 --> 07:47.640
Just remember, Facebook, Amazon, Google, Twitter, these companies that are making money around

07:47.640 --> 07:52.160
the world are not even allowed to operate within China, so never mind the fact that

07:52.160 --> 07:57.200
Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent, which are essentially the Chinese equivalents, are freely operating

07:57.200 --> 07:58.200
in the West.

07:58.200 --> 08:04.200
In fact, in a taxi in New York now, you can pay with Alipay, so they're actually allowing

08:04.200 --> 08:07.400
electronic payments through these systems.

08:07.400 --> 08:12.520
It's amazing the level of access that their companies are granted and our companies are

08:12.520 --> 08:14.320
not.

08:14.320 --> 08:18.680
I think this makes a lot of sense based on the title of your book.

08:18.680 --> 08:22.080
I actually noticed this today that's come to my mind.

08:22.080 --> 08:26.880
It's called Stealth War, How China Took Over While America's Elites Slept.

08:26.880 --> 08:31.920
You're not saying how China is taking over, how China took over, so from your perspective,

08:31.920 --> 08:32.920
it's over.

08:32.920 --> 08:33.920
China has taken over already.

08:33.920 --> 08:41.880
Yeah, and you can see that, for instance, in 2017 in June, the EU, for the first time,

08:41.880 --> 08:52.240
declined to essentially put in to support a sanction at the UN on China for human rights.

08:52.240 --> 09:01.840
At the same time, last month, there was a motion to condemn China for what they're doing

09:01.840 --> 09:09.680
with the concentration camps and the Uyghurs in Xinjiang or East Turkestan, and 54 countries

09:09.680 --> 09:10.680
sided with China.

09:10.680 --> 09:13.640
I think 32 sided with the United States.

09:13.640 --> 09:19.760
If you look at the UN Human Rights Council, Venezuela was recently added to be on the

09:19.760 --> 09:21.360
Human Rights Council.

09:21.360 --> 09:29.440
China is trying to change the definition of human rights so that providing economic benefit

09:29.440 --> 09:35.520
to the population is the paramount human right that a government should provide, and all

09:35.520 --> 09:39.720
other rights essentially go to the government leadership.

09:39.720 --> 09:46.600
There was recently a change in the head of agriculture at the UN, which does a lot of

09:46.600 --> 09:52.520
the food donations on behalf of the United Nations.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.760
He leads that effort.

09:54.760 --> 10:00.800
There was a U.S. candidate that was a Georgian secretary of agriculture, not the state of

10:00.800 --> 10:05.800
Georgia, but the country of Georgia, and the Chinese had a candidate of their own.

10:05.800 --> 10:08.400
A Chinese candidate won that position.

10:08.400 --> 10:14.240
In the World Bank, it was recently revealed that China has been lent by the World Bank

10:14.240 --> 10:20.720
$60 billion and recently put through a motion in secret to ensure that they get a billion

10:20.720 --> 10:25.480
to a billion and a half each year thereafter, really into perpetuity.

10:25.480 --> 10:31.480
They put Chinese in place in directorships within the bank to ensure that they control

10:31.480 --> 10:34.800
all of the things that are going on within the bank.

10:34.800 --> 10:42.880
They even had a loan from the World Bank that they applied for that was going to allow them

10:42.880 --> 10:48.240
to put cameras up in Xinjiang to monitor Uighurs.

10:48.240 --> 10:53.000
By the way, they got $60 billion out of the Asian Development Bank.

10:53.000 --> 10:59.800
The WTO doesn't really have the ability to enforce it across every international institution.

10:59.800 --> 11:03.640
These international institutions that were created, by the way, to promote democratic

11:03.640 --> 11:09.920
principles, human rights, civil liberties, rule of law, free trade, they're essentially

11:09.920 --> 11:17.000
now promoting Chinese Communist Party national interests, which are really to benefit the

11:17.000 --> 11:22.240
growing economy of China to provide employment for the Chinese people so that they don't

11:22.240 --> 11:25.200
overthrow them because they're an oppressive totalitarian regime.

11:25.200 --> 11:32.440
It's quite a simple model and we've played our part quite well.

11:32.440 --> 11:34.080
How did we get here?

11:34.080 --> 11:37.720
I also want to ask that what is the point of having any kind of negotiation if this

11:37.720 --> 11:44.000
is what's happening and basically, as you were saying, China has already taken over.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.280
I was just looking at the amount of money that they're spending in South America side

11:48.280 --> 11:52.520
by side with the amount of money that in four and eight United States is spending in South

11:52.520 --> 11:53.520
America.

11:53.520 --> 11:57.520
It's just something that is not even comparable and everything that they're doing, I guess

11:57.520 --> 12:01.800
on the back of their centralized system that the decision is being made on the central

12:01.800 --> 12:07.480
core of their system and then the solutions are being provided yet in America where we're

12:07.480 --> 12:12.920
arguing about whether or not Trump said we or me in the phone call with the Ukraine.

12:12.920 --> 12:14.840
How did we get here?

12:14.840 --> 12:22.760
At the end of the Cold War, we basically said our foreign policy became about integrating

12:22.760 --> 12:27.040
all of these authoritarian countries into the open system.

12:27.040 --> 12:33.120
We believed by integrating them into the open system by allowing them to have economic growth

12:33.120 --> 12:38.520
that over time, free trade or open markets would lead to wealth and then wealth would

12:38.520 --> 12:41.040
lead to democracy in these countries.

12:41.040 --> 12:46.240
Basically what happened, that happened for a time, but then the authoritarian regimes

12:46.240 --> 12:50.680
got wise, particularly led by China after Tiananmen Massacre.

12:50.680 --> 12:55.720
They realized that they needed to have access to the technology, talent, innovation and

12:55.720 --> 13:00.320
capital of the West, but they needed to protect themselves from democratic principles and

13:00.320 --> 13:02.860
so they created things like the Great Firewall.

13:02.860 --> 13:08.560
They forced indoctrination at all grade levels in the universities and in the schools.

13:08.560 --> 13:14.200
So everywhere from kindergarten to university, you're taught about the primacy of the Communist

13:14.200 --> 13:15.200
Party.

13:15.200 --> 13:20.280
All textbooks have been rewritten, libraries have been scrubbed of anything that resembles

13:20.280 --> 13:23.920
history that doesn't toe the Chinese Communist Party line.

13:23.920 --> 13:28.040
In fact, online journals in China have been scrubbed.

13:28.040 --> 13:33.720
There was one, the China Quarterly, which is a famous UK publication with regard to

13:33.720 --> 13:34.720
China.

13:34.720 --> 13:41.440
They sent out certain articles in that publication voluntarily because the Chinese Communist

13:41.440 --> 13:45.120
Party told the Cambridge University that they needed to do that.

13:45.120 --> 13:51.000
So there's been this wholesale scrub of all knowledge and all history and all education

13:51.000 --> 13:58.280
and all media within China in order to suppress any knowledge of either the Chinese people

13:58.280 --> 14:02.640
own history or the history of democracies or freedom.

14:02.640 --> 14:09.320
So in other words, what they try to do is make sure that you never have access to speak

14:09.320 --> 14:14.720
about democracy or learn about democracy and then you don't know what democracy is.

14:14.720 --> 14:23.160
Essentially, that is how they're able to keep their power going in a globalized, fully connected,

14:23.160 --> 14:24.880
internet powered world.

14:24.880 --> 14:29.880
And it seems like they're using their market size as a leverage to pretty much practice

14:29.880 --> 14:30.880
the same perspective.

14:30.880 --> 14:36.160
Here in the United States, we started with NBA, we started with Disney.

14:36.160 --> 14:37.160
Is there any hope?

14:37.160 --> 14:44.880
Yes, there's hope and really the hope lies in creating a separation from the Chinese

14:44.880 --> 14:47.720
Communist Party from the free world.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.840
It has to be a decoupling.

14:51.840 --> 14:58.120
The only engagement that really serves the interests of any free country with the Chinese

14:58.120 --> 15:04.440
Communist Party is one that seeks to do diplomatic engagement at the highest levels to prevent

15:04.440 --> 15:08.360
conflict or confrontation in a military sense.

15:08.360 --> 15:14.200
Anything else that seeks to cooperatively bring them into the international order in

15:14.200 --> 15:19.920
a way that will see them promoting the norms and principles and values of that system is

15:19.920 --> 15:26.760
bound to fail because their Communist Party constitution essentially repudiates that.

15:26.760 --> 15:32.000
Also document number 13, which was an internal Communist Party document leaked after Xi Jinping

15:32.000 --> 15:39.800
came to power, essentially outlines why universal human rights are actually tied to destroying

15:39.800 --> 15:42.520
the Chinese Communist Party and must be suppressed everywhere.

15:42.520 --> 15:49.500
So it is within their ideology to suppress freedoms and democratic principles and human

15:49.500 --> 15:54.240
rights all over the world because they're afraid that that might take root in China.

15:54.240 --> 16:00.160
So it's all against all the values and ideals of the Western civilization yet a lot of countries

16:00.160 --> 16:04.160
in the West are aligned with the Chinese direction and Chinese perspective.

16:04.160 --> 16:10.640
I lived in Canada for 11 years and Canada seemed to have a very big problem with respect

16:10.640 --> 16:15.320
to allowing Huawei building their 5G infrastructure.

16:15.320 --> 16:19.280
Maybe we talk a little about 5G, what 5G is because a lot of people think that this is

16:19.280 --> 16:25.400
just going to be a faster internet connection but the reality is that platform and the network

16:25.400 --> 16:27.840
are becoming one with 5G.

16:27.840 --> 16:33.120
Would you expand on that and explain the dangers of it if the infrastructure of 5G is built

16:33.120 --> 16:34.360
by the Chinese?

16:34.360 --> 16:39.640
Yeah, everybody is I think quite aware that companies like Google and Amazon and Facebook

16:39.640 --> 16:44.640
collect your data and do what they want with it, you know, extensively to provide you better

16:44.640 --> 16:49.640
goods and services that really match what you're looking for, almost try to predict

16:49.640 --> 16:55.040
what you're thinking because, you know, when you talk about something, you know, your voice

16:55.040 --> 16:59.540
will be picked up and then all of a sudden you're seeing ads for that thing.

16:59.540 --> 17:06.160
This is both from a technology platform that the iPhone and Android are the two predominant

17:06.160 --> 17:12.120
platforms for that system and then in a mobile sense the 4G network is a pipe.

17:12.120 --> 17:17.320
Now, that's allowed the United States since it was the first one to come up with a smartphone

17:17.320 --> 17:23.160
and really the second country to build a 4G network to be predominant in the global economy,

17:23.160 --> 17:31.520
you know, since really, you know, 2015 or so and those companies continue to extract

17:31.520 --> 17:36.080
data from around the world and create value for those companies and the Chinese really

17:36.080 --> 17:40.240
figured this out and wanted to do the same thing for 5G.

17:40.240 --> 17:45.680
So what you alluded to 5G as a platform, I think this is where people are really confused

17:45.680 --> 17:47.360
about what 5G is.

17:47.360 --> 17:52.680
It's not about providing you a faster cell phone, it's really about allowing you to decouple

17:52.680 --> 17:57.120
yourself from the cell phone, to leave the cell phone behind because it's built into

17:57.120 --> 17:58.120
the world around you.

17:58.120 --> 18:08.560
You walk outside, you say Uber and Uber shows up because a camera basically saw you recognize

18:08.560 --> 18:15.320
your face using artificial intelligence, read your lips or a microphone picked up your voice,

18:15.320 --> 18:18.520
realize you wanted to Uber and send it to you and then you get in the car and it takes

18:18.520 --> 18:19.780
you on your way.

18:19.780 --> 18:25.040
And so all of these services are going to be built into the city around you.

18:25.040 --> 18:27.000
That's the idea behind smart cities.

18:27.000 --> 18:32.760
The challenge for democracy is the challenge that we have with China because as those networks

18:32.760 --> 18:39.240
get built and as Baidu and Alibaba and Tencent essentially from behind the great firewall

18:39.240 --> 18:45.400
perfect the apps, services and business models of the 5G world and begin to deploy them around

18:45.400 --> 18:51.280
the world, then they'll have the ability to really challenge Facebook, Amazon and Netflix

18:51.280 --> 18:57.800
and Google in their space and really dominate those and over time what you'll see is strategic

18:57.800 --> 19:00.240
partnerships or mergers happen with those.

19:00.240 --> 19:06.200
And so when that happens, you've got Baidu essentially overtaking Google, essentially

19:06.200 --> 19:12.120
Facebook being dominated by Tencent and then you've got Alibaba taking over Amazon.

19:12.120 --> 19:20.640
And when you have that, then you have the power to use that data not just to make money

19:20.640 --> 19:25.920
for those companies, but also to collect intelligence and surveillance.

19:25.920 --> 19:32.640
So people would listen to this and say, oh, this is just me being alarmist.

19:32.640 --> 19:38.020
But there's a report out of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute by Samantha Hoffman

19:38.020 --> 19:40.000
called Engineering Global Consent.

19:40.000 --> 19:46.560
And that report basically talks about a company called Global Tone Communication Corporation.

19:46.560 --> 19:53.200
This is a big data AI company that's in China that collects data to do translation in 65

19:53.200 --> 19:54.200
languages.

19:54.200 --> 20:00.200
They use it for, they use machine learning to essentially translate languages for you

20:00.200 --> 20:02.480
of teleconferences.

20:02.480 --> 20:06.080
That technology is built into some Huawei products.

20:06.080 --> 20:10.900
In any case, they collect two to three petabytes of data per year.

20:10.900 --> 20:13.900
One petabyte is 1000 terabytes.

20:13.900 --> 20:18.760
So the interesting thing about Global Tone Communication Corporation is that they're

20:18.760 --> 20:26.720
owned collectively by the Ministry of Finance in the PRC in the propaganda arm or the United

20:26.720 --> 20:29.400
Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist Party.

20:29.400 --> 20:35.600
So that two to three petabytes of data, in addition to being used to translate language,

20:35.600 --> 20:41.600
go to the intelligence apparatus of the Chinese regime and the influence apparatus of the

20:41.600 --> 20:42.680
Chinese regime.

20:42.680 --> 20:46.680
So this is what's happening with 5G.

20:46.680 --> 20:54.440
Because you're decoupled from your smartphone, you no longer have an ability to opt out because

20:54.440 --> 20:58.360
when you could basically say, I'm not going to own a smartphone, therefore people aren't

20:58.360 --> 21:00.600
going to be able to collect data about me.

21:00.600 --> 21:03.940
Now because it's built into the city around you, there's no opting out.

21:03.940 --> 21:09.840
It is essentially, what I would expect to see happening is even if Huawei is not building

21:09.840 --> 21:15.960
a network in your town, Baidu is putting up cameras right now so that they can begin to

21:15.960 --> 21:22.400
collect information so that they can help make money selling you services like Uber,

21:22.400 --> 21:27.600
creating these virtual button pushes but also begin to know more about you so that if you

21:27.600 --> 21:35.680
do at any time decide to have something of relevance to Chinese national interests, then

21:35.680 --> 21:37.840
they'll have some kind of hooks into you.

21:37.840 --> 21:42.200
So I've been asked, what would be the future of a world like this?

21:42.200 --> 21:46.160
And the future is essentially this, that you come home every single day and you teach your

21:46.160 --> 21:50.880
child as they grow what things they can say and what things they can't say to prevent

21:50.880 --> 21:57.360
from angering the Chinese Communist Party and bringing financial ruin on the family.

21:57.360 --> 22:01.840
And people say, okay, well that would never happen.

22:01.840 --> 22:08.160
And I have friends that have lived here in the US for a long time, five years.

22:08.160 --> 22:13.360
Their kids have grown up in the school system and then around the time that they get ready

22:13.360 --> 22:19.200
to move back to China, they're having to begin to re-educate their children about what they

22:19.200 --> 22:24.280
can say and what they can't say as they go back into China to prevent exactly what I'm

22:24.280 --> 22:25.680
talking about from happening.

22:25.680 --> 22:30.280
So as we're so connected using globalization and the internet-

22:30.280 --> 22:34.080
I'm sorry, don't mind the dogs in the background.

22:34.080 --> 22:37.960
I have two of those too.

22:37.960 --> 22:42.280
One of the things I keep talking about to my audience is that technology is progressing

22:42.280 --> 22:45.720
exponentially while our perception is linear.

22:45.720 --> 22:48.480
So it's not like we can't expect the change.

22:48.480 --> 22:54.280
It's like people don't even remember how things were 20 years ago, before mainstream internet

22:54.280 --> 22:56.560
and smartphones and all that.

22:56.560 --> 23:01.160
And this self-censorship that you're talking about, I imagine it would take only a generation

23:01.160 --> 23:05.400
because it's like the five monkey experiment that you start whatever monkey reaches for

23:05.400 --> 23:09.880
that banana on top of the ladder.

23:09.880 --> 23:16.600
It is literally today with Chinese people that live in China, it is subconsciously done.

23:16.600 --> 23:23.960
It is so automatic to the way that they live because it just becomes built into the system.

23:23.960 --> 23:30.520
And there's an element of once you don't have an access to anything like books or any kind

23:30.520 --> 23:35.440
of outside information that gives you any idea that the world could be in any way different,

23:35.440 --> 23:39.000
then it really constrains how you think about the world.

23:39.000 --> 23:44.760
Yeah, I think North Korea is a very good example how this model when it goes extreme, I remember

23:44.760 --> 23:45.760
watching something.

23:45.760 --> 23:51.160
Wolf Blitzer was in Pyongyang and in each apartment there was a radio that plays propaganda

23:51.160 --> 23:52.160
24-7.

23:52.160 --> 23:54.960
You can't turn it down, but you can't turn it off.

23:54.960 --> 24:00.480
And I think people here are, they just don't get the intention of the Chinese that is very

24:00.480 --> 24:01.860
hegemonic.

24:01.860 --> 24:07.240
They're doing it with a one belt, one road initiative that I'm showing it to our viewers

24:07.240 --> 24:12.800
right now that they basically want to build a new Silk Road, but this is not on the basis

24:12.800 --> 24:17.960
of consent by countries who are involved.

24:17.960 --> 24:20.160
They are buying their ports in a way.

24:20.160 --> 24:24.640
They're buying their debts, which can be called, I guess, debt colonization, but they're doing

24:24.640 --> 24:26.760
the very same thing with data.

24:26.760 --> 24:31.200
That is a very alien concept to majority of people in the West.

24:31.200 --> 24:34.560
What do you mean by data colonization?

24:34.560 --> 24:36.480
So I just don't know.

24:36.480 --> 24:41.520
As I said, even if the United States manages to decouple from the Chinese, it seems like

24:41.520 --> 24:46.640
we have to rethink our entire alliances because Canada is going the Chinese way, a lot of

24:46.640 --> 24:49.160
European countries are going the Chinese way.

24:49.160 --> 24:54.080
So is it going to be that China will be in control of the majority of the world and United

24:54.080 --> 24:59.640
States would be this isolationist literally building the wall and a firewall, the United

24:59.640 --> 25:05.880
States will become a new Chinese model that we just block everything, all access to outside

25:05.880 --> 25:08.560
information just to be safe.

25:08.560 --> 25:12.520
Yeah, unfortunately, the mainstream media doesn't really pick up the fact that there's

25:12.520 --> 25:16.240
been a quiet effort at diplomacy throughout the Trump administration.

25:16.240 --> 25:26.040
It really started in 2018 where we put a lot of work in 2017 in the strategy in identifying

25:26.040 --> 25:30.360
the problem and really refining the message.

25:30.360 --> 25:36.440
And then in 2018, the administration began to have bilateral discussions with allies

25:36.440 --> 25:40.720
and partners to say, hey, here's the challenge, we've got to change our system to protect

25:40.720 --> 25:41.720
ourselves.

25:41.720 --> 25:45.480
And so now you're seeing country after country in the EU begin to say, hey, we're not going

25:45.480 --> 25:46.480
to build Huawei.

25:46.480 --> 25:48.080
Now, we've got a long ways to go.

25:48.080 --> 25:53.920
But what I can tell you is that I'm fairly confident now that as you look across the

25:53.920 --> 25:58.920
European landscape, developed countries, particularly ones that are allies and partners of the United

25:58.920 --> 26:04.640
States are choosing not to align themselves with the Chinese in ways that are counter

26:04.640 --> 26:07.400
to what we tell them or that we don't want to see.

26:07.400 --> 26:12.080
And so that I think is a good news story.

26:12.080 --> 26:19.000
I think the challenge remains for the emerging market world and certainly those other authoritarian

26:19.000 --> 26:23.280
regimes that are going to say very closely tied to China, you're going to see countries

26:23.280 --> 26:28.080
in Africa and Latin America and really some of the poor countries in Asia and Central

26:28.080 --> 26:34.120
Asia really continue to be on the side of China because they provide them very cheap

26:34.120 --> 26:39.540
things as you alluded to and provides for economic development.

26:39.540 --> 26:45.760
That being said, over time, the idea is to focus on growing and strengthening democracies,

26:45.760 --> 26:50.600
their economies, their science and technology, their STEM education, their infrastructure,

26:50.600 --> 26:52.680
their manufacturing base.

26:52.680 --> 26:56.880
So all of that is a long term effort.

26:56.880 --> 27:02.720
We got into this position over three decades with this close relationship with China.

27:02.720 --> 27:09.320
It's going to take probably at least a decade for us to begin to create a different alternative

27:09.320 --> 27:15.040
so that those other nations that have been kind of blinded by China can look up and see,

27:15.040 --> 27:18.200
okay, that model is not working so great anymore for me.

27:18.200 --> 27:19.960
Maybe I'm going to try this other model.

27:19.960 --> 27:24.140
I mean, this is why we were so successful in the Cold War.

27:24.140 --> 27:29.120
We focused on strengthening democracies and promoting them and allowing that system to

27:29.120 --> 27:32.840
be a beacon to those people that didn't live in that space.

27:32.840 --> 27:40.240
At the end of the Cold War, we abandoned that and let totalitarians essentially take innovation,

27:40.240 --> 27:46.520
technology, talent and capital, repackage it in their own ideals and re-export it to

27:46.520 --> 27:47.520
the world.

27:47.520 --> 27:50.680
This is something that we just cannot allow to continue.

27:50.680 --> 27:54.480
I think one of the best examples of what you talked about with respect to democracies,

27:54.480 --> 27:58.080
what is happening in Hong Kong that people are waving American flag.

27:58.080 --> 28:00.400
I have an American flag in my room.

28:00.400 --> 28:05.520
I had an American flag in Tehran and I smuggled it from Cyprus.

28:05.520 --> 28:10.720
It's not because we loved US government is that it represents certain kind of values

28:10.720 --> 28:13.920
and ideals.

28:13.920 --> 28:17.920
You mentioned Trump and I know that you work with the Trump administration.

28:17.920 --> 28:24.440
I'm supporting Trump reelection in 2020 and I know a lot of people who support him, majority

28:24.440 --> 28:31.320
of whom care about China and what we are doing with China as the priority of what's happening.

28:31.320 --> 28:36.000
Are you confident about Trump to be the best representative for American interest because

28:36.000 --> 28:40.920
I also see Joe Biden who sees that China is not going to eat our lunch, it's not that

28:40.920 --> 28:45.960
big of a deal and Michael Bloomberg, it seems like have a lot in common with the Chinese

28:45.960 --> 28:48.960
Communist Party.

28:48.960 --> 28:56.920
I think there's a confusion between personalities and politics and national security policy.

28:56.920 --> 29:00.080
I try to stay very focused on national security policy.

29:00.080 --> 29:06.240
I try to look at what are the things that the candidates are going to do.

29:06.240 --> 29:12.640
I got to say, I saw what Biden did with the Obama administration, I've heard what Bloomberg

29:12.640 --> 29:13.640
did.

29:13.640 --> 29:21.640
In the case of Bloomberg, his Bloomberg media did an article on Xi's family and about all

29:21.640 --> 29:23.240
the wealth that they had.

29:23.240 --> 29:31.440
So the Bloomberg terminals that represents the majority of his wealth, the Chinese Communist

29:31.440 --> 29:35.600
Party basically turned them off in China and said, don't do it again.

29:35.600 --> 29:41.160
Now Bloomberg media self-censors when it comes to reporting on corruption and things within

29:41.160 --> 29:45.480
China that have to do with the senior leaders of the Chinese Communist Party.

29:45.480 --> 29:54.200
So there is an element of establishment throughout our political system and these establishment

29:54.200 --> 30:00.040
politicians have essentially benefited by the system and want to perpetuate the system

30:00.040 --> 30:05.680
and that's why they talk about the negativity of tariffs and they talk about not wanting

30:05.680 --> 30:14.320
to not invest our retirement funds into Chinese companies that aren't subject to our standards

30:14.320 --> 30:18.160
for audit and transparency.

30:18.160 --> 30:22.840
For me, it is really about who's going to have the policies that actually protect the

30:22.840 --> 30:30.320
American people in this different way that the 21st century presents challenges to their

30:30.320 --> 30:32.120
continuing freedoms.

30:32.120 --> 30:37.480
That person is Trump or do you see any better?

30:37.480 --> 30:44.760
Having seen this, I think the Trump administration, at least today, is best positioned to do that.

30:44.760 --> 30:49.760
That being said, I don't know, I can't predict where the election outcome is going to be.

30:49.760 --> 30:57.540
I know that on the Democratic side of the House and a lot of established Republicans

30:57.540 --> 31:03.080
are leaving politics because I think there's a recognition that there is a change afoot

31:03.080 --> 31:08.280
in the United States and I think was brought on by the American people and so both parties

31:08.280 --> 31:14.880
I think have to address the challenges clearly, see the Chinese Communist Party for what it

31:14.880 --> 31:19.520
is, see the world for what it is and really figure out new ways to protect the American

31:19.520 --> 31:27.400
people and I think whatever candidate does that best will win in 2020.

31:27.400 --> 31:31.480
How do you feel about the current socio-political state in the United States?

31:31.480 --> 31:35.400
Because a lot of people believe that the country has never been more divided and the division

31:35.400 --> 31:40.200
is more apparent because of social media, how do you see it?

31:40.200 --> 31:52.040
There's a social welfare statistic that measured social satisfaction and I can't remember the

31:52.040 --> 31:59.400
name of it but in 2007 when the iPhone came out, US was number one on that and within

31:59.400 --> 32:07.840
10 years of that and certainly China's entry into the WTO, now it was number 17.

32:07.840 --> 32:14.000
So I think the loss of 70,000 factories, the loss of over 13 million jobs in the United

32:14.000 --> 32:20.320
States when we de-industrialized and really sent all manufacturing work to China and all

32:20.320 --> 32:26.520
the support jobs, I think that had a deep scarring impact on our society not to mention

32:26.520 --> 32:31.600
that those pension funds and retirement funds or those retirement funds and health benefits

32:31.600 --> 32:38.200
that went away added to the national debt in terms of entitlement so there was a knock-on

32:38.200 --> 32:45.840
effect from what happened when the US corporations essentially offloaded their manufacturing

32:45.840 --> 32:52.560
capacity to China, now they were able to increase their margins so now, for instance, Apple

32:52.560 --> 32:59.480
has cash on hand of about $260 billion and they've become a trillion dollar company by

32:59.480 --> 33:04.360
having these enormous margins but if you look at what they did, it was on the basis of slave

33:04.360 --> 33:11.880
labor and pollution so they created a country that produces 30% of the carbon in the entire

33:11.880 --> 33:19.200
world and really has almost like slave labor conditions in a lot of cases, particularly

33:19.200 --> 33:28.640
in the cases of Xinjiang and so what needs to happen is for that to be healed is for

33:28.640 --> 33:34.720
those communities within the United States to be made whole and that requires that we

33:34.720 --> 33:41.000
actually invest in industrial base in our manufacturing and infrastructure in research

33:41.000 --> 33:47.000
and development that actually drives economic growth and then reshoring the things that

33:47.000 --> 33:49.120
allow you to manufacture.

33:49.120 --> 33:54.960
Something about manufacturing jobs that I wonder about is that beside tax cuts and bringing

33:54.960 --> 33:59.960
jobs back to United States, it's also a matter of automation because unless you're going

33:59.960 --> 34:05.240
to nationalize companies or factories, how are you going to force them to hire American

34:05.240 --> 34:11.160
workers, for example, rather than just automate? I think Foxconn was a good example in Wisconsin

34:11.160 --> 34:16.560
that first they promised to build a plant and then we realized that they've already

34:16.560 --> 34:21.240
invested two plus billion dollars on automating their factories and then Trump called the

34:21.240 --> 34:28.040
head of the corporation and that's how it works. So how do you see this moving forward

34:28.040 --> 34:31.860
because that's actually one of the aspects of Trump administration, what he's talking

34:31.860 --> 34:36.040
about that long term, I just don't see how it's going to work out when we are entering

34:36.040 --> 34:37.440
the age of automation.

34:37.440 --> 34:42.600
Yeah, so there's actually three good labor studies. There's one by the Upjohn Institute,

34:42.600 --> 34:47.840
there's one by David Autor and colleagues at MIT and there's another one by the Economic

34:47.840 --> 34:53.240
Policy Institute. All of them take on this question of China entering the WTO. I think

34:53.240 --> 34:59.840
they all look at the question of automation, did all these jobs go away from automation?

34:59.840 --> 35:06.280
I think the Upjohn Institute did the best job of actually isolating semiconductor manufacture

35:06.280 --> 35:12.240
because of Moore's Law that was actually calculated as part of the productivity change. And so

35:12.240 --> 35:19.440
when you isolate for that industry alone and you look at the numbers, it's clear that the

35:19.440 --> 35:25.120
factory employment that went away was not because of automation, it was because factories

35:25.120 --> 35:32.720
moved to China. Now, I've talked to people that saw factories, you know, dismantled brick

35:32.720 --> 35:39.360
by brick, particularly a Corning glass factory that had just had maybe 300 million dollars

35:39.360 --> 35:46.360
of investment in it. And it was dismantled brick by brick and shipped to China and reassembled

35:46.360 --> 35:52.680
and was making glass. So this is what happened. The equipment, the tooling, the facilities,

35:52.680 --> 35:58.280
they were all moved to China for manufacturing. So some of those had automation and certainly

35:58.280 --> 36:03.320
were going to have increased automation, but the factories themselves still employed people

36:03.320 --> 36:12.440
and they're still going to employ some amount of people. So it's a convenient trope of theoretical

36:12.440 --> 36:21.480
economists to uphold this idea of free market economics. Now, free market economics theoretically

36:21.480 --> 36:27.480
work. Unfortunately, in practice, what we find is market failure always occurs because

36:27.480 --> 36:34.080
there's some company that seeks to dominate that industry or market. And when they do,

36:34.080 --> 36:39.000
they start acting monopolistically. Now, there's a good book by Matt Stoller that talks about

36:39.000 --> 36:45.160
the ebb and flow of monopolies versus, you know, the breakup of monopolies with regard

36:45.160 --> 36:51.320
to democracies. And so it's really a challenge for democracies today because we've had such

36:51.320 --> 36:57.800
consolidation in large corporations and the ownership of businesses have really been stripped

36:57.800 --> 37:02.960
from a lot of small business owners, particularly because of this, because of what China has

37:02.960 --> 37:08.680
done in terms of dominating industries and subsidizing them. Like if you're a factory

37:08.680 --> 37:13.800
owner in China, you don't pay for your electrical power that's given to you by the state. You

37:13.800 --> 37:20.560
know, all of these subsidies that come to you that really enable you to make a profit,

37:20.560 --> 37:24.600
these are things that the Chinese government do for a specific purpose. That's to create

37:24.600 --> 37:30.240
employment so they stay in control. And so for us to get back to where we need to be,

37:30.240 --> 37:37.400
the tariffs are so important. Just one part of the mechanism, there's a whole broad array

37:37.400 --> 37:43.920
of policy options that need to be brought to bear in order to change and rebalance this

37:43.920 --> 37:47.960
economic differential that we've essentially allowed to occur.

37:47.960 --> 37:53.640
Dr. Spalding's book is called Stealth War, How China Took Over While America's Elite

37:53.640 --> 38:01.400
Slept. It came out on October 1st, 2019. What made you write a book at this point and how

38:01.400 --> 38:03.480
the feedback has been so far?

38:03.480 --> 38:07.360
The feedback has been great. It's sold over 10,000 copies now.

38:07.360 --> 38:08.360
Congratulations.

38:08.360 --> 38:16.240
Thank you. In just two months. I'm literally getting emails from all over the world. People

38:16.240 --> 38:22.640
are reading the book. I just had a Polish language version published. I've had a Chinese

38:22.640 --> 38:28.960
language version that's just going to be published and released next month. I think it's really

38:28.960 --> 38:35.080
opening people's eyes to what's happened to the world and what we need to do to really

38:35.080 --> 38:37.960
put us back on track to promoting democracy.

38:37.960 --> 38:42.760
I imagine you have to deal with a lot of Chinese Communist Party trolls online as well as a

38:42.760 --> 38:47.320
consequence of your stance with respect to China, right?

38:47.320 --> 38:53.200
Actually it hasn't been that bad. I think part of the problem is I've been at this for

38:53.200 --> 39:00.040
so long that I've seen all the tricks. It's very hard for them to use the standard arguments.

39:00.040 --> 39:04.440
Once they're through the standard arguments, the Communist Party doesn't equip them with

39:04.440 --> 39:10.420
anything more. If you don't know how the system works, it's very easy to pull the wool over

39:10.420 --> 39:15.600
people's eyes. They have a harder time with me. I think they tend to stay away.

39:15.600 --> 39:18.040
Have you been to China yourself? I'm sure you've been.

39:18.040 --> 39:25.160
Yes. I lived there for two years from 2002 to 2004 in Shanghai. Loved it. Loved the people.

39:25.160 --> 39:30.440
Loved the language. I learned to speak it out of Defense Language Institute. It was

39:30.440 --> 39:35.000
a wonderful time. Quite frankly, at that point, I didn't understand the government or the

39:35.000 --> 39:41.600
party. It wasn't until later when I started working on it at the Pentagon. Then in 2016,

39:41.600 --> 39:47.360
I went to be the senior defense official in Beijing. I was essentially our country's military

39:47.360 --> 39:51.040
representative to China right before I went into the White House.

39:51.040 --> 39:55.880
It seems like everything blew up after Xi Jinping and after Trump. He made it a priority

39:55.880 --> 40:02.560
to talk about it. We see more clearly what's happening in Hong Kong and to a lower degree

40:02.560 --> 40:09.520
in Taiwan. We don't really know about the opposition to the government inside the mainland

40:09.520 --> 40:16.400
China. Xinjiang is one example. What is happening with respect to the rest of the country? You

40:16.400 --> 40:19.840
mentioned very correctly that if you don't get the information, if you don't know what

40:19.840 --> 40:25.120
is happening, there is no reason. Then it comes with self-censorship and all that. How

40:25.120 --> 40:30.800
do you assess the level of opposition and disagreement to the central government in

40:30.800 --> 40:31.800
the mainland China?

40:31.800 --> 40:38.800
There are tens of thousands of protests every year in China. It's usually around some corrupt

40:38.800 --> 40:44.400
official, local official that's doing something and really upsetting the people. They're putting

40:44.400 --> 40:50.640
in a power generation factory that's going to create pollution for the local community

40:50.640 --> 40:57.140
or somebody is essentially seizing land for some real estate deal that they want to make

40:57.140 --> 41:05.680
money on. The country is a totalitarian regime. It's not like Xinjiang everywhere, but certainly

41:05.680 --> 41:13.240
the arm of the state is there. It's funny because I remember living in Shanghai. I went

41:13.240 --> 41:19.240
to Beijing and I was in this market and I found this air raid siren and it looked really

41:19.240 --> 41:23.300
old and so I went and looked at it and I talked to the owner and he said he had bought it

41:23.300 --> 41:29.400
from a PLA warehouse, the People's Liberation Army warehouse. He said that they told him

41:29.400 --> 41:35.080
that it had been captured from Americans during the Korean War and sure enough it had US stamped

41:35.080 --> 41:36.080
on it.

41:36.080 --> 41:42.080
So I bought this thing and I was going to take it home and I had to have it shipped.

41:42.080 --> 41:46.560
Before I gave it to the shipping agent, I just wanted to try it out to see what it sounded

41:46.560 --> 41:52.480
like. Now, we were in the middle of the market. There's nobody there. I turned this siren

41:52.480 --> 42:02.080
on and it sounded like a loud air raid siren. Within just a matter of one minute, there

42:02.080 --> 42:12.120
was literally 50 officers around me. Before that, I hadn't seen any. They were coming

42:12.120 --> 42:16.220
to see what was going on and then when they saw what I was doing, they started laughing

42:16.220 --> 42:23.320
and all went away. It just gives you an idea of the apparatus that exists in the country

42:23.320 --> 42:30.700
that you're not aware of until something brings it out. In fact, you see that. The People's

42:30.700 --> 42:37.160
Armed Police and the Ministry of State Security are very large organs within the country and

42:37.160 --> 42:44.480
are able to suppress any dissent. Of course, you've got the 50 cent army online that does

42:44.480 --> 42:49.840
a good job of not preventing dissent. What they prevent is collective dissent. If you

42:49.840 --> 42:57.640
are a blogger or a poster and you put up things, sometimes they'll let you... If you're complaining

42:57.640 --> 43:02.640
about a local official, they'll let you do it, but as soon as two, three, 10 people start

43:02.640 --> 43:11.280
to follow you and it really become more of a collective protest, then they shut it down

43:11.280 --> 43:18.040
and delete everything. This was actually covered by a Harvard research study that showed that

43:18.040 --> 43:23.600
China had become very sophisticated in suppressing collective dissent. There's a lot of things

43:23.600 --> 43:29.760
that the apparatus does that are really hidden that you don't see when you live there. Quite

43:29.760 --> 43:36.600
frankly, because I was just there not causing any trouble, I never saw it. The first time,

43:36.600 --> 43:40.880
it wasn't until later than I really started trying to understand China and the Chinese

43:40.880 --> 43:48.040
Communist Party that I began to realize how deep the challenge was.

43:48.040 --> 43:54.220
I had to leave Iran as a political dissident and I was human trafficked through a number

43:54.220 --> 44:01.120
of countries including China. This is in 2006. We flew from Kuala Lumpur to Hong Kong, took

44:01.120 --> 44:09.480
a bus to the border and then took a cab into Guangzhou and then flew to Shanghai in Canada.

44:09.480 --> 44:12.720
Quite honestly, the way that they're dealing with their surveillance system, with social

44:12.720 --> 44:18.200
credit system, all the cameras, facial recognition, all that, I can't even imagine. I had no

44:18.200 --> 44:23.040
idea back then about anything that we're talking about with respect to China, but it seems

44:23.040 --> 44:28.520
like they have mastered the game of surveillance and they're using it to the best of their

44:28.520 --> 44:34.700
advantage. The Western countries are taking notice and they're like, oh, this is working

44:34.700 --> 44:40.200
really good for the Chinese government. Is there any kind of a threat of the so-called

44:40.200 --> 44:45.880
democratic governments in the West modeling for the sake of security and safety after

44:45.880 --> 44:49.160
the experiments that are being done by the Chinese government?

44:49.160 --> 44:56.920
I think right now it's mostly limited to those more authoritarian or emerging market economies,

44:56.920 --> 45:03.480
but the capability is incredible. In fact, I had somebody working for me at the embassy

45:03.480 --> 45:09.720
that got on one of those Mobikes. The Mobike is a bike that started showing up in Beijing

45:09.720 --> 45:16.280
in late 2016 where you could use your phone and scan a QR code. It would unlock the bike.

45:16.280 --> 45:22.800
You ride it somewhere and lock it and then it would charge you for however much distance

45:22.800 --> 45:27.960
you use. This guy left his iPad in the basket of the bike and went back to the embassy.

45:27.960 --> 45:33.320
He gets to the embassy, realizes he's forgot his iPad, goes in the regional security office,

45:33.320 --> 45:37.640
the regional security office calls the public security bureau and they immediately call

45:37.640 --> 45:45.920
the guy on the phone that's got the iPad. That's how connected the system is in Beijing

45:45.920 --> 45:55.520
now and increasingly throughout all of China. They just went live on 50 cities with 5G networks

45:55.520 --> 46:02.880
on 1 November of this year. That penetration of technology and surveillance system, both

46:02.880 --> 46:08.360
from because everybody uses a smartphone and are in the apps and China has access to that

46:08.360 --> 46:14.340
data plus the cameras with facial recognition, you really have this ability to monitor quite

46:14.340 --> 46:20.420
closely the population and incentivize them to do things that the Chinese Communist Party

46:20.420 --> 46:22.480
thinks make you a good citizen.

46:22.480 --> 46:25.920
Because of the firewall, the apps are very limited too. I think there are only two or

46:25.920 --> 46:31.540
three of them that people do everything with them basically from ordering food to go to

46:31.540 --> 46:35.480
chatting. Is that correct?

46:35.480 --> 46:42.520
The WeChat app can almost be considered a platform much like the iOS is a platform for

46:42.520 --> 46:49.800
the iPhone. You open the WeChat app and then once you open the WeChat app, you have all

46:49.800 --> 46:56.720
of these other apps that you can use to order airline tickets or order food or pay for things.

46:56.720 --> 47:02.520
It really is an incredible suite of tools. Of course, all of that data is collected by

47:02.520 --> 47:07.360
WeChat and then the Chinese Communist Party has access to it.

47:07.360 --> 47:12.600
That's part of the constitution that if the Chinese Communist Party asks for data or anything

47:12.600 --> 47:17.920
that the company has or a Western company that works within China, if they ask for information,

47:17.920 --> 47:18.920
they have to hand it over.

47:18.920 --> 47:20.280
They have to have it, yes.

47:20.280 --> 47:26.360
Yeah. I don't know what to say. It's kind of dystopian but it is what it is I guess.

47:26.360 --> 47:31.600
What can we learn from the Chinese because it's completely unfair to say that they haven't

47:31.600 --> 47:34.920
had the success. They had the model. They had the objective that they wanted to reach

47:34.920 --> 47:37.400
and they seem to be very successful at it.

47:37.400 --> 47:43.320
No. I think during the Cold War, particularly in the Eisenhower administration, the United

47:43.320 --> 47:47.360
States invested in infrastructure so we built things like the Eisenhower National Highway

47:47.360 --> 47:54.560
System. We invested in technology, R&D, research and development, basic science research. We

47:54.560 --> 48:02.440
invested in science, technology, engineering and math education. We created a lot of scientists

48:02.440 --> 48:07.920
particularly during the space race and then we invested in our manufacturing base. We

48:07.920 --> 48:18.000
had huge manufacturing areas like in Detroit. China for the last 30 years has been investing

48:18.000 --> 48:23.200
in their economy and in their people so that's one thing that I would say is quite laudable.

48:23.200 --> 48:29.760
We are today $5 trillion in arrears in infrastructure investment in the United States. We haven't

48:29.760 --> 48:37.080
been spending on, we were spending 2% of gross domestic product in the 60s in basic science

48:37.080 --> 48:43.600
research. Today it's less than 0.7% and most of that is going to the National Institute

48:43.600 --> 48:49.480
of Health and most of that, if not all of it, is also going to China on STEM education.

48:49.480 --> 48:54.640
We don't fund STEM education anymore. Most of the students now in STEM educational billets

48:54.640 --> 49:00.800
within the US universities are from China and then finally on manufacturing we've lost

49:00.800 --> 49:07.160
so many factories we can't manufacture things anymore and so we can begin to invest in our

49:07.160 --> 49:14.240
country and in our people. I think that's one. In terms of development of emerging market

49:14.240 --> 49:18.560
economies in ways that both connect them to the global economy but also provide for their

49:18.560 --> 49:26.040
population, if you look at our organizations like USAID, they'll get money that the Congress

49:26.040 --> 49:32.320
gives them to say do a water project in Ethiopia. It's not tied to any other thing and so these

49:32.320 --> 49:39.600
developmental projects from Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the TDA, XM Bank,

49:39.600 --> 49:45.800
USAID, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, none of these are focused on what I would

49:45.800 --> 49:50.880
call strategic investment for geopolitical reasons. So you're not just promoting the

49:50.880 --> 49:55.720
economies and the societies, you're also promoting the principles and the institutions

49:55.720 --> 50:00.840
of those same countries in ways that allow them to grow strong economically and prosperous

50:00.840 --> 50:07.440
but also begin to have the kind of rule of law and civil liberties that we want to promote.

50:07.440 --> 50:14.160
We could do a much better job of coordinating that activity but these are the things that

50:14.160 --> 50:18.960
we're going to have to learn from the Chinese in terms of development. They actually, they'll

50:18.960 --> 50:23.720
look at a country and they'll say hey, I need a raw material out of this country. I want

50:23.720 --> 50:28.560
to connect it to China so they can use it to manufacture. At the same time, I want to

50:28.560 --> 50:35.400
be able to sell to these people. So let's create the mine, the port, the rail, the roads,

50:35.400 --> 50:40.420
the telecommunications links, the water, the power. Once we have that, let's bring in low

50:40.420 --> 50:45.360
value added manufacturing, shoes, textiles. Let's put them to work. Okay, now we have

50:45.360 --> 50:51.080
that. Let's give them housing. Okay, now we have that. Let's start to sell them $50 smartphones.

50:51.080 --> 50:56.480
Let's get them WeChat. Let's get them some electronic payments. Let's get the government

50:56.480 --> 51:00.840
some cameras so they can start watching the population, make sure that they can round

51:00.840 --> 51:05.520
up their troublemakers. We'll show them how to do all that. And now you've got a built-in

51:05.520 --> 51:11.720
kind of IT-based authoritarian society that's fully plugged into China and can be part of

51:11.720 --> 51:17.160
its ecosystem. This is, and oh, by the way, in doing all that, they've moved a lot of

51:17.160 --> 51:25.120
their population of excess males in China into that country. They did the original construction.

51:25.120 --> 51:29.400
They do manufacturing. They start businesses to the tunes of tens of thousands of people

51:29.400 --> 51:36.280
that come from China into these countries. And then you create this outside force that

51:36.280 --> 51:41.320
actually is very supportive of the regime because they're economically and financially

51:41.320 --> 51:47.440
tied into it. So, I mean, it's a really good, smart model on the terms of what they've done.

51:47.440 --> 51:51.840
I call it building, not breaking. You know, the chief export of the United States has

51:51.840 --> 51:56.920
been breaking things using war in the last two decades. I think in the next two decades,

51:56.920 --> 52:01.720
we can say we've been builders and not breakers. I think we're going to be successful in kind

52:01.720 --> 52:05.480
of countering the rise of totalitarianism in our world.

52:05.480 --> 52:09.960
That's an excellent message. A lot of our audience are from Canada. Do you have any

52:09.960 --> 52:15.960
thoughts with respect to the relationship between Canada and China, especially how Canada

52:15.960 --> 52:21.640
has detained the daughter of the CEO of Huawei and two Canadians are still taking basically

52:21.640 --> 52:25.400
hostages, political hostages in China? Do you have any thoughts on that?

52:25.400 --> 52:30.440
Yeah. So, I mean, I think it's about rule of law versus rule by law. I think Meng Wanzhou

52:30.440 --> 52:40.040
clearly has been indicted for bank fraud. There's a lot of, I mean, ZTE, for instance,

52:40.040 --> 52:44.400
does it directly. I mean, they were sending fraud payments directly from the headquarters.

52:44.400 --> 52:50.680
I think they were doing this in order to support the Iranian regime, you know, by selling them

52:50.680 --> 52:58.360
goods. This is indisputable. The evidence is clear. It wasn't done to have trade leverage.

52:58.360 --> 53:04.040
It was done because she broke the law. And quite frankly, Huawei and many other companies

53:04.040 --> 53:11.560
continue to do things that violate rules and norms. In terms of the Canadian individuals

53:11.560 --> 53:16.840
that are detained, it's not clear that they did anything. In fact, we know that China

53:16.840 --> 53:22.360
does extrajudicial detainment all the time for the purposes of whatever they want to do.

53:22.360 --> 53:26.440
You know, you say you're the head of a, you're the billion dollar head of a company.

53:27.080 --> 53:32.040
You angered the Communist Party. Guess what? You're going to go away for a while.

53:32.040 --> 53:37.720
You may be even permanently. You know, this is the way China works. There is no due process.

53:37.720 --> 53:45.480
There is no, you know, right to see an attorney or have any kind of justice's blind scenario.

53:45.480 --> 53:50.920
It is the Communist Party is the law. And that's they make the decision what's going to happen to

53:50.920 --> 53:56.920
you. And so, you know, I think, you know, from Canada's standpoint, I mean, there's only one

53:56.920 --> 54:01.880
choice. It's really is, you know, promoting and supporting the rule of law, civil liberties,

54:01.880 --> 54:07.880
human rights, democratic principles, free trade, the things that we try to instantiate in international

54:07.880 --> 54:14.280
order after World War Two. And that's what the United States is trying to do. And despite

54:14.280 --> 54:19.640
all of this noise that says we're trying to be isolationist. No, we're trying to not destroy

54:19.640 --> 54:25.400
the international system. We're trying to in some ways rebuild it. So it begins to be, you know,

54:25.400 --> 54:30.280
the Human Rights Council can be the Human Rights Council and not the Human Wrongs Council. That's

54:30.280 --> 54:34.920
going to take a lot of work. And we're going to have to work with allies and partners. Like I said,

54:34.920 --> 54:39.800
our diplomats have been talking to them. And I think if you would, if you look at the bureaucratic

54:39.800 --> 54:46.040
level of a lot of these countries, governments, you know, that are especially democracies, they've

54:46.040 --> 54:50.840
heard this message from the United States quite clearly. And they're trying to figure out how they

54:50.840 --> 54:54.520
implement, you know, the same kind of protections in their own societies.

54:54.520 --> 54:59.160
Yeah, the Human Rights Council that is led by Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, it's a bit of a head

54:59.160 --> 55:05.560
scratcher. Very much so. Dr. Spalding's book is called Stealth War, How China Took Over While

55:05.560 --> 55:11.320
America's Elite Slept. What is next for you? And where can our audience follow your future works?

55:11.320 --> 55:17.480
So I'm 2020. I'm just going to be talking about the challenge of totalitarianism, the rise of

55:17.480 --> 55:26.520
totalitarianism in the world. I just got back from Poland and Lithuania and the UK. I'm going to

55:26.520 --> 55:30.680
different countries and throughout the United States to talk about this using the book as a

55:30.680 --> 55:35.960
platform to start a dialogue. Let's have a conversation. You may not agree with everything

55:35.960 --> 55:43.080
that the United States stands for. And you may have some grievances because of some of the things

55:43.080 --> 55:47.160
that we've done in foreign policy. You may continue to have those grievances. But that doesn't

55:47.160 --> 55:53.160
preclude us from having a logical, you know, fact-based conversation about how we protect

55:54.040 --> 55:59.320
democracy in a globalized internet-powered world where, you know, our data is easily taken and used

55:59.320 --> 56:04.840
for things that we don't want it to be. I imagine that your book has created a lot of attention and

56:04.840 --> 56:10.280
traction in Japan as well. Is that right? Because Japanese seem to be on the forefront of the Chinese

56:11.160 --> 56:20.200
conflict. Yes, Japan, Australia, you know, countries like this, you know, in Europe,

56:20.200 --> 56:25.720
from the Baltic to the Mediterranean, most of those countries that were under the boot of the

56:25.720 --> 56:32.360
Soviet Union really are responding to the message. So I think it's, you know, my belief is we're on a

56:32.360 --> 56:38.600
good trajectory. We have to just keep working. We have to keep focusing on the challenges that

56:38.600 --> 56:43.640
we face and work on them together. Excellent. Let me ask you the last question I ask all my guests,

56:43.640 --> 56:48.280
that if you come across an intelligent alien from a different civilization, what would you say is

56:48.280 --> 56:52.120
the worst thing humanity has done? And what would you say is our greatest achievement?

56:52.120 --> 56:59.160
The worst thing that we've done is probably what's going on, some of the stuff that's going on in

56:59.160 --> 57:05.560
China right now, putting people in concentration camps and organ harvesting, I think, is absolutely

57:05.560 --> 57:12.760
horrendous. That being said, I think, you know, there are acts of kindness in our world every

57:12.760 --> 57:19.160
single day. And if we choose to see the good in people, then we're not going to be able to

57:19.160 --> 57:26.680
do that. If we choose to see the good in people, then, you know, that is where true humanity,

57:26.680 --> 57:54.120
humanity lies.
