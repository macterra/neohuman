1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
I call it building, not breaking.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,920
The chief export of the United States has been breaking things using war in the last

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,920
two decades.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,840
I think in the next two decades, we can say we've been builders and not breakers.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,720
I think we're going to be successful in kind of countering the rise of totalitarianism

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,840
in our world.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:29,760
Hello, and welcome to the 57th episode of Neohuman Podcast.

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,760
I'm a Gavahari etiologist on Twitter and Instagram, and you can follow the show on

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,320
LiveInLimbo.com, iTunes, YouTube, and BitChute.

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,320
And today with me, I have retired burgadier general Dr. Robert Spalding.

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,960
Welcome to Neohuman Podcast, Dr. Spalding.

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,960
Thank you.

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,960
Great to be here.

14
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,960
Yeah, it's a pleasure to have you.

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,000
How about we start from the beginning, the work you've done, the lives you've lived,

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,320
and what are you mainly focused on now these days?

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:04,360
Yeah, so I just retired from the Air Force after almost 27 years being a B-2 pilot and

18
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,480
spending a lot of time focused on China.

19
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:13,960
I'm a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute where I'm at today, but also working on educating

20
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:23,800
and advocating for understanding the challenges of closed systems being integrated with globalized

21
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,840
Internet-connected world.

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,480
Perhaps the best example for the closed system that you're focused on is the Chinese system.

23
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,480
Right.

24
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:37,400
Clearly, the Chinese Communist Party is the most predominant in that system, but there's

25
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,480
others.

26
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,960
How would you describe the Chinese Communist system?

27
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,480
Because for a lot of people, it's unclear.

28
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,800
Xi Jinping is called the president, but we don't remember an election, and then he was

29
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,840
elevated to become a lifelong president.

30
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,880
And I don't even think that they're calling him a president.

31
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,240
Is he a chairman for life?

32
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,440
How do you describe the system of their governance?

33
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,600
Yeah, well, I mean, it can be very confusing because they have a party and then they have

34
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,200
a government.

35
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,520
And in China, there's two constitutions.

36
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,200
There's the PRC, People's Republic of China constitution, and there's the Chinese Communist

37
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,880
Party constitution.

38
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:20,720
So it's actually confusing for governments as well because you interface diplomatically

39
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,540
with the government, but yet the sovereign, the one that makes the decisions for the country

40
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,080
is the party.

41
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,520
And so if you think about our State Department, for example, it represents the sovereign for

42
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:38,080
the country, and yet it interfaces with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which essentially

43
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,640
is part of the People's Republic of China structure.

44
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,920
But if you look at where the decisions are made, it's within the Chinese Communist Party.

45
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,480
So diplomatically, we don't even interface with the sovereign.

46
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:59,080
Now Xi is most widely known as president of China, but his real power comes from being

47
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,360
the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party.

48
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,440
This is the real authority within China.

49
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,600
He's known as a president even within China.

50
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,200
It's pretty clear his position that is, I don't want to say a dictator, but that's how

51
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,700
he's being referred to by a lot of people in the West.

52
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,280
So how do Chinese people look at him as?

53
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:26,400
Well, I think it depends on one of the affectionate terms that the Chinese Communist Party pushes

54
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,860
as Xi Dada, which is Papa Xi.

55
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:35,520
But he is the general secretary of the party, and that's where the power really resides.

56
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,480
And the same thing for provinces within China.

57
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,460
You'll have a provincial governor, but the real power in the province will be the head

58
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,800
of the Chinese Communist Party in that province.

59
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,240
And really, that is the way the system is run.

60
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,680
The party controls everything.

61
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,320
This system actually sounds really familiar to me because I'm originally from Iran.

62
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,400
And this is a mistake that a lot of Western governments from the perspective of people

63
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,320
like me who are, we're totally in favor of not reform, but overthrowing of the Islamic

64
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,080
Republic government in Iran, the regime, because there is a supreme leader who is electing,

65
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,640
I'm sure you know that a bunch of people who are unelected, but the people who are the

66
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,560
Westerners are negotiating with are the people who are presenting the government, president

67
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,000
and all of that.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,400
And exactly because of that, and this is the thing with China, any kind of an agreement

69
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,880
like the nuclear agreement, we had no confidence that Iranians will abide to that agreement.

70
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:38,280
So how does the system, duality of the system works with respect to let's say these recent

71
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,880
talks with the Chinese, you can say Chinese government because obviously they're not communicating

72
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,240
with the Chinese party.

73
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,240
Right.

74
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,720
Well, I mean, as you know, most agreements that we've had with the Chinese Communist

75
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,640
Party or the PRC have not actually, they have not fulfilled their end of the bargain.

76
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:05,040
And so when you look at the trade agreement, essentially what happened is that we essentially

77
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:12,880
forego the 15 December proposed tariffs and then also reduce some of the existing tariffs.

78
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:20,040
And so if you look at, since we did that already, and you're looking at who's going to fulfill

79
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,360
their side of the agreement, if you look at the fact that they don't actually fulfill

80
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,240
their side of the agreement, what they were able to negotiate was in effect a delay of

81
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,920
the December 15 tariffs and the reduction of the current tariffs.

82
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
That's what they negotiated.

83
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:42,560
I mean, this is typical for the way that the United States negotiates with the Chinese

84
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,160
Communist Party.

85
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,280
We will automatically hold up our end of the bargain and they just won't fulfill theirs.

86
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,360
And so it's hard to get Americans to understand that when you negotiate, you have to wait

87
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,960
to see if they're actually going to respect that agreement before you implement, have

88
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,320
some kind of leverage in the negotiation at all times.

89
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,280
Because for the Chinese, an agreement is the beginning of negotiations anyway.

90
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,280
Yeah.

91
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,920
I want to talk about your book Stealth War, but since we're talking about trade agreement,

92
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,440
I just want to read for our audience.

93
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:25,400
There are seven deadly sins that is presented by, I believe, Peter Navarro with respect

94
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,800
to the Chinese agreement that stop stealing our intellectual property, stop forcing technology

95
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,080
transfers, stop hacking our computers, stop dumping into our markets and putting our companies

96
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,840
out of business, stop state-owned enterprise from heavy subsidies, stop the importation

97
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,800
of fentanyl and stop the currency manipulation.

98
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:51,080
How exactly is United States going to make the Chinese stop doing any of these things?

99
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,640
Forget about seven of them.

100
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,320
Yeah, we're not going to.

101
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,440
The Chinese Communist Party is going to do what they want to do.

102
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:05,640
I think the problem with our system is because most of corporate America and Wall Street

103
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:13,120
have essentially aligned themselves with the model that currently exists, the tariffs introduce

104
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,440
disruption into their supply chains, into their businesses, and so they just want them

105
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,240
to go away.

106
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,560
They're not concerned about the erosion of the economic competitiveness of the United

107
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,560
States or the social fabric of the country, or even given the fact that there's no equal

108
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,400
playing field either here in the United States when it comes to China and U.S. companies

109
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,000
or in China.

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,720
Not to mention, so those seven things you mentioned.

111
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:47,640
Just remember, Facebook, Amazon, Google, Twitter, these companies that are making money around

112
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,160
the world are not even allowed to operate within China, so never mind the fact that

113
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,200
Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent, which are essentially the Chinese equivalents, are freely operating

114
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
in the West.

115
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:04,200
In fact, in a taxi in New York now, you can pay with Alipay, so they're actually allowing

116
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,400
electronic payments through these systems.

117
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,520
It's amazing the level of access that their companies are granted and our companies are

118
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,320
not.

119
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,680
I think this makes a lot of sense based on the title of your book.

120
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,080
I actually noticed this today that's come to my mind.

121
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,880
It's called Stealth War, How China Took Over While America's Elites Slept.

122
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,920
You're not saying how China is taking over, how China took over, so from your perspective,

123
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,920
it's over.

124
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,920
China has taken over already.

125
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:41,880
Yeah, and you can see that, for instance, in 2017 in June, the EU, for the first time,

126
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:52,240
declined to essentially put in to support a sanction at the UN on China for human rights.

127
00:08:52,240 --> 00:09:01,840
At the same time, last month, there was a motion to condemn China for what they're doing

128
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:09,680
with the concentration camps and the Uyghurs in Xinjiang or East Turkestan, and 54 countries

129
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,680
sided with China.

130
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,640
I think 32 sided with the United States.

131
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:19,760
If you look at the UN Human Rights Council, Venezuela was recently added to be on the

132
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,360
Human Rights Council.

133
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:29,440
China is trying to change the definition of human rights so that providing economic benefit

134
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,520
to the population is the paramount human right that a government should provide, and all

135
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,720
other rights essentially go to the government leadership.

136
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:46,600
There was recently a change in the head of agriculture at the UN, which does a lot of

137
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:52,520
the food donations on behalf of the United Nations.

138
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,760
He leads that effort.

139
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:00,800
There was a U.S. candidate that was a Georgian secretary of agriculture, not the state of

140
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,800
Georgia, but the country of Georgia, and the Chinese had a candidate of their own.

141
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,400
A Chinese candidate won that position.

142
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:14,240
In the World Bank, it was recently revealed that China has been lent by the World Bank

143
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:20,720
$60 billion and recently put through a motion in secret to ensure that they get a billion

144
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,480
to a billion and a half each year thereafter, really into perpetuity.

145
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,480
They put Chinese in place in directorships within the bank to ensure that they control

146
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,800
all of the things that are going on within the bank.

147
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:42,880
They even had a loan from the World Bank that they applied for that was going to allow them

148
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,240
to put cameras up in Xinjiang to monitor Uighurs.

149
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,000
By the way, they got $60 billion out of the Asian Development Bank.

150
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,800
The WTO doesn't really have the ability to enforce it across every international institution.

151
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,640
These international institutions that were created, by the way, to promote democratic

152
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:09,920
principles, human rights, civil liberties, rule of law, free trade, they're essentially

153
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:17,000
now promoting Chinese Communist Party national interests, which are really to benefit the

154
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,240
growing economy of China to provide employment for the Chinese people so that they don't

155
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,200
overthrow them because they're an oppressive totalitarian regime.

156
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:32,440
It's quite a simple model and we've played our part quite well.

157
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,080
How did we get here?

158
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,720
I also want to ask that what is the point of having any kind of negotiation if this

159
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:44,000
is what's happening and basically, as you were saying, China has already taken over.

160
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,280
I was just looking at the amount of money that they're spending in South America side

161
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,520
by side with the amount of money that in four and eight United States is spending in South

162
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,520
America.

163
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,520
It's just something that is not even comparable and everything that they're doing, I guess

164
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,800
on the back of their centralized system that the decision is being made on the central

165
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:07,480
core of their system and then the solutions are being provided yet in America where we're

166
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,920
arguing about whether or not Trump said we or me in the phone call with the Ukraine.

167
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,840
How did we get here?

168
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:22,760
At the end of the Cold War, we basically said our foreign policy became about integrating

169
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,040
all of these authoritarian countries into the open system.

170
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:33,120
We believed by integrating them into the open system by allowing them to have economic growth

171
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,520
that over time, free trade or open markets would lead to wealth and then wealth would

172
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,040
lead to democracy in these countries.

173
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,240
Basically what happened, that happened for a time, but then the authoritarian regimes

174
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,680
got wise, particularly led by China after Tiananmen Massacre.

175
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,720
They realized that they needed to have access to the technology, talent, innovation and

176
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,320
capital of the West, but they needed to protect themselves from democratic principles and

177
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,860
so they created things like the Great Firewall.

178
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:08,560
They forced indoctrination at all grade levels in the universities and in the schools.

179
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,200
So everywhere from kindergarten to university, you're taught about the primacy of the Communist

180
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,200
Party.

181
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,280
All textbooks have been rewritten, libraries have been scrubbed of anything that resembles

182
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,920
history that doesn't toe the Chinese Communist Party line.

183
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,040
In fact, online journals in China have been scrubbed.

184
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,720
There was one, the China Quarterly, which is a famous UK publication with regard to

185
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,720
China.

186
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:41,440
They sent out certain articles in that publication voluntarily because the Chinese Communist

187
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,120
Party told the Cambridge University that they needed to do that.

188
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:51,000
So there's been this wholesale scrub of all knowledge and all history and all education

189
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:58,280
and all media within China in order to suppress any knowledge of either the Chinese people

190
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,640
own history or the history of democracies or freedom.

191
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:09,320
So in other words, what they try to do is make sure that you never have access to speak

192
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,720
about democracy or learn about democracy and then you don't know what democracy is.

193
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:23,160
Essentially, that is how they're able to keep their power going in a globalized, fully connected,

194
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,880
internet powered world.

195
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,880
And it seems like they're using their market size as a leverage to pretty much practice

196
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,880
the same perspective.

197
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,160
Here in the United States, we started with NBA, we started with Disney.

198
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,160
Is there any hope?

199
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:44,880
Yes, there's hope and really the hope lies in creating a separation from the Chinese

200
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,720
Communist Party from the free world.

201
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,840
It has to be a decoupling.

202
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:58,120
The only engagement that really serves the interests of any free country with the Chinese

203
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:04,440
Communist Party is one that seeks to do diplomatic engagement at the highest levels to prevent

204
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,360
conflict or confrontation in a military sense.

205
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:14,200
Anything else that seeks to cooperatively bring them into the international order in

206
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:19,920
a way that will see them promoting the norms and principles and values of that system is

207
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:26,760
bound to fail because their Communist Party constitution essentially repudiates that.

208
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:32,000
Also document number 13, which was an internal Communist Party document leaked after Xi Jinping

209
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,800
came to power, essentially outlines why universal human rights are actually tied to destroying

210
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,520
the Chinese Communist Party and must be suppressed everywhere.

211
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:49,500
So it is within their ideology to suppress freedoms and democratic principles and human

212
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,240
rights all over the world because they're afraid that that might take root in China.

213
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,160
So it's all against all the values and ideals of the Western civilization yet a lot of countries

214
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,160
in the West are aligned with the Chinese direction and Chinese perspective.

215
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,640
I lived in Canada for 11 years and Canada seemed to have a very big problem with respect

216
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,320
to allowing Huawei building their 5G infrastructure.

217
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,280
Maybe we talk a little about 5G, what 5G is because a lot of people think that this is

218
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:25,400
just going to be a faster internet connection but the reality is that platform and the network

219
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,840
are becoming one with 5G.

220
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:33,120
Would you expand on that and explain the dangers of it if the infrastructure of 5G is built

221
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,360
by the Chinese?

222
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,640
Yeah, everybody is I think quite aware that companies like Google and Amazon and Facebook

223
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:44,640
collect your data and do what they want with it, you know, extensively to provide you better

224
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,640
goods and services that really match what you're looking for, almost try to predict

225
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:55,040
what you're thinking because, you know, when you talk about something, you know, your voice

226
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,540
will be picked up and then all of a sudden you're seeing ads for that thing.

227
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:06,160
This is both from a technology platform that the iPhone and Android are the two predominant

228
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,120
platforms for that system and then in a mobile sense the 4G network is a pipe.

229
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,320
Now, that's allowed the United States since it was the first one to come up with a smartphone

230
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:23,160
and really the second country to build a 4G network to be predominant in the global economy,

231
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:31,520
you know, since really, you know, 2015 or so and those companies continue to extract

232
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,080
data from around the world and create value for those companies and the Chinese really

233
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,240
figured this out and wanted to do the same thing for 5G.

234
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,680
So what you alluded to 5G as a platform, I think this is where people are really confused

235
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,360
about what 5G is.

236
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,680
It's not about providing you a faster cell phone, it's really about allowing you to decouple

237
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,120
yourself from the cell phone, to leave the cell phone behind because it's built into

238
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,120
the world around you.

239
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:08,560
You walk outside, you say Uber and Uber shows up because a camera basically saw you recognize

240
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:15,320
your face using artificial intelligence, read your lips or a microphone picked up your voice,

241
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,520
realize you wanted to Uber and send it to you and then you get in the car and it takes

242
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,780
you on your way.

243
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:25,040
And so all of these services are going to be built into the city around you.

244
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,000
That's the idea behind smart cities.

245
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,760
The challenge for democracy is the challenge that we have with China because as those networks

246
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:39,240
get built and as Baidu and Alibaba and Tencent essentially from behind the great firewall

247
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:45,400
perfect the apps, services and business models of the 5G world and begin to deploy them around

248
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:51,280
the world, then they'll have the ability to really challenge Facebook, Amazon and Netflix

249
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:57,800
and Google in their space and really dominate those and over time what you'll see is strategic

250
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,240
partnerships or mergers happen with those.

251
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,200
And so when that happens, you've got Baidu essentially overtaking Google, essentially

252
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:12,120
Facebook being dominated by Tencent and then you've got Alibaba taking over Amazon.

253
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:20,640
And when you have that, then you have the power to use that data not just to make money

254
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,920
for those companies, but also to collect intelligence and surveillance.

255
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:32,640
So people would listen to this and say, oh, this is just me being alarmist.

256
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,020
But there's a report out of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute by Samantha Hoffman

257
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,000
called Engineering Global Consent.

258
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,560
And that report basically talks about a company called Global Tone Communication Corporation.

259
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:53,200
This is a big data AI company that's in China that collects data to do translation in 65

260
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,200
languages.

261
00:19:54,200 --> 00:20:00,200
They use it for, they use machine learning to essentially translate languages for you

262
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,480
of teleconferences.

263
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,080
That technology is built into some Huawei products.

264
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,900
In any case, they collect two to three petabytes of data per year.

265
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,900
One petabyte is 1000 terabytes.

266
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:18,760
So the interesting thing about Global Tone Communication Corporation is that they're

267
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:26,720
owned collectively by the Ministry of Finance in the PRC in the propaganda arm or the United

268
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,400
Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist Party.

269
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:35,600
So that two to three petabytes of data, in addition to being used to translate language,

270
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,600
go to the intelligence apparatus of the Chinese regime and the influence apparatus of the

271
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,680
Chinese regime.

272
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,680
So this is what's happening with 5G.

273
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:54,440
Because you're decoupled from your smartphone, you no longer have an ability to opt out because

274
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,360
when you could basically say, I'm not going to own a smartphone, therefore people aren't

275
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,600
going to be able to collect data about me.

276
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,940
Now because it's built into the city around you, there's no opting out.

277
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:09,840
It is essentially, what I would expect to see happening is even if Huawei is not building

278
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,960
a network in your town, Baidu is putting up cameras right now so that they can begin to

279
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:22,400
collect information so that they can help make money selling you services like Uber,

280
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,600
creating these virtual button pushes but also begin to know more about you so that if you

281
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:35,680
do at any time decide to have something of relevance to Chinese national interests, then

282
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,840
they'll have some kind of hooks into you.

283
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,200
So I've been asked, what would be the future of a world like this?

284
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,160
And the future is essentially this, that you come home every single day and you teach your

285
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,880
child as they grow what things they can say and what things they can't say to prevent

286
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:57,360
from angering the Chinese Communist Party and bringing financial ruin on the family.

287
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,840
And people say, okay, well that would never happen.

288
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:08,160
And I have friends that have lived here in the US for a long time, five years.

289
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:13,360
Their kids have grown up in the school system and then around the time that they get ready

290
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:19,200
to move back to China, they're having to begin to re-educate their children about what they

291
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,280
can say and what they can't say as they go back into China to prevent exactly what I'm

292
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,680
talking about from happening.

293
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:30,280
So as we're so connected using globalization and the internet-

294
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,080
I'm sorry, don't mind the dogs in the background.

295
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,960
I have two of those too.

296
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,280
One of the things I keep talking about to my audience is that technology is progressing

297
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,720
exponentially while our perception is linear.

298
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,480
So it's not like we can't expect the change.

299
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,280
It's like people don't even remember how things were 20 years ago, before mainstream internet

300
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,560
and smartphones and all that.

301
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,160
And this self-censorship that you're talking about, I imagine it would take only a generation

302
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,400
because it's like the five monkey experiment that you start whatever monkey reaches for

303
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,880
that banana on top of the ladder.

304
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:16,600
It is literally today with Chinese people that live in China, it is subconsciously done.

305
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:23,960
It is so automatic to the way that they live because it just becomes built into the system.

306
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:30,520
And there's an element of once you don't have an access to anything like books or any kind

307
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:35,440
of outside information that gives you any idea that the world could be in any way different,

308
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,000
then it really constrains how you think about the world.

309
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,760
Yeah, I think North Korea is a very good example how this model when it goes extreme, I remember

310
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,760
watching something.

311
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:51,160
Wolf Blitzer was in Pyongyang and in each apartment there was a radio that plays propaganda

312
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,160
24-7.

313
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,960
You can't turn it down, but you can't turn it off.

314
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,480
And I think people here are, they just don't get the intention of the Chinese that is very

315
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,860
hegemonic.

316
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:07,240
They're doing it with a one belt, one road initiative that I'm showing it to our viewers

317
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:12,800
right now that they basically want to build a new Silk Road, but this is not on the basis

318
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,960
of consent by countries who are involved.

319
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,160
They are buying their ports in a way.

320
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,640
They're buying their debts, which can be called, I guess, debt colonization, but they're doing

321
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,760
the very same thing with data.

322
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:31,200
That is a very alien concept to majority of people in the West.

323
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,560
What do you mean by data colonization?

324
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,480
So I just don't know.

325
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,520
As I said, even if the United States manages to decouple from the Chinese, it seems like

326
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,640
we have to rethink our entire alliances because Canada is going the Chinese way, a lot of

327
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,160
European countries are going the Chinese way.

328
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:54,080
So is it going to be that China will be in control of the majority of the world and United

329
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,640
States would be this isolationist literally building the wall and a firewall, the United

330
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:05,880
States will become a new Chinese model that we just block everything, all access to outside

331
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,560
information just to be safe.

332
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,520
Yeah, unfortunately, the mainstream media doesn't really pick up the fact that there's

333
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,240
been a quiet effort at diplomacy throughout the Trump administration.

334
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:26,040
It really started in 2018 where we put a lot of work in 2017 in the strategy in identifying

335
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:30,360
the problem and really refining the message.

336
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:36,440
And then in 2018, the administration began to have bilateral discussions with allies

337
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,720
and partners to say, hey, here's the challenge, we've got to change our system to protect

338
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,720
ourselves.

339
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,480
And so now you're seeing country after country in the EU begin to say, hey, we're not going

340
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,480
to build Huawei.

341
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,080
Now, we've got a long ways to go.

342
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:53,920
But what I can tell you is that I'm fairly confident now that as you look across the

343
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:58,920
European landscape, developed countries, particularly ones that are allies and partners of the United

344
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:04,640
States are choosing not to align themselves with the Chinese in ways that are counter

345
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,400
to what we tell them or that we don't want to see.

346
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:12,080
And so that I think is a good news story.

347
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:19,000
I think the challenge remains for the emerging market world and certainly those other authoritarian

348
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,280
regimes that are going to say very closely tied to China, you're going to see countries

349
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:28,080
in Africa and Latin America and really some of the poor countries in Asia and Central

350
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:34,120
Asia really continue to be on the side of China because they provide them very cheap

351
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,540
things as you alluded to and provides for economic development.

352
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:45,760
That being said, over time, the idea is to focus on growing and strengthening democracies,

353
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,600
their economies, their science and technology, their STEM education, their infrastructure,

354
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,680
their manufacturing base.

355
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,880
So all of that is a long term effort.

356
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,720
We got into this position over three decades with this close relationship with China.

357
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:09,320
It's going to take probably at least a decade for us to begin to create a different alternative

358
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:15,040
so that those other nations that have been kind of blinded by China can look up and see,

359
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,200
okay, that model is not working so great anymore for me.

360
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,960
Maybe I'm going to try this other model.

361
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,140
I mean, this is why we were so successful in the Cold War.

362
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:29,120
We focused on strengthening democracies and promoting them and allowing that system to

363
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,840
be a beacon to those people that didn't live in that space.

364
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:40,240
At the end of the Cold War, we abandoned that and let totalitarians essentially take innovation,

365
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,520
technology, talent and capital, repackage it in their own ideals and re-export it to

366
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,520
the world.

367
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,680
This is something that we just cannot allow to continue.

368
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,480
I think one of the best examples of what you talked about with respect to democracies,

369
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,080
what is happening in Hong Kong that people are waving American flag.

370
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,400
I have an American flag in my room.

371
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:05,520
I had an American flag in Tehran and I smuggled it from Cyprus.

372
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,720
It's not because we loved US government is that it represents certain kind of values

373
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,920
and ideals.

374
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,920
You mentioned Trump and I know that you work with the Trump administration.

375
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:24,440
I'm supporting Trump reelection in 2020 and I know a lot of people who support him, majority

376
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:31,320
of whom care about China and what we are doing with China as the priority of what's happening.

377
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:36,000
Are you confident about Trump to be the best representative for American interest because

378
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,920
I also see Joe Biden who sees that China is not going to eat our lunch, it's not that

379
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:45,960
big of a deal and Michael Bloomberg, it seems like have a lot in common with the Chinese

380
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,960
Communist Party.

381
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:56,920
I think there's a confusion between personalities and politics and national security policy.

382
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,080
I try to stay very focused on national security policy.

383
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:06,240
I try to look at what are the things that the candidates are going to do.

384
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:12,640
I got to say, I saw what Biden did with the Obama administration, I've heard what Bloomberg

385
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,640
did.

386
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:21,640
In the case of Bloomberg, his Bloomberg media did an article on Xi's family and about all

387
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,240
the wealth that they had.

388
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:31,440
So the Bloomberg terminals that represents the majority of his wealth, the Chinese Communist

389
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,600
Party basically turned them off in China and said, don't do it again.

390
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:41,160
Now Bloomberg media self-censors when it comes to reporting on corruption and things within

391
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:45,480
China that have to do with the senior leaders of the Chinese Communist Party.

392
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:54,200
So there is an element of establishment throughout our political system and these establishment

393
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:00,040
politicians have essentially benefited by the system and want to perpetuate the system

394
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:05,680
and that's why they talk about the negativity of tariffs and they talk about not wanting

395
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:14,320
to not invest our retirement funds into Chinese companies that aren't subject to our standards

396
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,160
for audit and transparency.

397
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,840
For me, it is really about who's going to have the policies that actually protect the

398
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:30,320
American people in this different way that the 21st century presents challenges to their

399
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,120
continuing freedoms.

400
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:37,480
That person is Trump or do you see any better?

401
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:44,760
Having seen this, I think the Trump administration, at least today, is best positioned to do that.

402
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:49,760
That being said, I don't know, I can't predict where the election outcome is going to be.

403
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:57,540
I know that on the Democratic side of the House and a lot of established Republicans

404
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:03,080
are leaving politics because I think there's a recognition that there is a change afoot

405
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:08,280
in the United States and I think was brought on by the American people and so both parties

406
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:14,880
I think have to address the challenges clearly, see the Chinese Communist Party for what it

407
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,520
is, see the world for what it is and really figure out new ways to protect the American

408
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:27,400
people and I think whatever candidate does that best will win in 2020.

409
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,480
How do you feel about the current socio-political state in the United States?

410
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,400
Because a lot of people believe that the country has never been more divided and the division

411
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:40,200
is more apparent because of social media, how do you see it?

412
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:52,040
There's a social welfare statistic that measured social satisfaction and I can't remember the

413
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:59,400
name of it but in 2007 when the iPhone came out, US was number one on that and within

414
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:07,840
10 years of that and certainly China's entry into the WTO, now it was number 17.

415
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:14,000
So I think the loss of 70,000 factories, the loss of over 13 million jobs in the United

416
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,320
States when we de-industrialized and really sent all manufacturing work to China and all

417
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:26,520
the support jobs, I think that had a deep scarring impact on our society not to mention

418
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:31,600
that those pension funds and retirement funds or those retirement funds and health benefits

419
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:38,200
that went away added to the national debt in terms of entitlement so there was a knock-on

420
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:45,840
effect from what happened when the US corporations essentially offloaded their manufacturing

421
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:52,560
capacity to China, now they were able to increase their margins so now, for instance, Apple

422
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:59,480
has cash on hand of about $260 billion and they've become a trillion dollar company by

423
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,360
having these enormous margins but if you look at what they did, it was on the basis of slave

424
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:11,880
labor and pollution so they created a country that produces 30% of the carbon in the entire

425
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:19,200
world and really has almost like slave labor conditions in a lot of cases, particularly

426
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:28,640
in the cases of Xinjiang and so what needs to happen is for that to be healed is for

427
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:34,720
those communities within the United States to be made whole and that requires that we

428
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:41,000
actually invest in industrial base in our manufacturing and infrastructure in research

429
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,000
and development that actually drives economic growth and then reshoring the things that

430
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,120
allow you to manufacture.

431
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,960
Something about manufacturing jobs that I wonder about is that beside tax cuts and bringing

432
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,960
jobs back to United States, it's also a matter of automation because unless you're going

433
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:05,240
to nationalize companies or factories, how are you going to force them to hire American

434
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:11,160
workers, for example, rather than just automate? I think Foxconn was a good example in Wisconsin

435
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:16,560
that first they promised to build a plant and then we realized that they've already

436
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,240
invested two plus billion dollars on automating their factories and then Trump called the

437
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:28,040
head of the corporation and that's how it works. So how do you see this moving forward

438
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,860
because that's actually one of the aspects of Trump administration, what he's talking

439
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:36,040
about that long term, I just don't see how it's going to work out when we are entering

440
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,440
the age of automation.

441
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,600
Yeah, so there's actually three good labor studies. There's one by the Upjohn Institute,

442
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:47,840
there's one by David Autor and colleagues at MIT and there's another one by the Economic

443
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:53,240
Policy Institute. All of them take on this question of China entering the WTO. I think

444
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:59,840
they all look at the question of automation, did all these jobs go away from automation?

445
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:06,280
I think the Upjohn Institute did the best job of actually isolating semiconductor manufacture

446
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:12,240
because of Moore's Law that was actually calculated as part of the productivity change. And so

447
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:19,440
when you isolate for that industry alone and you look at the numbers, it's clear that the

448
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:25,120
factory employment that went away was not because of automation, it was because factories

449
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:32,720
moved to China. Now, I've talked to people that saw factories, you know, dismantled brick

450
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:39,360
by brick, particularly a Corning glass factory that had just had maybe 300 million dollars

451
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:46,360
of investment in it. And it was dismantled brick by brick and shipped to China and reassembled

452
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:52,680
and was making glass. So this is what happened. The equipment, the tooling, the facilities,

453
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:58,280
they were all moved to China for manufacturing. So some of those had automation and certainly

454
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,320
were going to have increased automation, but the factories themselves still employed people

455
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:12,440
and they're still going to employ some amount of people. So it's a convenient trope of theoretical

456
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:21,480
economists to uphold this idea of free market economics. Now, free market economics theoretically

457
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:27,480
work. Unfortunately, in practice, what we find is market failure always occurs because

458
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:34,080
there's some company that seeks to dominate that industry or market. And when they do,

459
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:39,000
they start acting monopolistically. Now, there's a good book by Matt Stoller that talks about

460
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,160
the ebb and flow of monopolies versus, you know, the breakup of monopolies with regard

461
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:51,320
to democracies. And so it's really a challenge for democracies today because we've had such

462
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:57,800
consolidation in large corporations and the ownership of businesses have really been stripped

463
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,960
from a lot of small business owners, particularly because of this, because of what China has

464
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,680
done in terms of dominating industries and subsidizing them. Like if you're a factory

465
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:13,800
owner in China, you don't pay for your electrical power that's given to you by the state. You

466
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:20,560
know, all of these subsidies that come to you that really enable you to make a profit,

467
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,600
these are things that the Chinese government do for a specific purpose. That's to create

468
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:30,240
employment so they stay in control. And so for us to get back to where we need to be,

469
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:37,400
the tariffs are so important. Just one part of the mechanism, there's a whole broad array

470
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:43,920
of policy options that need to be brought to bear in order to change and rebalance this

471
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,960
economic differential that we've essentially allowed to occur.

472
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:53,640
Dr. Spalding's book is called Stealth War, How China Took Over While America's Elite

473
00:37:53,640 --> 00:38:01,400
Slept. It came out on October 1st, 2019. What made you write a book at this point and how

474
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,480
the feedback has been so far?

475
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,360
The feedback has been great. It's sold over 10,000 copies now.

476
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,360
Congratulations.

477
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:16,240
Thank you. In just two months. I'm literally getting emails from all over the world. People

478
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:22,640
are reading the book. I just had a Polish language version published. I've had a Chinese

479
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:28,960
language version that's just going to be published and released next month. I think it's really

480
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:35,080
opening people's eyes to what's happened to the world and what we need to do to really

481
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,960
put us back on track to promoting democracy.

482
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,760
I imagine you have to deal with a lot of Chinese Communist Party trolls online as well as a

483
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:47,320
consequence of your stance with respect to China, right?

484
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:53,200
Actually it hasn't been that bad. I think part of the problem is I've been at this for

485
00:38:53,200 --> 00:39:00,040
so long that I've seen all the tricks. It's very hard for them to use the standard arguments.

486
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:04,440
Once they're through the standard arguments, the Communist Party doesn't equip them with

487
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:10,420
anything more. If you don't know how the system works, it's very easy to pull the wool over

488
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:15,600
people's eyes. They have a harder time with me. I think they tend to stay away.

489
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,040
Have you been to China yourself? I'm sure you've been.

490
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:25,160
Yes. I lived there for two years from 2002 to 2004 in Shanghai. Loved it. Loved the people.

491
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:30,440
Loved the language. I learned to speak it out of Defense Language Institute. It was

492
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:35,000
a wonderful time. Quite frankly, at that point, I didn't understand the government or the

493
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:41,600
party. It wasn't until later when I started working on it at the Pentagon. Then in 2016,

494
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:47,360
I went to be the senior defense official in Beijing. I was essentially our country's military

495
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:51,040
representative to China right before I went into the White House.

496
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,880
It seems like everything blew up after Xi Jinping and after Trump. He made it a priority

497
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:02,560
to talk about it. We see more clearly what's happening in Hong Kong and to a lower degree

498
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:09,520
in Taiwan. We don't really know about the opposition to the government inside the mainland

499
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:16,400
China. Xinjiang is one example. What is happening with respect to the rest of the country? You

500
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,840
mentioned very correctly that if you don't get the information, if you don't know what

501
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:25,120
is happening, there is no reason. Then it comes with self-censorship and all that. How

502
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:30,800
do you assess the level of opposition and disagreement to the central government in

503
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,800
the mainland China?

504
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:38,800
There are tens of thousands of protests every year in China. It's usually around some corrupt

505
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:44,400
official, local official that's doing something and really upsetting the people. They're putting

506
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,640
in a power generation factory that's going to create pollution for the local community

507
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:57,140
or somebody is essentially seizing land for some real estate deal that they want to make

508
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:05,680
money on. The country is a totalitarian regime. It's not like Xinjiang everywhere, but certainly

509
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:13,240
the arm of the state is there. It's funny because I remember living in Shanghai. I went

510
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:19,240
to Beijing and I was in this market and I found this air raid siren and it looked really

511
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:23,300
old and so I went and looked at it and I talked to the owner and he said he had bought it

512
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:29,400
from a PLA warehouse, the People's Liberation Army warehouse. He said that they told him

513
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:35,080
that it had been captured from Americans during the Korean War and sure enough it had US stamped

514
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,080
on it.

515
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:42,080
So I bought this thing and I was going to take it home and I had to have it shipped.

516
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:46,560
Before I gave it to the shipping agent, I just wanted to try it out to see what it sounded

517
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:52,480
like. Now, we were in the middle of the market. There's nobody there. I turned this siren

518
00:41:52,480 --> 00:42:02,080
on and it sounded like a loud air raid siren. Within just a matter of one minute, there

519
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:12,120
was literally 50 officers around me. Before that, I hadn't seen any. They were coming

520
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:16,220
to see what was going on and then when they saw what I was doing, they started laughing

521
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:23,320
and all went away. It just gives you an idea of the apparatus that exists in the country

522
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:30,700
that you're not aware of until something brings it out. In fact, you see that. The People's

523
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:37,160
Armed Police and the Ministry of State Security are very large organs within the country and

524
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:44,480
are able to suppress any dissent. Of course, you've got the 50 cent army online that does

525
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,840
a good job of not preventing dissent. What they prevent is collective dissent. If you

526
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:57,640
are a blogger or a poster and you put up things, sometimes they'll let you... If you're complaining

527
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:02,640
about a local official, they'll let you do it, but as soon as two, three, 10 people start

528
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:11,280
to follow you and it really become more of a collective protest, then they shut it down

529
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:18,040
and delete everything. This was actually covered by a Harvard research study that showed that

530
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:23,600
China had become very sophisticated in suppressing collective dissent. There's a lot of things

531
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:29,760
that the apparatus does that are really hidden that you don't see when you live there. Quite

532
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:36,600
frankly, because I was just there not causing any trouble, I never saw it. The first time,

533
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:40,880
it wasn't until later than I really started trying to understand China and the Chinese

534
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:48,040
Communist Party that I began to realize how deep the challenge was.

535
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:54,220
I had to leave Iran as a political dissident and I was human trafficked through a number

536
00:43:54,220 --> 00:44:01,120
of countries including China. This is in 2006. We flew from Kuala Lumpur to Hong Kong, took

537
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:09,480
a bus to the border and then took a cab into Guangzhou and then flew to Shanghai in Canada.

538
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,720
Quite honestly, the way that they're dealing with their surveillance system, with social

539
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:18,200
credit system, all the cameras, facial recognition, all that, I can't even imagine. I had no

540
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:23,040
idea back then about anything that we're talking about with respect to China, but it seems

541
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:28,520
like they have mastered the game of surveillance and they're using it to the best of their

542
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:34,700
advantage. The Western countries are taking notice and they're like, oh, this is working

543
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:40,200
really good for the Chinese government. Is there any kind of a threat of the so-called

544
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:45,880
democratic governments in the West modeling for the sake of security and safety after

545
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,160
the experiments that are being done by the Chinese government?

546
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:56,920
I think right now it's mostly limited to those more authoritarian or emerging market economies,

547
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:03,480
but the capability is incredible. In fact, I had somebody working for me at the embassy

548
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:09,720
that got on one of those Mobikes. The Mobike is a bike that started showing up in Beijing

549
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:16,280
in late 2016 where you could use your phone and scan a QR code. It would unlock the bike.

550
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:22,800
You ride it somewhere and lock it and then it would charge you for however much distance

551
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,960
you use. This guy left his iPad in the basket of the bike and went back to the embassy.

552
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:33,320
He gets to the embassy, realizes he's forgot his iPad, goes in the regional security office,

553
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:37,640
the regional security office calls the public security bureau and they immediately call

554
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:45,920
the guy on the phone that's got the iPad. That's how connected the system is in Beijing

555
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:55,520
now and increasingly throughout all of China. They just went live on 50 cities with 5G networks

556
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:02,880
on 1 November of this year. That penetration of technology and surveillance system, both

557
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:08,360
from because everybody uses a smartphone and are in the apps and China has access to that

558
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:14,340
data plus the cameras with facial recognition, you really have this ability to monitor quite

559
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:20,420
closely the population and incentivize them to do things that the Chinese Communist Party

560
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:22,480
thinks make you a good citizen.

561
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,920
Because of the firewall, the apps are very limited too. I think there are only two or

562
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:31,540
three of them that people do everything with them basically from ordering food to go to

563
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:35,480
chatting. Is that correct?

564
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:42,520
The WeChat app can almost be considered a platform much like the iOS is a platform for

565
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:49,800
the iPhone. You open the WeChat app and then once you open the WeChat app, you have all

566
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:56,720
of these other apps that you can use to order airline tickets or order food or pay for things.

567
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:02,520
It really is an incredible suite of tools. Of course, all of that data is collected by

568
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:07,360
WeChat and then the Chinese Communist Party has access to it.

569
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:12,600
That's part of the constitution that if the Chinese Communist Party asks for data or anything

570
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:17,920
that the company has or a Western company that works within China, if they ask for information,

571
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:18,920
they have to hand it over.

572
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,280
They have to have it, yes.

573
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:26,360
Yeah. I don't know what to say. It's kind of dystopian but it is what it is I guess.

574
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:31,600
What can we learn from the Chinese because it's completely unfair to say that they haven't

575
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,920
had the success. They had the model. They had the objective that they wanted to reach

576
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,400
and they seem to be very successful at it.

577
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:43,320
No. I think during the Cold War, particularly in the Eisenhower administration, the United

578
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:47,360
States invested in infrastructure so we built things like the Eisenhower National Highway

579
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:54,560
System. We invested in technology, R&D, research and development, basic science research. We

580
00:47:54,560 --> 00:48:02,440
invested in science, technology, engineering and math education. We created a lot of scientists

581
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:07,920
particularly during the space race and then we invested in our manufacturing base. We

582
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:18,000
had huge manufacturing areas like in Detroit. China for the last 30 years has been investing

583
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,200
in their economy and in their people so that's one thing that I would say is quite laudable.

584
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:29,760
We are today $5 trillion in arrears in infrastructure investment in the United States. We haven't

585
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:37,080
been spending on, we were spending 2% of gross domestic product in the 60s in basic science

586
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:43,600
research. Today it's less than 0.7% and most of that is going to the National Institute

587
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:49,480
of Health and most of that, if not all of it, is also going to China on STEM education.

588
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:54,640
We don't fund STEM education anymore. Most of the students now in STEM educational billets

589
00:48:54,640 --> 00:49:00,800
within the US universities are from China and then finally on manufacturing we've lost

590
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:07,160
so many factories we can't manufacture things anymore and so we can begin to invest in our

591
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:14,240
country and in our people. I think that's one. In terms of development of emerging market

592
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:18,560
economies in ways that both connect them to the global economy but also provide for their

593
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:26,040
population, if you look at our organizations like USAID, they'll get money that the Congress

594
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:32,320
gives them to say do a water project in Ethiopia. It's not tied to any other thing and so these

595
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:39,600
developmental projects from Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the TDA, XM Bank,

596
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:45,800
USAID, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, none of these are focused on what I would

597
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:50,880
call strategic investment for geopolitical reasons. So you're not just promoting the

598
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:55,720
economies and the societies, you're also promoting the principles and the institutions

599
00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:00,840
of those same countries in ways that allow them to grow strong economically and prosperous

600
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:07,440
but also begin to have the kind of rule of law and civil liberties that we want to promote.

601
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:14,160
We could do a much better job of coordinating that activity but these are the things that

602
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,960
we're going to have to learn from the Chinese in terms of development. They actually, they'll

603
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,720
look at a country and they'll say hey, I need a raw material out of this country. I want

604
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:28,560
to connect it to China so they can use it to manufacture. At the same time, I want to

605
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:35,400
be able to sell to these people. So let's create the mine, the port, the rail, the roads,

606
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:40,420
the telecommunications links, the water, the power. Once we have that, let's bring in low

607
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:45,360
value added manufacturing, shoes, textiles. Let's put them to work. Okay, now we have

608
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:51,080
that. Let's give them housing. Okay, now we have that. Let's start to sell them $50 smartphones.

609
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:56,480
Let's get them WeChat. Let's get them some electronic payments. Let's get the government

610
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,840
some cameras so they can start watching the population, make sure that they can round

611
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:05,520
up their troublemakers. We'll show them how to do all that. And now you've got a built-in

612
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:11,720
kind of IT-based authoritarian society that's fully plugged into China and can be part of

613
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:17,160
its ecosystem. This is, and oh, by the way, in doing all that, they've moved a lot of

614
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:25,120
their population of excess males in China into that country. They did the original construction.

615
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:29,400
They do manufacturing. They start businesses to the tunes of tens of thousands of people

616
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:36,280
that come from China into these countries. And then you create this outside force that

617
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:41,320
actually is very supportive of the regime because they're economically and financially

618
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:47,440
tied into it. So, I mean, it's a really good, smart model on the terms of what they've done.

619
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,840
I call it building, not breaking. You know, the chief export of the United States has

620
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:56,920
been breaking things using war in the last two decades. I think in the next two decades,

621
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:01,720
we can say we've been builders and not breakers. I think we're going to be successful in kind

622
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,480
of countering the rise of totalitarianism in our world.

623
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:09,960
That's an excellent message. A lot of our audience are from Canada. Do you have any

624
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:15,960
thoughts with respect to the relationship between Canada and China, especially how Canada

625
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:21,640
has detained the daughter of the CEO of Huawei and two Canadians are still taking basically

626
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:25,400
hostages, political hostages in China? Do you have any thoughts on that?

627
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:30,440
Yeah. So, I mean, I think it's about rule of law versus rule by law. I think Meng Wanzhou

628
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:40,040
clearly has been indicted for bank fraud. There's a lot of, I mean, ZTE, for instance,

629
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:44,400
does it directly. I mean, they were sending fraud payments directly from the headquarters.

630
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:50,680
I think they were doing this in order to support the Iranian regime, you know, by selling them

631
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:58,360
goods. This is indisputable. The evidence is clear. It wasn't done to have trade leverage.

632
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:04,040
It was done because she broke the law. And quite frankly, Huawei and many other companies

633
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:11,560
continue to do things that violate rules and norms. In terms of the Canadian individuals

634
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:16,840
that are detained, it's not clear that they did anything. In fact, we know that China

635
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:22,360
does extrajudicial detainment all the time for the purposes of whatever they want to do.

636
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:26,440
You know, you say you're the head of a, you're the billion dollar head of a company.

637
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:32,040
You angered the Communist Party. Guess what? You're going to go away for a while.

638
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:37,720
You may be even permanently. You know, this is the way China works. There is no due process.

639
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:45,480
There is no, you know, right to see an attorney or have any kind of justice's blind scenario.

640
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:50,920
It is the Communist Party is the law. And that's they make the decision what's going to happen to

641
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:56,920
you. And so, you know, I think, you know, from Canada's standpoint, I mean, there's only one

642
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:01,880
choice. It's really is, you know, promoting and supporting the rule of law, civil liberties,

643
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:07,880
human rights, democratic principles, free trade, the things that we try to instantiate in international

644
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:14,280
order after World War Two. And that's what the United States is trying to do. And despite

645
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:19,640
all of this noise that says we're trying to be isolationist. No, we're trying to not destroy

646
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:25,400
the international system. We're trying to in some ways rebuild it. So it begins to be, you know,

647
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:30,280
the Human Rights Council can be the Human Rights Council and not the Human Wrongs Council. That's

648
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:34,920
going to take a lot of work. And we're going to have to work with allies and partners. Like I said,

649
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:39,800
our diplomats have been talking to them. And I think if you would, if you look at the bureaucratic

650
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:46,040
level of a lot of these countries, governments, you know, that are especially democracies, they've

651
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:50,840
heard this message from the United States quite clearly. And they're trying to figure out how they

652
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:54,520
implement, you know, the same kind of protections in their own societies.

653
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:59,160
Yeah, the Human Rights Council that is led by Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, it's a bit of a head

654
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:05,560
scratcher. Very much so. Dr. Spalding's book is called Stealth War, How China Took Over While

655
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:11,320
America's Elite Slept. What is next for you? And where can our audience follow your future works?

656
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:17,480
So I'm 2020. I'm just going to be talking about the challenge of totalitarianism, the rise of

657
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:26,520
totalitarianism in the world. I just got back from Poland and Lithuania and the UK. I'm going to

658
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:30,680
different countries and throughout the United States to talk about this using the book as a

659
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:35,960
platform to start a dialogue. Let's have a conversation. You may not agree with everything

660
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:43,080
that the United States stands for. And you may have some grievances because of some of the things

661
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:47,160
that we've done in foreign policy. You may continue to have those grievances. But that doesn't

662
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:53,160
preclude us from having a logical, you know, fact-based conversation about how we protect

663
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:59,320
democracy in a globalized internet-powered world where, you know, our data is easily taken and used

664
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:04,840
for things that we don't want it to be. I imagine that your book has created a lot of attention and

665
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:10,280
traction in Japan as well. Is that right? Because Japanese seem to be on the forefront of the Chinese

666
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:20,200
conflict. Yes, Japan, Australia, you know, countries like this, you know, in Europe,

667
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:25,720
from the Baltic to the Mediterranean, most of those countries that were under the boot of the

668
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:32,360
Soviet Union really are responding to the message. So I think it's, you know, my belief is we're on a

669
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:38,600
good trajectory. We have to just keep working. We have to keep focusing on the challenges that

670
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:43,640
we face and work on them together. Excellent. Let me ask you the last question I ask all my guests,

671
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:48,280
that if you come across an intelligent alien from a different civilization, what would you say is

672
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:52,120
the worst thing humanity has done? And what would you say is our greatest achievement?

673
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:59,160
The worst thing that we've done is probably what's going on, some of the stuff that's going on in

674
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:05,560
China right now, putting people in concentration camps and organ harvesting, I think, is absolutely

675
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:12,760
horrendous. That being said, I think, you know, there are acts of kindness in our world every

676
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:19,160
single day. And if we choose to see the good in people, then we're not going to be able to

677
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:26,680
do that. If we choose to see the good in people, then, you know, that is where true humanity,

678
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:54,120
humanity lies.
