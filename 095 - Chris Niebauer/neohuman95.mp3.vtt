WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.360
I guess that's why I'm hopeful about this. I think we're gonna find the importance of

00:05.360 --> 00:09.140
– I just like the way you put that. I think we're gonna find the importance of having

00:09.140 --> 00:14.600
a voluntary tribe to be able to pick and choose what tribes we are. And that really satisfies

00:14.600 --> 00:20.640
the old program. It gives it something to do. It satisfies its needs. But it doesn't

00:20.640 --> 00:26.840
create, you know, the massive collective of one single tribe that's, you know, kind of,

00:26.840 --> 00:34.720
like I said, steamrolling over everyone else. And that's the real tragedy of the 20th century

00:34.720 --> 00:41.120
was that that one tribe got so big and then it got so massive and it was capable of inflicting

00:41.120 --> 00:53.400
so much damage that we don't want to have any one tribe get that big again.

00:53.400 --> 00:57.960
Chris Nebar, welcome back to the New Human Podcast, this time the 95th episode.

00:57.960 --> 01:04.440
Hey, so great to be here. First, let me start off. Thank you so much for copying the book.

01:04.440 --> 01:05.440
Yeah, absolutely.

01:05.440 --> 01:12.840
It's really awesome. You really need to have in paperback. It feels good. The art is amazing.

01:12.840 --> 01:17.120
So this is such a – so cool to be part of that. I really enjoyed it.

01:17.120 --> 01:24.040
Yeah, Chris was nice enough to write a foreword for my first book, which is a poetry book.

01:24.040 --> 01:32.200
And I also work with a great Japanese artist, Takamoto Mamiko. So yeah, I appreciate you

01:32.200 --> 01:38.800
promoting the book. Let me promote your book, Chris Nebar's book that basically brought

01:38.800 --> 01:43.880
us together, No Self, No Problem, How Neuro-Psychology is Catching Up to Buddhism. And I remember

01:43.880 --> 01:48.840
you were saying that you're working also on a new book, right?

01:48.840 --> 01:53.400
It's a collection of exercises, because one of the things in the first book people realize

01:53.400 --> 01:58.640
is like, you can't think your way out of a thinking problem. So I don't want to just

01:58.640 --> 02:03.760
take a bunch of thoughts and philosophy and expect that to really transform people. So

02:03.760 --> 02:08.920
we switch things around. It's just exercise after exercise. Some of them seem silly almost

02:08.920 --> 02:14.600
to the thinking mind, but they're all trying to get us out of – I don't say get us out

02:14.600 --> 02:19.040
of thinking mind, but put the thinking mind in its proper place. It's a useful tool.

02:19.040 --> 02:23.880
We wouldn't want to get rid of it. It helps me remember where I left my keys. It helps

02:23.880 --> 02:30.280
me solve problems. But you probably only need it maybe a couple hours a day at best. And

02:30.280 --> 02:33.620
the problem is most people, they don't have an off switch. So they're sleeping – trying

02:33.620 --> 02:37.760
to get to sleep. And unfortunately, that program is still going.

02:37.760 --> 02:41.960
And so this one – so not only does it focus on the exercises, but it takes us a little

02:41.960 --> 02:49.400
further back. What was the origins of mind? Did it just turn on 200 years ago? And I started

02:49.400 --> 02:55.040
doing some really deep work in anthropology and discovered some very fascinating things

02:55.040 --> 03:00.280
about our species. And so it takes us all the way back 200 – 2 million years ago when

03:00.280 --> 03:05.440
human beings showed up on the scene. And then it takes us through when Homo sapiens showed

03:05.440 --> 03:11.280
up. And a lot of the theory is around what happened to us as Homo sapiens. So a lot of

03:11.280 --> 03:17.240
us don't realize that there were eight different types of humans on the planet. And that was

03:17.240 --> 03:23.040
really just up until like Homo erectus was on the planet for 2 million years. Homo sapiens,

03:23.040 --> 03:28.460
we just came along like 200,000 years ago. So we just got here. And then this wild thing

03:28.460 --> 03:34.320
happened where we just dominated, completely took over the whole planet, exterminated possibly

03:34.320 --> 03:37.680
except there's other theories. But we may have just terminated all the different forms

03:37.680 --> 03:45.640
of humanity. And now we're left. And so the theory tries to suggest that the reason

03:45.640 --> 03:51.120
we were so successful is because the way the mind works. And the mind was good at strategizing,

03:51.120 --> 03:56.200
it's good at categorization, some of the stuff I'm sure we'll talk about today.

03:56.200 --> 04:00.880
But those were all super advantages in terms of our species. These other – the Homo erectus

04:00.880 --> 04:05.160
may have been able to think and reason a little bit, but they didn't have the tools that

04:05.160 --> 04:09.840
we had in terms of creating groups, in-group and out-groups. And so even though we were

04:09.840 --> 04:16.560
physically smaller, you know, let's say than Neanderthal, but it didn't matter because

04:16.560 --> 04:20.600
if you get 10 of us working together as a group, we'll still be able to take out that

04:20.600 --> 04:28.200
one much larger individual. And so it tries to give people a backstory on this thinking

04:28.200 --> 04:35.080
point. Where did it come from? Why is it so hard to turn off, you know? And it's trying

04:35.080 --> 04:40.360
to solve problems like – it's trying to solve problems that we had 100,000 years ago.

04:40.360 --> 04:47.560
So it's dealing with, you know, glaciers and food supply and, you know, extreme changes

04:47.560 --> 04:52.120
in temperature. And now all of a sudden we're in a place like – we created a world that

04:52.120 --> 04:55.960
has almost no temperature change at all with air conditioning and heat. Most of us, many

04:55.960 --> 05:03.240
of us, live between like, you know, 68 and 72 degrees or something. And so what does

05:03.240 --> 05:09.760
the mind have to do? You know, what does it have to do? And so what it does is it still

05:09.760 --> 05:15.080
finds its meaning in finding problems. So it is out there when it can't find a problem,

05:15.080 --> 05:20.040
it creates one. In fact, I'll send you another link. It's maybe one of the most important

05:20.040 --> 05:24.680
papers. I don't know if you've seen it or maybe we've talked about it, but it demonstrated

05:24.680 --> 05:30.520
this so beautifully, experimentally, that the mind is just creating problems. And it

05:30.520 --> 05:37.160
will redefine what a problem is if its first problem changes or say you solve the first

05:37.160 --> 05:41.560
problem. It will redefine the problem so it continuously has something to do. And so they

05:41.560 --> 05:46.800
gave subjects a task. Just hit a key every time a blue dot comes up. And it was blue

05:46.800 --> 05:52.740
dots and they would go all the way from blue to purple. And eventually they just stopped

05:52.740 --> 05:56.320
showing blue dots. And you'd think, well, the subject should just stop responding. You

05:56.320 --> 06:00.800
know, here's my target. It's not there anymore. I stopped responding. But they didn't. They

06:00.800 --> 06:05.920
changed the definition of blue. So they started responding to purple dots. And that's kind

06:05.920 --> 06:10.320
of cool. But the next two studies, really, it's worth just giving you a short description

06:10.320 --> 06:16.520
of because it's going to be relevant to, I think, our whole discussion. But in another

06:16.520 --> 06:23.560
study, what they had is bright faces that look threatening. So they're a really threatening

06:23.560 --> 06:28.200
face. But then it really went all the way to like a neutral or maybe completely non-threatening

06:28.200 --> 06:32.440
face. But the first task was hit a key every time you see a threatening, this particular

06:32.440 --> 06:36.360
threatening face. And then just like before, they stopped showing threatening faces. And

06:36.360 --> 06:40.560
again, people didn't stop responding. They just changed what a threatening face is. So

06:40.560 --> 06:46.280
suddenly this face that's neutral, now they think that that's a threat. And the last one,

06:46.280 --> 06:51.500
I think, again, maybe that was the most relevant one to some of the stuff we're dealing with.

06:51.500 --> 06:56.880
They said, pick, so you're going to be a researcher and you're evaluating the ethics on this research

06:56.880 --> 07:01.680
proposal. And they would throw in huge ethical flaws. And your task is to catch the ethical

07:01.680 --> 07:05.720
flaw. And so, of course, everyone was pretty good at this. Then they removed the ethical

07:05.720 --> 07:10.640
flaws. And again, instead of not responding anymore, like, hey, problem solved, people

07:10.640 --> 07:16.520
changed the definition of what an ethical problem is. And they would continuously.

07:16.520 --> 07:21.920
And here's the most beautiful part about this study. They went and told people, like, look,

07:21.920 --> 07:27.600
we're going to stop the problem. We're going to stop showing you the target. Had no effect.

07:27.600 --> 07:32.880
Then they paid people to be correct. So you think, look, I'm going to get paid if I'm

07:32.880 --> 07:40.120
just accurate. Had no effect on performance. It's so set on redefining what a problem is

07:40.120 --> 07:44.560
that and I think that's one of the things we're dealing with right now.

07:44.560 --> 07:50.560
So many of our problems that our mind, the thinking mind evolved to solve, they're gone.

07:50.560 --> 07:55.760
So now we find, like, oh, it's, you know, 68 degrees, I'm freezing. And that becomes

07:55.760 --> 08:02.280
a problem. Or it's 74 or 75 and I'm, you know, too hot. And so all these things they're

08:02.280 --> 08:06.720
dealing with in society, these amazing complaints that were just like, where did that stuff

08:06.720 --> 08:11.800
come from? So many things in office politics. I mean, so much of the conflict that's going

08:11.800 --> 08:16.840
on right now, you could almost say, how much of the conflict going on is just people finding

08:16.840 --> 08:22.320
problems? Because that seems to be what the mind does. And it does. And it does so even

08:22.320 --> 08:25.000
when there isn't a problem to be solved.

08:25.000 --> 08:35.800
So this mentality of oppressed versus the oppressor that Marxism kind of capitalized

08:35.800 --> 08:41.120
on it, you know, by not creating it maybe, but by recognizing that this is something

08:41.120 --> 08:47.280
that is deeply embedded within humanity. And now it's been incentivized that, you know,

08:47.280 --> 08:51.680
now it's changing a little bit because I think people have begun seeing right through it.

08:51.680 --> 08:59.960
But for a long time, it was incentivized that if you're a victim, you're the special one.

08:59.960 --> 09:06.480
And so, for example, let's say within this context of critical race theory that we're

09:06.480 --> 09:13.480
going to talk about, all it is, is that if you're white, you are taking advantage of

09:13.480 --> 09:18.600
this privilege that has been given to you by other white people who, by the way, screwed

09:18.600 --> 09:23.800
over everyone else for you as a white person to have this privilege. So if you're born

09:23.800 --> 09:32.280
white, not only you cannot not be an oppressor, you can't also recognize that, yes, I could

09:32.280 --> 09:36.880
have some privileges, but I don't really see races. I see just different people with...

09:36.880 --> 09:42.120
No, no, no, no, no, you can't be doing that either. You have to be actively anti-racist.

09:42.120 --> 09:46.360
And they define what is anti-racism, which includes, you know, you buying books, a bunch

09:46.360 --> 09:53.760
of people who are getting paid like $20,000, $25,000 an hour just to give Zoom talks, just

09:53.760 --> 09:59.440
so people feel like, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, we're on the part of the oppressed.

09:59.440 --> 10:00.440
So...

10:00.440 --> 10:05.720
It's a beautiful Freudian trick. Freud did the same thing. He said, look, you know, you

10:05.720 --> 10:09.400
hate your parents and it's unconscious. And one or two things happened. You know, you'd

10:09.400 --> 10:13.120
either agree with them, say, you're right, I hate my parents, or you wouldn't. And then

10:13.120 --> 10:17.840
he's still right because it's just unconscious. And there's no way the person can win. So

10:17.840 --> 10:23.040
anything you do, it's like it philosophically puts you into a corner where you can't win.

10:23.040 --> 10:29.440
So you either admit that you're the oppressor or by definition, you're like, you don't see

10:29.440 --> 10:30.440
it as a problem.

10:30.440 --> 10:34.720
Well, you don't see it that you're an oppressor, but you're still an oppressor. Yeah.

10:34.720 --> 10:40.720
Yeah. And it's impossible. There's literally nothing. So there's... And again, maybe this

10:40.720 --> 10:45.800
has been one of the hallmarks of history. We put people into certain categories based

10:45.800 --> 10:51.200
on physical characteristics and we back them into these corners where there's really nothing

10:51.200 --> 10:57.360
they can do, you know, except admit that this group is right. I mean, it ends up being their

10:57.360 --> 10:58.360
only choice.

10:58.360 --> 11:04.320
Yeah. But obviously it's bogus in the context of, for example, critical race theory, because

11:04.320 --> 11:12.160
what it is is that it's a form of racism that justifies itself because it's fighting a different

11:12.160 --> 11:16.660
kind of racism. But they're saying that this is actually not racism to be racist against

11:16.660 --> 11:20.360
white people because white people have been in power for a very long time. So it's okay

11:20.360 --> 11:25.440
if they get screwed over for the sake of other people. But you see that even that, they're

11:25.440 --> 11:30.560
not staying true to that because for... Kanye West came out to support Trump. Everybody

11:30.560 --> 11:36.040
came down at him that, oh, he's white supremacist. He's a wrong kind of black. There are plenty

11:36.040 --> 11:40.480
of black people who are on the right, who are not going along with what's going on.

11:40.480 --> 11:46.600
A very good example of what happened yesterday in Virginia that, you know, a bunch of people

11:46.600 --> 11:51.280
on MSNBC and CNN were talking about, oh, this is a result of racism that people have voted

11:51.280 --> 11:57.360
for this conservative for the Republican Party by margin of a lot, you know, because Biden

11:57.360 --> 12:03.880
won Virginia by I think around 10 points. And this shift has been enormous. But they're

12:03.880 --> 12:10.200
not even mentioning that Virginia also elected their first black female lieutenant governor.

12:10.200 --> 12:17.400
And how is this going to be aligned with this idea that they're promoting that no, all the

12:17.400 --> 12:20.960
white people are against all the black people and all the black people are basically the

12:20.960 --> 12:29.360
oppressed who have absolutely no ability to do anything other than just being in this

12:29.360 --> 12:36.360
line that we're drawing with the leadership of absolute minority of people, most of whom

12:36.360 --> 12:44.000
are coming from academia, right? All this academic theory that they've forced upon people

12:44.000 --> 12:48.720
as some kind of social experiments that they're saying, hey, just believe what we are saying.

12:48.720 --> 12:53.400
This is a new form of religion. Just believe in the greater good, the good end, the utopia

12:53.400 --> 13:00.040
that we are drawing. And, you know, everything, everything else basically justifies this end.

13:00.040 --> 13:06.880
And there's a couple things going on there. I think cognitive science offers actually

13:06.880 --> 13:14.260
some help in this area because we know confirmation bias is probably one of the biggest faults

13:14.260 --> 13:19.240
of the way we think. You know, we set out to prove we're right. And, of course, that's

13:19.240 --> 13:22.560
what Freud did. And if you're really good at proving you're right, that's when you're

13:22.560 --> 13:27.600
clever enough to back people into a corner and they can't do anything. And so, again,

13:27.600 --> 13:31.040
when you just think about, like, what do you type? What are you typing? What are you looking

13:31.040 --> 13:34.760
at? And, of course, there's algorithms that if you're only looking to confirm what you

13:34.760 --> 13:39.320
already know, then a computer is going to help you so much with that. All these search

13:39.320 --> 13:42.360
engines are going to look, they're going to so support this because then you're just going

13:42.360 --> 13:46.420
to find more and more evidence of exactly what you know. And, of course, if that's happening

13:46.420 --> 13:50.880
with the media, that's a problem too. But we also have really smart people like Steven

13:50.880 --> 13:54.980
Pinker goes around. I mean, he wrote that book Enlightenment Now to show that we really

13:54.980 --> 13:59.760
have it amazingly good right now. But I also love one of his other lines that almost seemed

13:59.760 --> 14:04.560
like it took me back to third grade, but we need a reminder of it. And he said, you cannot

14:04.560 --> 14:09.880
make accurate judgments about the individual based on their group membership. And it's

14:09.880 --> 14:17.240
like, well, yeah, I know that. But we all seem like we should know that. But somehow

14:17.240 --> 14:23.980
we threw that philosophy, we threw that piece of advice, or I would say that piece of fact,

14:23.980 --> 14:28.480
we just threw it out the window. And now we're back to saying, if I know your group membership,

14:28.480 --> 14:33.680
I know something about you. But the problem is, we know from research and statistics,

14:33.680 --> 14:36.840
I mean, no, you cannot make, I mean, that's the whole thing about when you look at the

14:36.840 --> 14:42.080
normal curve, it shows that here's a bunch of average people. But, you know, half of

14:42.080 --> 14:47.300
them will be on the right, nor they're on the other. This is the abstract way of describing

14:47.300 --> 14:52.520
a group. And there's tons of variability within that group. And what we're finding out, I

14:52.520 --> 14:56.240
think, one of the major lessons that we will eventually find out, although I think maybe

14:56.240 --> 15:01.160
Jordan Peterson may have said this too, already, that what we're going to find out is that

15:01.160 --> 15:06.760
there's far more variability within these groups than there are between them. And so

15:06.760 --> 15:11.320
simply by categorizing people white and black, well, what if there's more variability within

15:11.320 --> 15:15.760
each of those groups? Then it makes absolutely no sense to use the categorical division in

15:15.760 --> 15:21.440
the first place. And we need to move on to something that, unfortunately, is more complex.

15:21.440 --> 15:26.840
The thinking mind does not want to work. It's lazy. It loves cartoon-like versions of reality

15:26.840 --> 15:34.160
that are just easy to assimilate. And so when we tell people things like, you know, well,

15:34.160 --> 15:37.600
here's group A and group B, and they have these different characteristics. Oh, you know,

15:37.600 --> 15:42.320
someone from group B? Well, then this is one thing you can conclude about them. I mean,

15:42.320 --> 15:47.760
it's really a cartoon-like version of reality, but the mind buys into it because it loves

15:47.760 --> 15:55.640
simple stories like that, simple narratives. And we become victims of, like, just falling

15:55.640 --> 16:02.920
prey to really simple stories that the mind is very, I mean, that's the way it worked.

16:02.920 --> 16:11.440
I mean, back, so the theory that I've been working on is, again, a story about our history

16:11.440 --> 16:16.240
as a species and how is it that human beings came on the planet about two and a half million

16:16.240 --> 16:20.800
years ago, and then all of a sudden we had all kinds of different, you know, Homo erectus,

16:20.800 --> 16:23.960
Nandrothal, and we had all these different, maybe eight, although they probably end up

16:23.960 --> 16:28.320
going to get to, like, 12. Who knows how many? They keep finding different versions when they

16:28.320 --> 16:29.320
find artifacts.

16:29.320 --> 16:30.320
Of humans.

16:30.320 --> 16:38.160
And these are human beings. These are human beings. But we have slight differences. And

16:38.160 --> 16:42.760
again, Homo sapiens, our version, popped up on the scene only 200,000 years ago, and we

16:42.760 --> 16:49.040
were smaller, we were not physically dominant, but we had this gift, this kind of mental

16:49.040 --> 16:55.720
trick, this kind of mind hack of categorizing. And it's not that other species couldn't

16:55.720 --> 17:00.560
do this, but I think we just did it so effortlessly. It just came so easy. And one of the things

17:00.560 --> 17:06.000
that I think we're going to realize is that categorization is absolutely an illusion.

17:06.000 --> 17:12.480
It's the same, like, when people ask me, look, what do you mean by Maya? You know, this illusory

17:12.480 --> 17:20.040
male that prevents us from seeing the real world. And the thing I would point to is categorization.

17:20.040 --> 17:24.240
And categorization, again, well, what do we do with categorization? We take a bunch of

17:24.240 --> 17:29.160
individual differences, tons of variability. That's the way nature is. It's all messy.

17:29.160 --> 17:33.560
And then the mind will focus on one quality that all these very different things have

17:33.560 --> 17:39.240
in common, ignores everything else, ignores all the differences, the vast differences

17:39.240 --> 17:44.260
in all these individuals. And so we could say, like, that's ignorance. It's like ignorance.

17:44.260 --> 17:47.760
You just have to completely ignore all that. But they say, well, they all have this one

17:47.760 --> 17:55.660
thing in common. And again, whether it's skin color, gender, that's whatever, identity politics.

17:55.660 --> 18:00.400
You're taking people who have one thing in common and you're grouping them and then believing

18:00.400 --> 18:08.560
that it's possible to know that group. And you can't. I mean, there are a bunch of individuals

18:08.560 --> 18:13.920
who vary all over the place. It's super. And what it is, these averages that we talk about

18:13.920 --> 18:18.240
when we look at groups, they're statistical averages that are just, they exist in the

18:18.240 --> 18:24.520
world of abstractions. They're not, you can't go out and see these groups. Like, you might

18:24.520 --> 18:29.280
be saying, well, I can see an example of a white person. Well, can you really see whiteness?

18:29.280 --> 18:37.360
Can you see, you know, the race? And you can't. You can't because it's something that we've

18:37.360 --> 18:44.880
made up. And I think we're going to eventually start feeling that a little bit more deep.

18:44.880 --> 18:51.520
And you can see that some of the political stuff we're dealing with here is an argument

18:51.520 --> 18:58.240
between group identities. And I think identity politics is exactly that. It's simplifying

18:58.240 --> 19:04.440
people based on very trivial characteristics and, you know, race and gender. The irony

19:04.440 --> 19:09.480
of this is when you get into spiritual practices, like a lot of different forms of meditation,

19:09.480 --> 19:15.200
you start the meditation off saying, I'm not my body. I mean, you're starting off like

19:15.200 --> 19:24.160
with this acknowledgement, like my true self has nothing to do with this physical body.

19:24.160 --> 19:30.160
And yet we seem to take some of these really trivial qualities and we categorize them and

19:30.160 --> 19:33.280
then believe we can know something about a person based on that.

19:33.280 --> 19:39.360
Yeah, but, you know, even the term we, when you say we, there is no such a thing as we.

19:39.360 --> 19:44.720
No, there isn't. It's all useful, somewhat useful abstractions, but I think they are

19:44.720 --> 19:47.160
getting us into trouble more than they should. You're right.

19:47.160 --> 19:52.240
Yeah, we all use it. You know, again, see, I'm saying we all use it. I'm sure there's

19:52.240 --> 20:00.440
some people who don't use it, but it also shows the limits of language and how limited

20:00.440 --> 20:09.920
everything man-made is towards that objective reality. And I think this is a very important

20:09.920 --> 20:16.320
difference to understand that yes, the conflict of humanity seemed to have been around this

20:16.320 --> 20:23.760
dilemma of individuality and group, tribes basically. And for a longest time, it obviously

20:23.760 --> 20:27.960
made sense for people to be in groups because there were other groups of people. And if

20:27.960 --> 20:31.520
you were not in a group, you would be just decimated. You would be annihilated by that

20:31.520 --> 20:38.280
group of people. But we became more secure in the case of our survival. You know, we

20:38.280 --> 20:45.840
are not bound to go and find any kind of a food today because there might not be food

20:45.840 --> 20:51.760
for the next five days, right? So we have the option to go to different grocery stores

20:51.760 --> 20:59.520
to find different items up to our likings, which is customized. So let's say that shopper

20:59.520 --> 21:04.120
be placed in a group. Yes, it can be placed in a group of shoppers, people who go out

21:04.120 --> 21:09.160
and shop. But you cannot pin it down that there's a group of people who go, you know,

21:09.160 --> 21:15.160
this percentage to like Publix, this percentage to Walgreens, this percentage to Walmart.

21:15.160 --> 21:22.120
People have this freedom and autonomy to make different choices, right? But it seems like

21:22.120 --> 21:31.080
because this structure called society is also manmade, this is not an objective reality.

21:31.080 --> 21:39.200
We have assembled this construct and all the tools within it, including ethics and morality

21:39.200 --> 21:46.120
to get from point A to point B. And that point B has always been determined based on the

21:46.120 --> 21:51.260
need that we've had in order to survive. I don't think people have come together most

21:51.260 --> 21:58.080
in most of history to build something necessarily. They've come together to build something against

21:58.080 --> 22:03.340
something or someone else. There's always been a threat for people to come together

22:03.340 --> 22:08.620
and build like a, you know, I would argue it's always been about tools. You just build

22:08.620 --> 22:14.440
a more capable, more complex, more sophisticated tool, own the other group, and then the other

22:14.440 --> 22:19.480
group, whatever remains of it, notice what you've done, improve upon that tool. And,

22:19.480 --> 22:26.720
you know, we have evolved in the way that our tools have surpassed our level of comprehension.

22:26.720 --> 22:34.440
And now we are, you know, we are really addressing the core of exactly what is it that when we

22:34.440 --> 22:43.880
say we, what do we mean? What are the elements that we have in, you know, we share as a collective

22:43.880 --> 22:49.600
of humanity? And I think this is that point, which is the point of philosophy, really.

22:49.600 --> 22:55.920
Yeah, I think we talked about the beginning of that movie, 2001, A Space Odyssey, where,

22:55.920 --> 23:00.360
you know, that moment, that first thought, and one of our ancestors like, well, this

23:00.360 --> 23:05.040
is a bone, but I can use it as a weapon. So we started thinking in ways that we could

23:05.040 --> 23:09.600
use things for what they're not. And then he throws that bone into space, and it becomes,

23:09.600 --> 23:14.880
you know, a space shuttle or something. And you're like, wow, you know, it's the same,

23:14.880 --> 23:20.060
the trick is like, it's the same thing that we're thinking 70,000 years ago, that's responsible

23:20.060 --> 23:25.040
for all the technology that we have now. And it's all tool building. And it's, you know,

23:25.040 --> 23:29.920
and it's not a linear scale. So we were building tools, and we, you know, if you look at some

23:29.920 --> 23:35.000
I think was Homo erectus, you know, just never accelerated with tools. They really had the

23:35.000 --> 23:39.120
same tools for like 2 million years. They, I mean, have really simple things to cut with

23:39.120 --> 23:45.600
and they never had that kind of, I need a better mousetrap kind of thing. And then we

23:45.600 --> 23:51.240
of course did. And so that's why you see this, you know, this nice line where it just keeps

23:51.240 --> 23:55.360
going. But then all of a sudden, all the stuff we're making now, and if you look, like the

23:55.360 --> 23:59.720
basic production, like when did human production, and of course, you've got like the Industrial

23:59.720 --> 24:05.120
Revolution, but it's the curve just goes like this for the entire human. And then all of

24:05.120 --> 24:07.880
a sudden, just like in the last 100 years, it goes up like this.

24:07.880 --> 24:13.680
Yeah, because technology, technology advances exponentially. And at that line that seemed

24:13.680 --> 24:20.840
flat, it was never flat. You're showing you're showing a link on your screen. Oh, something

24:20.840 --> 24:26.440
came up. Interesting. Are you send me a link? Very interesting. I never see. I just showed

24:26.440 --> 24:32.840
it now. Weird. Anyways, we're going to show some of Chris's articles about Chris's and

24:32.840 --> 24:40.720
all that. But yeah, that that line that seemed flat, it was never flat. It's just the difference

24:40.720 --> 24:48.520
between each generation was, you know, you go from one to two, two to four, four to eight,

24:48.520 --> 24:55.720
eight to 16. So it's not really, you know, visible. But at some point, you go 30 steps

24:55.720 --> 25:03.200
exponentially, you hit billion, you know, but our experience is linear. So yes, we have,

25:03.200 --> 25:08.320
we have assumed that we're using all these tools, including radio and television and

25:08.320 --> 25:15.560
newspapers and, you know, early internet and all that, in order to pursue our, you know,

25:15.560 --> 25:23.200
what we assume to be shared goals, right? Because when you had limited sources of interpretation

25:23.200 --> 25:28.320
and distribution of information, obviously, your objectives seem to be shared among the

25:28.320 --> 25:34.680
public because the options were not presented. But now for people who are willing to see

25:34.680 --> 25:40.280
because it's terrifying, but it's also exciting and exhilarating. Somebody said on this podcast,

25:40.280 --> 25:47.480
that's the correct term to use for how we feel in this period, that, you know, the tools

25:47.480 --> 25:55.960
have surpassed our evolution. And so all of our values are open, open to be questioned

25:55.960 --> 26:00.800
and open to be debated and challenged. And exactly because of that, I think some people

26:00.800 --> 26:10.040
are going back to very pure tribalism based on values and cultures and religions and whatever

26:10.040 --> 26:14.000
that they can hold on to. You know, I made this argument, I think two years ago on this

26:14.000 --> 26:20.320
podcast that I think fundamentalist version of religions are going to make a comeback

26:20.320 --> 26:24.400
because when everything seems so uncertain, you want to hold on to whatever that you can

26:24.400 --> 26:31.000
find that give you sense, illusion of certainty and solidity. And then there are a group of

26:31.000 --> 26:36.720
people who just want to stop all these technological advancement or like we have to put a moratorium

26:36.720 --> 26:41.760
on it and we don't need this level of advancement. And, you know, the only thing I can tell those

26:41.760 --> 26:47.280
people is that good luck with that, because our evolution has never been separated from

26:47.280 --> 26:49.600
the evolution of tools and technology.

26:49.600 --> 26:59.920
Yeah, I mean, it's interesting that, you know, if you take someone that just right now and

26:59.920 --> 27:03.320
you take them into a lab and you get them to start making primitive tools, it's interesting

27:03.320 --> 27:08.080
that the left side of the brain starts like acting up, even though they're using, you

27:08.080 --> 27:10.880
know, they may can use their left hand so that would activate normally you think the

27:10.880 --> 27:16.280
right side. But any kind of tool making, it just is such a primitive thing. And there's

27:16.280 --> 27:22.000
just programs in there that are set for making these really simple things. And of course,

27:22.000 --> 27:27.240
that's the same thing that goes into making computers. I mean, we're tapping into the

27:27.240 --> 27:32.520
same element of desire, you know, and it's almost like that Buddhist thing, like, you

27:32.520 --> 27:37.760
know, desire is the cause of suffering because, you know, it's our desire for whatever the

27:37.760 --> 27:43.120
next best thing is that used to be and you're right, it was not flat, but it's nowhere near

27:43.120 --> 27:49.440
the curve that we're dealing with now. And so things become, you know, kind of an existential,

27:49.440 --> 27:54.320
you know, every phone goes by too quick and you can probably upgrade your phone every

27:54.320 --> 28:01.080
year and maybe every six months and computers are, you know, just moving along just way

28:01.080 --> 28:05.720
too quickly for everybody. So we've got this, again, 70,000 year old program that's living

28:05.720 --> 28:11.320
at a pace that it was never intended to. So I think you're right. People go back to fundamentalism

28:11.320 --> 28:20.080
because the core of fundamentalism, however it appears, is the absolute certitude in it.

28:20.080 --> 28:24.520
And that simplifies everything. It just makes everything else just seem, you know, it's

28:24.520 --> 28:30.800
a set of rules. It's like a bureaucracy that if you follow all these rules, you have guaranteed

28:30.800 --> 28:37.680
outcomes. And so I would have to agree with you. I think that that dogma and we know what

28:37.680 --> 28:45.160
is dogma but the inability to, you know, shutting down a question before it even comes up. And

28:45.160 --> 28:50.560
that's what we see so often. It's a frightening thing when you get into academia and the cancel

28:50.560 --> 28:58.840
culture and you see people, you know, stopping a debate before it even happens. And I would

28:58.840 --> 29:03.240
suggest to anyone listening, really get into James Lindsay on this. He's done an outstanding

29:03.240 --> 29:10.720
job of breaking down where all this came from, the history of it, and just reading simple

29:10.720 --> 29:16.800
books to you like Mercuse, where he was able to start off and did it so clearly that says

29:16.800 --> 29:22.800
that, look, you know, if you're on the left, absolutely everything is tolerated. Violence,

29:22.800 --> 29:29.480
spelled out, but anything from the right has to be stopped before it even is thought. So

29:29.480 --> 29:34.080
you stop it for you. You don't wait till someone talks and then censor it. You have to stop

29:34.080 --> 29:35.960
it before they even have that thought.

29:35.960 --> 29:41.080
Oh, you can't even if you're if you're coming from the left, you're not even allowed to

29:41.080 --> 29:48.320
share a platform that is given to somebody who you would recognize or categorize as right

29:48.320 --> 29:54.920
wing. So, you know, earlier on, I had some guests on this podcast is like five years,

29:54.920 --> 30:01.800
six years ago, who would associate with the left. These are like prominent leftists now.

30:01.800 --> 30:05.840
And they had problems with some of the guests that I had later on. Like you have to remove

30:05.840 --> 30:09.280
our episodes. I'm like, there's no way I'm going to do that. You know, it really is a

30:09.280 --> 30:13.800
nonsensical problem that you do. I didn't give you any guarantee that I'm going to ask

30:13.800 --> 30:18.360
you who I'm going to talk to. But they're like, you know, you're giving them you're giving

30:18.360 --> 30:24.560
this argument that is toxic to our cause, air, basically, you're giving it oxygen, and

30:24.560 --> 30:27.080
we're against that. Totally totalitarian.

30:27.080 --> 30:33.160
But yeah, and if you say, well, one group gets to do whatever pre rain total, and the

30:33.160 --> 30:36.920
other group gets to be shut down, then that's interesting. Then you say, Okay, well, how

30:36.920 --> 30:40.320
do you know someone's on the right? Because one of the fascinating things that happens

30:40.320 --> 30:46.520
to me as a university professor is, like, you know, I wouldn't categorize myself as

30:46.520 --> 30:50.680
being on the left or the right, I would say I'm a complex person, my views, I don't even

30:50.680 --> 30:57.120
buy much into the solid reality of a self to begin with. So, you know, I would say it's

30:57.120 --> 31:03.940
a fluid thing with different thoughts. And but, but I, my perception is that I'm very

31:03.940 --> 31:10.160
far on the right. And so when I go into the university, it's, you know, it's just assumed.

31:10.160 --> 31:14.560
And it's interesting, too, because I get labeled being on the right, specifically because I'm

31:14.560 --> 31:18.760
such an advocate for viewpoint diversity, and wanting to get discussions going. And

31:18.760 --> 31:22.800
I want people to talk and debate. And I went, and I often, you know, quote, john Stuart

31:22.800 --> 31:26.280
Mill and say, Look, you don't even know your own argument, unless you know the other side

31:26.280 --> 31:31.820
of it. And that gets me all of a sudden, I got this giant conservative label on me. Right.

31:31.820 --> 31:36.160
And so it's freaking me out. Because I'm like, so that's concerned, like, like, it's not

31:36.160 --> 31:43.920
even I'm like, that's conservative now. Well, I'll tell you this. The African American Museum

31:43.920 --> 31:49.220
of actually me, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, they came out

31:49.220 --> 31:56.800
with something. Those of our viewers and listeners who watch this on YouTube, I'm showing these

31:56.800 --> 32:02.640
screenshots, they came out with whiteness and white culture. This is like a year and

32:02.640 --> 32:08.520
a half ago, I think around the George Floyd whole thing, that they point out some of the

32:08.520 --> 32:16.200
characteristic and signs and elements of this white culture and whiteness.

32:16.200 --> 32:22.480
Rugged individualism, emphasis on scientific method, which is in which includes objective,

32:22.480 --> 32:28.360
rational, linear thinking, cause and effect relationship, quantitative emphasis. But it

32:28.360 --> 32:33.600
also goes to all the way to justice based on English common law, that is whiteness,

32:33.600 --> 32:41.040
therefore it's bad. Competition being number one, win at all costs, win or lose their diatomy,

32:41.040 --> 32:48.480
action orientation, master and control nature, decision making, majority rules. So obviously,

32:48.480 --> 32:54.260
there was a huge backlash against these people and they removed it from their website. Yet,

32:54.260 --> 32:58.760
if you go to their website right now, they have the talking about race section, they

32:58.760 --> 33:03.440
have a whiteness section, and they go all the way down, explain again and stuff. And

33:03.440 --> 33:09.040
then the video at the end of persons talking about it is this vile racist woman, Robin

33:09.040 --> 33:18.000
D'Angelo, the author of White Fragility, that it's not even like hidden or subtle.

33:18.000 --> 33:22.460
It's that this is how it is, we are being racist against white people and that is acceptable

33:22.460 --> 33:27.280
because white people have been empowered. And I echo what you said about James Lindsay.

33:27.280 --> 33:32.480
Lindsay was a guest here almost a year and a half ago on this podcast and it was really

33:32.480 --> 33:38.200
interesting because when we did the episode, few days after that, George Floyd stuff happened

33:38.200 --> 33:43.820
and he was like, I'm just going to release this a little later. I was like, yeah, totally.

33:43.820 --> 33:49.440
But I also had an interesting experience. I went to see the first manned launch of a

33:49.440 --> 33:57.120
SpaceX rocket. He was a test test dragon with the very first astronauts they sent to International

33:57.120 --> 34:01.940
Space Station. And it was the same day that they were burning down number of communities

34:01.940 --> 34:11.760
all around the US. I think it was May 31, 2020. And I was thinking how America has a

34:11.760 --> 34:17.880
choice, such a clear choice, that you have a building culture. I went to see the launch

34:17.880 --> 34:22.520
and all that. It was like three hours drive from here. You have the building culture of

34:22.520 --> 34:27.680
building a rocket, a reusable rocket that sent astronauts to the space station and then

34:27.680 --> 34:32.760
come back. It's just incredible achievement. And on the other hand, you have this cancel

34:32.760 --> 34:38.120
culture which is a destructive culture of basically we just want to remove everything

34:38.120 --> 34:45.600
that exists as a result of this white culture or white supremacy or whatever. And we don't

34:45.600 --> 34:50.240
know what we're going to replace it with. But we do need that a good thing to do is

34:50.240 --> 34:55.060
to removing all of them. And people shouldn't put up with it for any amount of ethical and

34:55.060 --> 35:00.980
moral argument because it is immoral and unethical to begin with that we're going to ruin the

35:00.980 --> 35:04.400
lives of a whole bunch of people because of the color of their skin because we have this

35:04.400 --> 35:12.720
abstract ideal utopia that we might or might not get to it. But so no, there is no ethical

35:12.720 --> 35:16.200
or moral argument whatsoever.

35:16.200 --> 35:20.720
And people have to be really careful because I'm sure you're familiar with the Jane Elliott

35:20.720 --> 35:25.720
experiments when she took these third graders and just said, well, people with brown eyes

35:25.720 --> 35:30.000
are smarter than people with blue eyes. And they all just sucked right up into it. I mean,

35:30.000 --> 35:32.960
they just bought into it and they were treating people horribly. And then she just went in

35:32.960 --> 35:37.680
the next day and reversed it and said, no, it's actually whatever other eye colors. And

35:37.680 --> 35:42.800
she switched it on them and they just followed right along. I mean, so kid, that's that old

35:42.800 --> 35:46.960
program. It's so susceptible to if we hear this category and then we say, well, this

35:46.960 --> 35:54.520
category equals bad, we have to actually become extremely conscious of how susceptible we

35:54.520 --> 35:59.400
are to that for us to actually ever be able to overcome it.

35:59.400 --> 36:03.280
Sorry, I think I lost you for a second.

36:03.280 --> 36:09.880
Yeah, I'm here. I hear you. Yeah.

36:09.880 --> 36:15.800
And I remember my daughter, she came home from school maybe and maybe it was around

36:15.800 --> 36:21.720
third grade and she was all confused and she looked and she goes, dad, am I white? You

36:21.720 --> 36:27.280
know, like it was never like, like an obvious kind of thing to her. And so I like held up

36:27.280 --> 36:32.840
something like typing paper next to her skin. I'm like, do you look white? What do you think?

36:32.840 --> 36:36.280
And she just kind of looked at me, she goes, well, I'm, you know, and I was like, a white

36:36.280 --> 36:41.000
person would be kind of terrifying, right? I mean, it's like if they were like actual

36:41.000 --> 36:48.160
the definition of white. And so it just shows you these are cartoon characters, characters

36:48.160 --> 36:54.400
that we're dealing with. It's so absolutely obvious that they are things that are only

36:54.400 --> 36:57.940
existing in our head. I mean, think about race. I mean, where is it when no one's thinking

36:57.940 --> 37:03.400
about it? And where is it? Like there's so many places you can go. One of the reasons

37:03.400 --> 37:09.280
I, in fact, I was just down close to you, I think in St. Petersburg a couple of months

37:09.280 --> 37:13.160
ago and you can go to beaches and all this. And one of the reasons I love it is because

37:13.160 --> 37:19.360
you see such variation in skin color and just no one doesn't. I mean, it's not recognized.

37:19.360 --> 37:24.680
We're like, we're all just human beings hanging out at the beach. And so, but then you watch

37:24.680 --> 37:30.200
their news channels and it looks like there's this, you know, it's like it's a war going

37:30.200 --> 37:36.720
on. And so, so much of that is covered by the media. And then the susceptibility of

37:36.720 --> 37:40.880
the mind to just fall prey to these simple categories. I mean, and we have to be very

37:40.880 --> 37:46.400
careful what we expose kids to, too, because I think Jane Elliott, it was such a good,

37:46.400 --> 37:50.140
you know, none of that would have been ethical these days to do something like that to these

37:50.140 --> 37:56.080
kids but it just showed so explicitly our susceptibility to thinking in simplistic categories

37:56.080 --> 38:00.680
and then doing really nasty stuff to people if they're in the out group. And you'd think

38:00.680 --> 38:05.640
we would have learned that lesson. And so, anytime you refer to any category, well, you

38:05.640 --> 38:11.240
know, whiteness or white anything or any, again, like I said, with Steven Pinker, you

38:11.240 --> 38:15.580
cannot make reliable judgments about an individual based on their group membership. And if we

38:15.580 --> 38:21.800
just got that to sink in a little and get people to work and realize that, wow, there

38:21.800 --> 38:27.920
really is a lot of variability within these groups and that may be all it would take to

38:27.920 --> 38:33.360
start breaking it down. But you're talking about an old program that's been successful

38:33.360 --> 38:40.240
for like 70,000 years. You know, when you look at the 20th century, it was like the

38:40.240 --> 38:46.040
bloodiest century in human history because it was able to activate this old program and

38:46.040 --> 38:53.700
get us thinking in ways of groups, in group and out group. And, you know, you mix that

38:53.700 --> 38:59.560
old program with technology and it becomes extremely dangerous. And so, everyone's sort

38:59.560 --> 39:03.880
of waiting to see what's going to happen. I don't know if you heard about this thing,

39:03.880 --> 39:08.080
maybe it was James Lindsay was talking about the, you know, the white pill or the black

39:08.080 --> 39:15.600
pill. Right. Yeah. And so, you know, everyone's sort of like, it's such a complex system.

39:15.600 --> 39:20.720
It's very hard to predict very complex systems like this. So we're all sort of just waiting.

39:20.720 --> 39:25.320
And while some of us are optimistic and think maybe we'll have these insights that, you

39:25.320 --> 39:29.940
know, races itself as a construction and the way we're defining it and we'll have these

39:29.940 --> 39:33.840
insights that every time we solve a problem, we just find another problem because that's

39:33.840 --> 39:40.280
what the mind will do endlessly. And then we shift, like I said, in your example, we've

39:40.280 --> 39:45.200
got two worlds. One is a world where we complain and we're a victim and we're miserable. And

39:45.200 --> 39:50.320
the other reality is we're incredibly grateful for this amazing adventure of being a conscious

39:50.320 --> 39:56.800
being on a planet at a time that's unprecedented in all kinds of really cool stuff that we

39:56.800 --> 40:01.280
could be incredibly grateful for. And all of a sudden, we get really happy and we feel

40:01.280 --> 40:06.640
satisfied. And so those two worlds, as you described them, I mean, it is a choice that

40:06.640 --> 40:12.480
we make. And some people have just such a habit. You know, that's the thing about humans

40:12.480 --> 40:16.840
too, we're real susceptible to habits. So we complain, we feel miserable, but we're used

40:16.840 --> 40:24.120
to it. And so it takes a lot of conscious effort, like breaking any habit. You know,

40:24.120 --> 40:28.320
some people do, they put the cigarettes down, they never smoke again. But for other people,

40:28.320 --> 40:33.040
they struggle with it. And as I talk about my mindfulness class, you know, sometimes

40:33.040 --> 40:38.000
we're so unhappy that we feel so comfortable being unhappy that we're actually in a weird

40:38.000 --> 40:47.120
way happy when we're unhappy. And then we get this, you know, feelings of enlightenment,

40:47.120 --> 40:51.800
like you might think in a technical sense, but we feel like, you know, kind of wonderful.

40:51.800 --> 40:55.920
We feel a little bit of joy because we start feeling grateful. But then we feel uncomfortable

40:55.920 --> 41:00.040
with feeling grateful. Because now, all of a sudden, you know, we feel like, oh, this

41:00.040 --> 41:04.080
is my privilege, you know, because privilege became a bad thing. It used to be something

41:04.080 --> 41:12.440
that you were grateful for and pondered on. And it was the origins of a lot of positive

41:12.440 --> 41:18.440
feelings. Now, all of a sudden, if I have a certain amount of things and I live in a

41:18.440 --> 41:23.120
certain time, then all of a sudden, well, you know, things that I didn't even choose,

41:23.120 --> 41:28.000
that I still should be so grateful for, but I didn't choose any of it. And then suddenly

41:28.000 --> 41:32.040
you kind of feel like, well, maybe I shouldn't feel so good about all this. So, but I do

41:32.040 --> 41:38.840
really think, you know, the crossroads, you know, taking the, you know, the white pill,

41:38.840 --> 41:43.680
black pill, feeling some optimism, we really don't know where this is going to go. And

41:43.680 --> 41:50.160
of course, as someone who's got, you know, one lawsuit that took place from 2014 to 2017

41:50.160 --> 41:55.800
and then a second lawsuit that I'm currently in, so I'm kind of living it right at the

41:55.800 --> 42:00.880
front lines, you might say, at a university where you could say, okay, you know, what's

42:00.880 --> 42:05.600
Neibart doing that's so radical? Why is he this radical conservative? I mean, he writes

42:05.600 --> 42:09.880
books on spirituality, he writes books on, you know, neuroscience and Buddhism, he's

42:09.880 --> 42:15.160
trying to transcend this idea of a self and get people to feel a little bit more grateful.

42:15.160 --> 42:20.480
Okay, well, that, you know, what's so like, like radically concerned? Am I so far in the

42:20.480 --> 42:24.840
right now? And so it's very confusing for me to like, because I think things have shifted

42:24.840 --> 42:33.200
so far that, well, I actually call this the Borg theory of conformity. And I know a lot

42:33.200 --> 42:37.480
of people aren't familiar with the Borg, I'm a huge Star Trek fan, so I was, and I have

42:37.480 --> 42:41.080
to explain this to my students because they're like, they have no clue because it was 90s,

42:41.080 --> 42:47.040
you know. But the Borg was this machine, it was half machine, half humans, and it was

42:47.040 --> 42:52.200
– they flew around in space in the cube, which I thought was interesting because, you

42:52.200 --> 42:56.720
know, nature is filled with wiggles and yet the mind always tries to square off things

42:56.720 --> 43:02.840
and create edges and stuff and flatten out the messiness of nature. So they represented

43:02.840 --> 43:10.280
technology in its kind of most advanced form because they were able to, you know, connect

43:10.280 --> 43:13.760
the organic to the computers.

43:13.760 --> 43:18.320
But the most amazing thing that they predicted in the 90s is that the Borg flew around space

43:18.320 --> 43:24.520
and had one mission, destroy individuality. I mean, that was the mission of the Borg.

43:24.520 --> 43:29.440
They would just take up species and they would steal their technology and – but the most

43:29.440 --> 43:34.320
important thing they would steal is their uniqueness as an individual and anything that

43:34.320 --> 43:40.280
was different, anything that – it's always like this, you know, species that was – they

43:40.280 --> 43:47.480
would even say, you know, resistance is futile. You know, you're going to basically join

43:47.480 --> 43:54.520
us in becoming this one collective mindset. So it really, to me, if you haven't seen

43:54.520 --> 43:58.960
it before, you know, I would suggest to people like just watch a couple of things, you know,

43:58.960 --> 44:04.680
very short YouTube clips. Just type in Borg and Star Trek and you'll see how – I think

44:04.680 --> 44:14.200
it was almost prophetic insight into where we were going in terms of this kind of mass

44:14.200 --> 44:21.280
group, this mindset that would just kind of steamroll over things and be like, you know,

44:21.280 --> 44:28.200
if we even have a hint that you're not conforming, then you're gone. And so – and then of

44:28.200 --> 44:36.240
course, that was in some ways a really short version of the last century. And then of course,

44:36.240 --> 44:41.960
it resulted in what – I mean, some estimates are up to 100 million deaths, you know. It's

44:41.960 --> 44:48.400
– I think we have to be pretty careful to see, you know, how we're going to deal with

44:48.400 --> 44:50.480
this for this century.

44:50.480 --> 44:56.760
Yeah, which can potentially be far worse, you know, because, yeah, we haven't learned

44:56.760 --> 45:03.200
anything and history rhymes because basically human nature persists. That's the reason

45:03.200 --> 45:09.360
of it. But the difference right now is that we also have the technological tool to make

45:09.360 --> 45:18.060
that Borg structure or hive mind reality into an actual reality, you know, first through

45:18.060 --> 45:24.360
media and social media and eventually through genetic engineering. And, you know, we are

45:24.360 --> 45:34.720
at the very, very vital and extremely important point in history that, you know, we – I

45:34.720 --> 45:42.280
do believe that we either go into evolve into a post-human species or we just end up annihilating

45:42.280 --> 45:49.640
ourselves basically. This is not a place we can stay much longer. I want to talk more

45:49.640 --> 45:54.120
about this, but I think we laid the ground for about 45 minutes for you to talk a little

45:54.120 --> 45:59.440
in depth about the cases that you're dealing with, your lawsuits. You mentioned that you

45:59.440 --> 46:07.440
sent me links to some articles from 2014, Neibar versus Slippery Rock University. And

46:07.440 --> 46:14.200
there's another one. This is from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, psychology professor as Slippery

46:14.200 --> 46:17.080
Rock University claims gender discrimination.

46:17.080 --> 46:24.000
All right, Chris, let's get to where these problems are coming from. You mentioned that

46:24.000 --> 46:29.720
they started in 2014. You're involved in the second lawsuit. And let's hear whatever

46:29.720 --> 46:35.440
there is to hear about it and how it all begun. How is it going and where do you think it's

46:35.440 --> 46:36.440
headed?

46:36.440 --> 46:42.840
Well, again, I transitioned from the old world to the new world. And again, that happened

46:42.840 --> 46:51.960
sometime around 2014. But I started off my career late 90s and academia was really a

46:51.960 --> 46:59.160
place that was pretty minimum in politics. You could walk around and you could actually

46:59.160 --> 47:06.240
say who you voted for and people might joke about it. Maybe someone came across as being

47:06.240 --> 47:11.160
on the right. And if you look at the numbers back then, it was always in balance, but it

47:11.160 --> 47:19.120
was something like two liberals for every one conservative. And so the numbers, they

47:19.120 --> 47:25.000
were always in balance, but there was enough of diversity there that it wasn't really a

47:25.000 --> 47:31.440
hive mind. And then it wasn't really something coherent, something that, like you said, it

47:31.440 --> 47:37.320
all became more real when with the internet and with that kind of instantaneous communication

47:37.320 --> 47:41.720
that we have now that hive mind has become much more externalized and almost a reality

47:41.720 --> 47:50.920
to it. So I was in a department that did have a male chairperson. He died from cancer and

47:50.920 --> 47:56.840
then that's kind of when everything changed. So he was out of the scene and it just, that's

47:56.840 --> 48:03.080
when I remember everything just sort of turned. It seemed to me that the main mission was get

48:03.080 --> 48:04.080
him out.

48:04.080 --> 48:05.080
This is why you-

48:05.080 --> 48:14.800
Well, this was about 2014. It was maybe earlier than that, 2012 to 2013, because I found myself

48:14.800 --> 48:23.520
being removed from every committee. I was getting really horrible reviews. I was getting

48:23.520 --> 48:29.080
complaints because certain things I would do at meetings, like supposedly I slammed

48:29.080 --> 48:33.240
my fist down on a desk one time at a meeting. I'm like, I don't think I've ever slammed

48:33.240 --> 48:41.200
my fist down ever on anything. So all these complaints started coming up and like I said,

48:41.200 --> 48:45.440
I was just so excluded. The message was so clear. But I was trying to figure out like

48:45.440 --> 48:51.920
what did I do? And it's true that I did speak up a few times and I did have a different

48:51.920 --> 48:56.640
opinion but at the time I thought, well, different opinions are just that. They don't mean hate.

48:56.640 --> 49:01.880
They don't mean, they're just different opinions. And so there was a time when they wanted to

49:01.880 --> 49:06.240
hire and a lot of these problems started when they were doing new hires. So they wanted

49:06.240 --> 49:12.600
to hire someone and I found a really qualified male applicant and I was an advocate for him

49:12.600 --> 49:20.240
and they went with a far less qualified. And it wasn't just a little far less. It was like

49:20.240 --> 49:26.560
order of magnitude less than this other individual. And I really fought for the guy, not because

49:26.560 --> 49:32.000
he's a guy. I just thought because he was better at the job. He had more experience,

49:32.000 --> 49:38.240
far more experience. And then the person that they hired had no formal experience but tons

49:38.240 --> 49:44.600
of political activism. And that's when I started kind of picking up on this, this transformation

49:44.600 --> 49:51.440
where departments went from being ordinary places of discourse to the hive mind starting

49:51.440 --> 49:59.840
to form. And the politics were more important than the scholarship. And that was a really,

49:59.840 --> 50:04.680
I don't think I really caught on to that until maybe I was in the middle of the lawsuit or

50:04.680 --> 50:11.800
it started to hit me of, okay, you know, this is what's happening. And it's not just my

50:11.800 --> 50:15.280
university, it's actually happening in a lot of, that's when I started hearing stories

50:15.280 --> 50:25.720
from other places. So the university now, again, it's an all-female, all-white department

50:25.720 --> 50:34.440
in psychology in terms of full-time faculty. And the remarkable thing about this is that

50:34.440 --> 50:42.200
we've also just brought in a new position, the infamous diversity, inclusion, and equity

50:42.200 --> 50:50.960
department. So we now have a department that does that. And to me, I'm like, well, okay,

50:50.960 --> 50:56.000
that sounds noble, you know, diversity and all of them except the equity thing seems

50:56.000 --> 50:59.440
to be a little bit more difficult to understand exactly.

50:59.440 --> 51:07.020
It's diversity, equity, and inclusion. It should be diversity, inclusion, and equity

51:07.020 --> 51:13.440
because then it would write as D.I. Now it's D.E.I. D.I. is way closer to what is going

51:13.440 --> 51:18.640
on with this concept than the other thing. Please continue, sorry.

51:18.640 --> 51:23.320
I had the same insight, I thought, because I kept putting the letters together. Well,

51:23.320 --> 51:26.480
actually if you switch these around a little bit, it's actually D.I. which is pretty much

51:26.480 --> 51:38.600
what it felt like they wanted me to do. But it really got a little intense in terms of,

51:38.600 --> 51:43.920
in fact, it even got so bad that, so I had filed the federal lawsuit and then I was kicked

51:43.920 --> 51:48.280
out of the department. And that was really remarkable to think that like I could get

51:48.280 --> 51:53.080
kicked out of the department. I thought the lawsuit would keep you, they would watch themselves

51:53.080 --> 51:58.520
for retaliation. They wouldn't want to do something so overt as to retaliate. So they

51:58.520 --> 52:03.120
kicked me out and then it took a lot of work to get my lawyer and reminding them what they

52:03.120 --> 52:10.640
just did. And then they sort of took it back and said, well, we didn't really do that.

52:10.640 --> 52:17.760
But then it was about 2017 and we were doing a lot of settlement talks. And I don't think

52:17.760 --> 52:23.560
I still, you know, it's been such a slow process for me to really put together what's going

52:23.560 --> 52:29.640
on that I still, and maybe I trivialized it because it was just too overwhelming. You

52:29.640 --> 52:36.240
know, particularly in 2017, I was the only voice that I knew of that was dealing with

52:36.240 --> 52:44.120
this. I felt really isolated, really alone, zero support. And most of the stuff I got

52:44.120 --> 52:48.360
was like, look, you know, you started seeing these hints like, well, you're just a privileged

52:48.360 --> 52:52.800
white male. So, you know, don't cry about it when some of your privileges get taken

52:52.800 --> 52:58.120
away. And so it was that sins of the father mentality that was like, I have to pay the

52:58.120 --> 53:04.880
bill because supposedly my people who had the same skin color and gender as me did this

53:04.880 --> 53:10.640
horrible stuff according to you, but I'm left paying the bill. And that mentality seemed

53:10.640 --> 53:16.120
absolutely unethical. And it seemed very primitive. It seemed like the way we would have, again,

53:16.120 --> 53:22.680
maybe thought, you know, thousands of years ago. And so it was just, you know, it was

53:22.680 --> 53:32.080
shocking that this was happening, that it could be so absolutely simplistic. But every

53:32.080 --> 53:36.440
time I would say, well, let me challenge this a little bit. Let me see if maybe that's really

53:36.440 --> 53:40.080
on track. Every time I would challenge it, I guess kept finding more and more evidence

53:40.080 --> 53:45.160
to support this. Like, okay, well, you know, and I've still asked my, I've asked my university

53:45.160 --> 53:52.080
several times, well, what did I do? You know, just tell me. Because I've literally been

53:52.080 --> 53:56.960
guilty of this for so many years now of something worthy of being kicked out of departments

53:56.960 --> 54:03.600
because I've been kicked out of two now. But anyway, to get back to the settlement, it

54:03.600 --> 54:07.800
was a little overwhelming at the time. And they offered me a pretty good deal. They said,

54:07.800 --> 54:12.640
we'll let you go off and you can do your own department in cognitive science. You can kind

54:12.640 --> 54:20.280
of do whatever you want to do. And to be honest, that felt very enticing. I was very excited

54:20.280 --> 54:26.960
about that. So I said, okay, you know, we'll do this. So I was in another department and

54:26.960 --> 54:30.680
I got to develop a cognitive science concentration. So it's not like a major or anything. It's

54:30.680 --> 54:34.760
just like this, you know, kind of small little thing that some people might be interested

54:34.760 --> 54:38.400
in. And I felt pretty comfortable with it. And I developed six new courses and everything

54:38.400 --> 54:44.560
was going really well. In fact, I had students filling up the classes. They really liked

54:44.560 --> 54:49.360
it because I offered classes on consciousness and left right brain and artificial intelligence

54:49.360 --> 54:54.080
and things the university hadn't even thought of offering before. And so the classes were

54:54.080 --> 55:02.760
filling up. Everything's going okay. Okay, so round two. And so I'm going to tell you

55:02.760 --> 55:07.200
this story and I'm going to tell you it like as I absolutely remember it. And it's one

55:07.200 --> 55:11.560
of these, it's such a powerful story, I think, because it gets at exactly what's wrong with

55:11.560 --> 55:16.400
the universities now. So we had, so I was in this department, it's called Interdisciplinary

55:16.400 --> 55:21.440
Programs and it was a good place for me to be because they were all social scientists,

55:21.440 --> 55:28.800
anthropology, sociology. And so it was a place for me to do something that was eclectic like

55:28.800 --> 55:34.480
cognitive science. And so I walk into our spring meeting and I was about 45 minutes

55:34.480 --> 55:38.840
late because my daughter had a medical, she had an impacted wisdom tooth so I had to run

55:38.840 --> 55:43.720
her up and get her fixed before the meeting. So anyway, I run in, I'm just 45, the meeting

55:43.720 --> 55:49.620
lasts all day. So 45 minutes late isn't, it's like a morning to late afternoon, four o'clock

55:49.620 --> 55:53.800
or something meeting. So I didn't think that's such a big deal. And I walk into the room.

55:53.800 --> 56:00.560
I remember we're a social science department, you know, Department of Interdisciplinary

56:00.560 --> 56:04.720
Programs. So the whole thing is based around social science. I walk in and there's a huge

56:04.720 --> 56:13.840
thing on the board and it says the Department of Cultural Studies and Diversity, big, you

56:13.840 --> 56:19.560
know, Department of Culture. I'm like, okay, that's a little strange. Mission statement,

56:19.560 --> 56:25.880
diversity, inclusion, equity. I'm like, okay, well, that's weird too because where did that

56:25.880 --> 56:32.240
come from? I was soon told that they had, in my absence, redefined themselves, which

56:32.240 --> 56:37.160
they're not allowed to do, as a department. They redefined themselves as a new department.

56:37.160 --> 56:43.080
They're no longer a social science department. They are now a department of cultural diversity,

56:43.080 --> 56:46.960
cultural studies and diversity. Okay. And their mission statement isn't social science

56:46.960 --> 56:55.560
any longer. The mission statement is the inclusion, diversity and equity. And I was a little confused

56:55.560 --> 57:00.240
and I thought, well, this is really strange. And they said, well, where does cognitive

57:00.240 --> 57:04.600
science fit in this? And it didn't take me too long to figure. I'm like, it doesn't fit

57:04.600 --> 57:05.600
in at all.

57:05.600 --> 57:06.600
It doesn't, yeah.

57:06.600 --> 57:14.200
Cognitive science is a scientific discipline. It has nothing to do with political activism.

57:14.200 --> 57:18.000
And they said, well, you need to leave. You're no longer part of the department. And at the

57:18.000 --> 57:23.720
time the dean was present and that was it. It was like, you're gone. And so the irony

57:23.720 --> 57:28.560
of that is we're at a time where we get these new departments of diversity, inclusion and

57:28.560 --> 57:33.320
equity. And of course, the first thing I did when I went back to my office is I wrote the

57:33.320 --> 57:38.800
president of the university. I wrote the provost. I wrote HR. I wrote the diversity office.

57:38.800 --> 57:44.040
I just sat and wrote a letter explaining what just happened to me. That's not even

57:44.040 --> 57:49.760
permissible within our own guidelines. We're not allowed to just make up a new program

57:49.760 --> 57:53.040
out of any. It's like imagine going into biology one day and they don't like some biologists

57:53.040 --> 57:56.440
because they think that they're on this political side.

57:56.440 --> 58:02.520
I'll give you a better example that is more sensible for everybody. This is exactly what

58:02.520 --> 58:08.120
happened in Seattle when a bunch of these people went and they created autonomous zone.

58:08.120 --> 58:12.980
And they said, this is our territory now. It's not Seattle. It's not even the U.S.

58:12.980 --> 58:17.440
This is a territory that is just, we were just built a tier and there are people still

58:17.440 --> 58:22.960
living there. There are still shops. And when they ask the mayor of Seattle, hey, what is

58:22.960 --> 58:27.000
up with what's going on with all these people? She said, we're probably going to have a summer

58:27.000 --> 58:33.680
of love. That was her explanation. Also coming from the same political ideology and political

58:33.680 --> 58:39.880
perspective. So it's, it sounds like exact same thing happened in the academic set up.

58:39.880 --> 58:44.360
It was just a smaller scale of the exact same thing. Because as I wrote all of these, again,

58:44.360 --> 58:48.640
I got a bunch of mixed responses. Sometimes they said, well, you know, that's just the

58:48.640 --> 58:55.320
tough luck of your life. Just live with it. And then they said other things like, well,

58:55.320 --> 58:58.720
you know, they never really did. They are just complete denial. Like, no, they never

58:58.720 --> 59:04.440
did that. And it went back and forth. But the interesting thing is they never investigated

59:04.440 --> 59:10.320
it. They never, they were never like, you know, they did this thing that was so, it

59:10.320 --> 59:16.040
would be so against their philosophy. If you ask someone and put it in different terms,

59:16.040 --> 59:20.600
you know, say something like, you know, you've got a, you know, an all, a mostly male department

59:20.600 --> 59:25.000
and there's one female or you could play the race issue with it. And then everyone just

59:25.000 --> 59:29.560
got together and just kicked this person out. You know, it would have been, now that would

59:29.560 --> 59:34.880
have been absolutely unacceptable. And heads would have rolled. I mean, everything would

59:34.880 --> 59:42.000
have, but because I have a certain status as, you know, color, my skin, I mean, my gender,

59:42.000 --> 59:46.720
for some reason, this stuff comes together and it's kind of like, well, it's just him.

59:46.720 --> 59:50.160
And that's that sins of the father again. Like you're paying for this stuff. You had

59:50.160 --> 59:55.320
nothing to do with it. And they have, they didn't do a single thing. They didn't investigate

59:55.320 --> 59:59.680
it. I was even told by the head of HR, she just, I was explaining the set of meeting

59:59.680 --> 01:00:03.840
to her and she just said, look, I don't care what happened in the past. You know, the only

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:09.960
thing I'm concerned about is what's happening right now. And the problem with that is again,

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:17.240
obviously there's just something special about my unique setup that's, that seems to give,

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:22.240
you know, the red light to these kinds of behaviors. And one of the things I think we

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:27.320
need to really work on is some, I'm not a very consistent human being, but I really

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:32.180
like, you know, and yes, these are all social, maybe they're all social constructs, countries

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:36.440
are social constructs. But if we're really going to work together as a civilization with

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:43.280
some kind of coherency, we have to have some kind of consistency. We can't just let some

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:49.200
groups absolutely redefine reality and completely get away with it. And then other groups be

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:53.080
powerless. I mean, that's the exact oppression that they're talking about. They're saying

01:00:53.080 --> 01:01:01.000
we get to construct reality, your version of reality isn't valid. And I mean, it was

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:06.920
a, it was a pretty intense experience. And then they just threw me into a department

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:13.600
of one. So I went from, you know, being in an actual department with, you know, I think

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:18.040
it was eight or nine people. And suddenly I'm like, on this little island of misfit

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:24.200
toys, like, but I'm all alone. That's like, well, we'll put you off in your own department.

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:30.840
And so it's really, you know, punishment after punishment, department, department of white

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:31.840
supremacy.

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:40.560
You know, I really think again, well, one of the problems I had too is that I was, there's

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:46.000
a guy from the military, he's a retired lieutenant colonel. And, and we got along pretty well

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:51.680
because we both thought so much about teaching students how to think for themselves rather

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:56.760
than what to think. And we just really thought that was important. And we kind of clicked

01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:01.880
and he was very good. He was an excellent teacher. He had this ability to go in and

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:06.800
really shake up people's reality systems, which I think is part of what education is

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:11.800
about, you know, shake things up a little bit, get you thinking and get you to understand

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:15.480
how the mind works. So you can, you know, that's like here, here's our gift. We'll

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:18.280
teach you how the mind works. Then you can think about whatever you want and believe

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:23.980
whatever you want, but we're not here to tell you what to believe and what to think.

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:27.400
And so we connected up and he was in that department with me, that interdisciplinary

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:31.200
programs department. He was the leadership person, which fit in also nicely with all

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:36.640
this. And they got rid of him very quickly. I mean, he, he was on the chopping block way

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:43.560
before I was. And so they had kicked him out first. And then they, depending on how you

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:47.720
want to read it, they either fired him, they gave him to classes started in three days.

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:52.560
He didn't get a contract until three days before classes started. And so he had, you

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:57.080
know, by their own account, they would, it should have been out months before by their

01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:02.700
own rules. But anyway, the short version is, you know, it could have maybe some, my association

01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:07.880
with him. So that's the thing. Like if we're going to, if we're going to really improve

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:12.520
society, me and you can talk. Now, if you go talk to some other person that I don't

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:19.880
really care for, that shouldn't really affect our relationship. Like, why do I care who

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:24.000
you talk? Like, why can't we have a multiplicity and, and understand like, look, there's a

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.360
lot of selves in us and, and, and, and there's a lot of different sides to our personality

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:33.900
and it's a complex picture. Why does it have to be set up? Like, well, if you are friends

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:39.560
with this person, then I can't be friends with you. And to me, I think we're seeing

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:44.600
that break a little bit. I'm sure you've seen those conversations between like Ben Shapiro

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:49.040
and Russell Brand and people who disagree with each other, but still we're learning

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:53.960
to talk again. And we're learning that even if I disagree with you, that doesn't mean

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:58.760
I hate you. It just means I disagree with you. And so I do see some hope. That's why

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:03.360
I was saying I'm much more of a white pill person. I, in spite of all the stuff that's

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:09.800
happened to me and spending 10 years in court and on my second lawsuit and, and it's not,

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:15.160
you know, who knows how it's really going right now. But, but I feel extremely confident

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:20.280
that, you know, that this will turn in my favor because you can't just do this. You

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:25.960
can't, I mean, the school has no policy that says that they could have done this. It violated

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:29.880
the lawsuit settlement that said, look, we're going to put you here. But they had no power

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:35.800
to just kick me out that one day. So that's, that's really a huge percent of what the lawsuit

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:42.120
is about. Because if we really want to improve, it's very difficult to create a bureaucracy

01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:46.560
around treating other people nice. You know, it's very difficult to say, well, you know,

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:53.200
like, you know, because some freedom is just having that ability to be a jerk some days.

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:56.720
And so, but, but you can see us, we're really trying to do that. We're trying to like in

01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:01.560
court, I think political incorrectness, like political correctness movement, that is kind

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:09.440
of the beginning of this bureaucracy around how we treat other people. Now, the thing

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:14.400
is, the irony of all that is, is it's really not such a bad thing to treat other people

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:18.400
in a decent way. But I don't think we can create it into a bureaucracy. We can't have

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:25.480
rules. You must be nice to this person. And if we are, and I guess the reason I'm saying

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:30.080
that is because, do you ever hear the wonderful saying from the East, and Alan Watts used

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:34.500
to always say it, he said, when the wrong person uses the right means, the right means

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:42.760
work in the wrong way. And so what's happening here is, it's a noble, maybe virtuous idea.

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:48.740
But in the wrong hands, what ends up happening is, we create a whole set of like niceties

01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:53.000
for some people, but then other people can, you know, burn at the stake and like, we're

01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:02.160
okay with that. And so, you know, but I, you know, I'm optimistic. I haven't yet heard

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:09.440
one person, Jonathan Haidt, Jordan Peterson, and even James Lindsay, I haven't listened

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:15.640
to everything that he has done, but I haven't really heard the smoking gun of, okay, well,

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:21.560
here's how we fix it. Have you come across anyone with like...

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:32.200
You know, it's, it's a matter of what that it is, you know, what are we fixing? Because

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:39.760
I think this is a, yes, it's revealing what some people think, because this is not like

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:45.360
bunch of people at the top of the hierarchy of bureaucracy, who are pushing this forward.

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:50.120
They're also supported by tens of millions of people who, you know, they're the same

01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:57.240
people who would vote for further restrictions, for vaccine mandates, vaccine passports, just

01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:05.400
basically some kind of a, you know, supreme authority. Because most of these people are

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:10.480
atheists, they have replaced that supreme authority with government. And government

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:19.380
now has merged with corporate monopolies, big tech monopolies, more obvious than others.

01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:27.320
So the fix from my perspective, because I see the solution as access and choice. And

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:34.700
I see the trend of technological evolution towards more access and more choice. This

01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:43.280
obviously is disrupting some of our own structures, including the society, including institutions.

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:48.960
But then we have to make the choice between whether or not these structures that we have

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:55.200
built and they've worked for as long as they have, are we really insistent on keeping these

01:07:55.200 --> 01:08:02.960
structures intact, even though they've been rotted to the core? Or we just move on to

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:10.960
whatever comes next, and we're building the alternative at the same time. So the solution

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:19.240
is building, because the problem is cancelling. And it's being driven from centralized points

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:24.640
of authority, centralized structures of authority, which have emerged in the form of monopolies.

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:29.980
You know, government is a monopoly, academia is a monopoly. So even the right questions

01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:36.880
are not being asked, because the questions need to be asked that pursue the aim and the

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:42.960
objective of people who are running these monopolies. If you're running a university

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:47.480
and somebody comes and say, hey, I want to talk about race and intelligence, you're not

01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:52.360
going to do that, because people who are supporting you and funding you are not okay with that.

01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:56.720
But that is probably one of the most important topics that we do need to talk about, because

01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:00.720
it's affecting everything else, especially now that we're building artificial intelligence.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:09.160
You know what I'm saying? So the solution is not a utopian solution. The solution is

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:14.120
allowing individuals to experience themselves in a de-central kind of a manner, which is

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:19.080
the equivalent of being able to go to different shopping stores and buy whatever you want,

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:24.880
and then form tribes in a voluntary kind of a way. That, you know, we see the evidence

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:31.880
of that online and in virtual kind of environments far more than this world, because access and

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:37.560
choice is limited in this world by design. But digitally, you know, like World of Warcraft,

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:41.880
that was a society of people who came together around this video game, you know, they all

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:46.800
coming from different backgrounds. None of that mattered. You came together to achieve

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:51.800
certain kind of objective within that game. And then you went on and joined your other

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:56.520
tribes, who could be, you know, your classmates or family. So you didn't have one specific

01:09:56.520 --> 01:10:01.760
kind of a tribe. You had different tribes for different objectives. And so I think this

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:07.880
is where we are headed. I'm also judging based on developments that are happening technologically.

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:11.960
You know, we're moving from web two, which is what we have now to web three, which is

01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:17.200
serverless decentralized. Nobody owns the data. Everybody who is in the network own

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:22.480
the network, but nobody really owns it. It's decentralized. And they're serverless. So

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:26.480
you don't have like Twitter, they were like, Oh, you're talking in the way that we don't

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:30.560
like you to talk about, we just kind of silence you, we're going to remove you. But at the

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:35.960
same time, there are a lot of push. I don't know if you saw a so called whistleblower

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:39.680
emerge from Facebook saying that Facebook allowing people to say whatever they want

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:46.680
for profit. And the solution that she provided is for government to have more basically supervision.

01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:53.880
To more control over the big tech that everybody calling nonsense on that. And she's an instrument

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:58.480
of furthering this monopoly, basically merging it with the government. So I think that's

01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:04.680
where we are that people have more access and more choices because of our tools that

01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:08.460
have advanced in a way that you know, the president of United States probably wouldn't

01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:14.160
even have access to this level of technology 20 years ago. And people who are invested

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:22.240
in those monopolies and in those centralized, or centrally determined objectives, they're

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:26.240
throwing everything they can at it because they're losing control.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:33.000
Hmm. Yeah, actually, if I had some input with that, it's actually it's similar in some ways.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:38.680
Because one of the ways I see out of this is is just practicing really deeply into spirituality

01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:45.360
because the whole trip of most spiritual traditions is that particularly in the East is that you're

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:51.360
just not this body. And so it's that recognition like race is really trivial, my gender is

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:58.040
really trivial. And yet we've escalated these to such self defining qualities that, you

01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:02.320
know, there's this whole thing where kids try to figure out what their gender is. And

01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:06.840
yet at the same time, the spiritual movement is saying, your gender is really not who you

01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:11.960
are. So really, why is why even think about it? It's not who you are.

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:17.640
I think, actually, if I may say this, because we obviously been talking about this for a

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:22.800
while, just you and me, and we've been thinking about this much, much longer. And I think

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:29.200
now because there is a equivalent in the digital world of everything that is happening here,

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:34.040
it's very important to make this distinction that yes, you're not your body, but at the

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:41.120
same time, you need your body to survive in this structure that is a society that is built

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:47.800
by humans who are not necessarily smarter than you are. So I think more than focusing

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:55.480
on the spiritual side, it's more profound to recognize the difference between who you

01:12:55.480 --> 01:13:02.120
are in this body and in this form and who you really are objectively. Right? And when

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:08.040
you see that difference, then your race and your culture wouldn't make that much of a

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:14.240
difference compared to your avatar that you use in some video games. For example, this

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:19.460
is how how you want to represent yourself in the digital world. This is how you represented

01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:25.800
because of the game of evolution in this world. Yet none of it is objectively real. These

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:32.680
are constructs. Objectively, what is real, that's for you to figure out on your own.

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:39.160
There can't be any kind of an objective directive for that either. So it becomes a game.

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:47.800
Yeah, the body, you're stuck with it. And so, you know, it's not this kind of thing

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:52.560
like just, you know, stop working out or anything. But the idea is that it's just not central

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:58.480
to your identity. And then it's that neti neti movement where you're just not this,

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:02.320
not that. So you say, well, I'm not really my age. I'm not really my gender. I'm not

01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:06.960
really this name. I'm not really... And then you strip all that away and then you get back

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:11.600
down to this real mystery that's impossible to put into words. But it's far more who you

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:18.200
are. And in that way, so again, and it sounds contradictory in some ways, but you move away

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:25.400
from this. It's actually what Jung called the quest of the hero. The quest of the hero

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:33.080
was to be embedded in this massive collective and to venture out individually and explore

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:40.040
your own path. I love that one place in the, it was the legends of King Arthur where the

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:44.240
Knights of the Round Table, when they entered the dark forest, they had to enter at their

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:49.200
own place. They couldn't go where there was a path. And so that's the thing. It's like

01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:54.400
we're all having this adventure of figuring out our own identity. And it seems like it's

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:59.400
moving from the collective identity that culture tells us and they just tell us this. And well,

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:06.160
here's who you are to the adventure of stripping all that away and seeing what's left. And

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:10.920
in some cases, you have these transcendent experiences. And this is where these, you

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:17.160
know, like Nisargadatta or, you know, Ramana Maharshi and these like really classic spiritual

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:23.440
teachers, I mean, they were so, their whole practice centered around removing illusion

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:29.480
and getting at what is true. And there's just certain things that, you know, culture, it's

01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:34.760
so pervasive, conformity is so pervasive. We don't even realize how often we think,

01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:38.840
well, I'm thinking for myself. But you don't realize that your thoughts aren't even your

01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:43.860
own either. You didn't invent a language. You didn't invent half the things that you're

01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:47.840
thinking about. Would you still think of the same thing if you were born a thousand years

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:51.880
ago on the other end of the globe? And what we need to get to the original, okay, what's

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:58.200
the common, you know, what am I beyond all these illusory social roles? And then you

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:07.320
come to some very peaceful places and it's very hard to be combative when you get into

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:12.200
that state. But that's, you know, maybe just a small part of it. I think like anything,

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:17.880
it's a complex problem. It's not gonna be one easy, there's never one, you know, switch

01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:23.560
to flick when it comes to complex problems. It's gonna be, you know, all kinds of things

01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:30.520
that have to come together. But, you know, the Stoics had a great saying, you know, the

01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:35.200
obstacle is the way. And so what I do is I look at all these obstacles and I say, well,

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:41.040
you know, this is the way. And so much of what I've dealt with has given me deeper insights

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:46.400
on how to deal with this stuff, you know, deeper, more interesting tricks on how to

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:52.400
deal with, you know, being kicked out over and over and dealing with bureaucracy. And

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:58.480
you see this, it's a funny thing where cancel culture backfires. They get rid of these people

01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:04.300
and then they end up becoming famous. They're doing podcasts now, they're doing book deals.

01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:08.760
And so, you know, or even like what happened with Dave Chappelle, you know, they say, well,

01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:13.040
you know, we're gonna cancel and then it really doesn't seem to work. There's something about

01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:18.480
that path of individuation. Again, so I think our species, you know, we had to have most

01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:22.880
of us be conformist, but we also needed some percentage of us that were individuals. I

01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:27.280
mean, how do you grow? How do you come up with something new unless someone breaks the

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:32.760
mold? And so I think we've got these people on the hero's journey and they're out there

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:38.640
being individuals, they're resisting the board mentality. And the funny thing about them

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:45.040
is, you know, the collective thinks that they've destroyed them, but they've empowered them.

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:49.840
And suddenly, they're having book deals and they don't even have like real jobs anymore.

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:53.480
They just, you know, real in a sense like, you know, nine to five kind of thing. They're

01:17:53.480 --> 01:18:00.560
just enjoying what they're doing, going on podcasts and, you know, creating discussions

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:07.600
about what happened to them. I mean, would Jordan Peterson really be where he's at if

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:14.760
the whole pronoun debate didn't kind of launch him in the fame? I mean, on the one hand,

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:21.400
I mean, he's a smart guy, but, you know, he got thrown into the limelight because of a

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:26.720
particular debate that wanted to cast him out, but they never were able to do it. They

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:33.080
made him more powerful than he could have ever been as an ordinary university professor

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:36.200
if that debate had never taken place.

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:42.660
Yeah, Jordan Peterson is a perfect example, obviously, for him standing up in academia,

01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:49.160
but also they cut his budget. I was in Toronto at a time when all of this was happening and,

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:53.060
you know, leftists were out of control back then in Canada. I think now they've pretty

01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:59.960
much taken over all the institutions in that country in kind of a very non-competitive

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:06.800
kind of way, but when they cut Jordan Peterson's budget, they crowdsourced and they raised

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:11.560
like, I think something like 10 times the amount that he would have gotten. So that

01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:16.400
was like a flicker and I think it was like 2017, something like that, that, hey, you

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:21.880
don't really need institutions, this whole connectivity globally, because it would be

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:27.240
very silly to say that only Canadians are learning from Jordan Peterson or only, you

01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:31.600
know, English-speaking people are learning from, for example, Jordan Peterson. There

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:36.460
are people all around the world and you've got like a couple million people each chipping

01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:41.700
like two dollars, you know, all of a sudden he's making tens of millions of dollars, which

01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:46.880
as you said, made him more powerful.

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:53.840
The other thing is this concept of good and bad, right and wrong, again, objectively yes,

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:59.840
they don't exist, but when you're on a boat and somebody start putting a hole in that

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:06.360
boat, because there is a context, you understand what is good and what is bad in a very obvious

01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:13.280
kind of a way, right? Now, if your boat end up sinking, you might find some kind of a

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:18.400
treasure that's been buried, you know, under the, you know, wrecks of a ship under the

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:23.320
ocean and all that. Yes, that's a possibility, but also it's a suggestion that there is no

01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:30.040
such a thing as absolute good and bad. You know, I was telling someone else very unhappy

01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:37.000
about lockdowns during COVID and stuff and very activist against critical race theory.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:42.400
So I was telling her, hey, without lockdowns, most parents wouldn't have found out what

01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:48.920
is being taught at public school in K to 12 education system, including a lot of this

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:53.000
critical race theory. And she said, yeah, you're right. I'm like, well, so lockdowns,

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.960
were they good and bad? You know, in the objective sense, you cannot say whether they were good

01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:03.600
and bad, because if they end up leading to some kind of a actual enlightenment as a result

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:07.600
of all of this, well, they were all good, but they were also bad because a lot of people

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:12.120
got harmed by them. So I think this is, this is an important thing that people begin to

01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:18.920
understand that, Hey, I can be, let's say a conservative Jesus believer, but when someone

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:26.640
like Dave Rubin, who's coming from the left and talking common sense, I can rely on some

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:32.960
of his perspective and some of his realizations in order to build myself that raft that Buddha

01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:36.160
talks about, you know, you need a raft to cross the river, but you're doing that on

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:42.960
your own. Eventually, you know, there is no collective salvation. Ultimately, it is being

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:47.160
promised, but it's poisonous, I think.

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:52.600
And it's, that's why we're all on this. And again, it's an irony to talk about the self,

01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:56.520
the ego as an illusion, but at the same time, say, look, we're all on this adventure in

01:21:56.520 --> 01:22:01.720
a very individualistic way. Look, the world's filled with interesting contradictions. I

01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:10.800
think this is just another one of them because, well, like I said, it was that, that's that

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:14.560
whole hero's adventure, but I was going to go somewhere else with that. And then I sort

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:19.040
of got distracted, but maybe to come back to me in a second.

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:24.200
Yeah, voluntary tribalism. You know, we would come together for a lot of different things

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:29.760
and we have great times doing that. You know, at the dinner party, we're a tribe. We got

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:34.680
around because of food and good conversation. And then we go to music festival. We are a

01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:39.360
new tribe with a bunch of other people. The problem is you, like in my case, you're born

01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:43.800
into a religion called Islam. And then they tell you all throughout your school that if

01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:48.160
you leave this religion, it's punishable by death. So you might as well just, you know,

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:53.760
just submit and do all these other things that we're asking you to do, which is very

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:58.360
aligned with where these leftists are, Marxists are coming from. And, you know, interestingly

01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:03.520
enough before the Iranian revolution, Marxists and Islamists, they had made an alliance against

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:08.680
the Shah of Iran, who they consider to be puppet of United States. So totalitarians

01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:17.880
are always aligned in this pursuit of forced collectivism, forced tribalism based on some,

01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:23.080
you know, a utopian ideal that is good for the collective. And, you know, the counter

01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:27.420
to that is voluntary tribalism because I don't think we can get rid of tribalism. Tribalism

01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:33.480
has been very, very effective and useful. It still is. But so is individuality. This

01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:39.980
ability to be able to opt in and opt out at any given time, for any given reason, based

01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:45.400
on whatever kind of objective that you individually have, that you can find other people share

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:49.600
that objective with you. And when you're done with that objective, you go and, you know,

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:50.600
find your own way.

01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:55.780
And actually, that's excellent. I would probably, like from my view, I would just, we're talking

01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:59.680
about the same things using different words. I'd probably say like playful tribalism versus

01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:04.440
serious tribalism. And so when you're playful with it, you know, then you switch modes and

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:09.760
suddenly I'm a musician talking to musicians, and that's my tribe. And then maybe, you know,

01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:15.320
you switch and then, you know, within a fraction of a second, you're doing so. But it's like

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:20.560
you said, I love that idea, like, you know, voluntary tribalism, because then that puts

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:25.760
the individual and to break out of that collective. What I was gonna mention is, you know, it

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:30.320
gives you, you know, Carrie Smith, she does the podcast, I think, Unsafe Spaces.

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:33.280
Oh, yeah, I heard the name, yes, and the podcast.

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:39.680
So there's a couple things I would suggest, if you're watching this, that because she

01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:45.400
was very much into the cult, and she describes it as a cult, like the leftist cult, she adopted

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:51.920
this viewpoint, like everything is racist, everything is sexist, and just like, you know,

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:57.360
confirmation bias, she just found it, of course, because that's the way it works. And so I

01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:03.120
was talking to her, just texting or something, and I said, what could I have said to you

01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:08.360
that would have broken you out of that mindset? You know, how could I have woken you up from

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:17.120
being woke? I mean, and she was like, that's a great question, and I think she pondered

01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:23.440
on it, she never got back to me on it, because I think it's like, it's such an individual

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:30.160
process that, like, she was on her own, it was her who woke up from it. She was the one

01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:34.480
who suddenly realized that the collect, she didn't want to be part of the collective anymore,

01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:38.840
and she wanted some choice. And actually, she even kind of describes, like, you know,

01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:43.960
this idea, like, now she has tribes and stuff, but they're all, you know, very voluntary,

01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:47.360
and you're not committed, you're not signing your life away to anyone. So you can quit

01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:52.960
a tribe at any time, and it's not a lifelong, and there's no reason why you can't be part

01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:57.640
of inconsistent tribes. And so maybe, you know, A and B would never get along, but you

01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:04.240
have no problem being part of A and B. And so that's a flexibility, and I think that's

01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:10.800
really important. I would also, when I was, you know, just so many things that happened

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:17.240
last 100 years, we just, we so quickly forget. And I'm sure you're familiar with Jim Jones

01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:24.320
and Jonestown and the whole cult and the capacity of them to drink the Kool-Aid, which I really

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:27.600
don't like that expression because I don't know if you're familiar with the details,

01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:32.120
but he was literally too cheap to buy Kool-Aid. He bought Flavor-Aid, which just seems to

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:38.360
be like, look, you know, like everyone's, it's like you're doing this massive act of

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:44.240
insanity, and yet somehow you're worried about the budget. It just shows the complexity and,

01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:49.960
you know, inconsistencies in how disturbed his thinking was. But not everyone, one of

01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:53.300
the things that was super important about the documentary, even though it was horrific

01:26:53.300 --> 01:26:59.520
and it was almost a thousand people that died, not everyone did. So we can always look with

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:07.520
these massive, you know, conformity, and we find people who found themselves, you know,

01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:17.100
it was an older woman, I think, who hid under a bed and survived Jonestown. So I think that's

01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:21.840
really hopeful. And I guess that's why I'm hopeful about this. I think we're gonna find

01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:26.160
our individual, we're gonna find the importance of, I just like the way you put that. I think

01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:31.360
we're gonna find the importance of having a voluntary tribe to be able to pick and choose

01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:35.920
what tribes we are. And that really satisfies the old program. It gives it something to

01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:42.640
do. It satisfies its needs, but it doesn't create, you know, the massive collective of

01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:48.160
one single tribe that's, you know, kind of, like I said, steamrolling over everyone else.

01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:54.160
And that's when, you know, that's the real tragedy. So the 20th century was that that

01:27:54.160 --> 01:28:00.640
one tribe got so big and then it got so massive and it was capable of inflicting so much damage

01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:06.600
that we don't wanna have any one tribe get that big again. I mean, we're always, you

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:12.900
know, going around our ancestors' groups of 50 to 100 max. We're not used to these kind

01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:19.400
of, you know, millions of people being communist or millions of people being any one tribe.

01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:25.400
I mean, that's just something that our programming isn't adapted to deal with. So I do think

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:30.200
there's hope, but I do think it lies in that individuality and finding your own path, which

01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:40.040
is always difficult to do. But, you know, who is it? The mythologist Joseph Campbell

01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:48.800
said, follow your bliss. You know, that's a great pointer to finding your own path because

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:53.240
some of these paths are just dreadful. You know, I think the biggest thing I've noticed

01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:57.360
over the last 10 years, I used to go into a classroom and I'm not much of a comedian,

01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:02.000
but as a professor, you know, I do my best and I'll do weird jokes and stuff. And I used

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:08.560
to get a classroom going. I mean, we would just have fun and it was all light and playful.

01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:11.600
And I think the biggest thing I've noticed over the last 10 years is I walk into a classroom

01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:17.720
that like the energy is just, you can feel it. It's different. It's dreadful. It's like,

01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:23.240
what can we find that's wrong with everything? And I think we've done real disservice to

01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:30.480
students because, you know, that's a recipe for depression. It's a recipe for anxiety.

01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:35.600
And we shouldn't really be doing that to them. You know, I'm surprised there isn't some kind

01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:40.760
of class action lawsuit where millions of students all get together and realize that

01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:46.120
what they bought in their education at the university was not what was sold to them.

01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:50.160
And just do a massive class action lawsuit and say, we want our money back because you

01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:54.520
said you were going to, you know, you said you were going to teach sociology and, you

01:29:54.520 --> 01:30:02.080
know, I came out a Marxist. I mean, you know, so, and that may happen. I've kind of been

01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:04.680
waiting around and I'm just surprised it hasn't already.

01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:12.400
Well, I think we're getting to something similar to that. Because one of the reasons that this

01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:18.800
Virginia election went the way it did was because the Democrat, McAuliffe, he said parents

01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:26.520
shouldn't tell school what to teach to their children. And that was the point that everything

01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:30.760
began to shift because people are like, and you know, this is not something that is limited

01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:37.080
to that race. This is a motto of that movement. Washington Post came out a couple of days

01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:42.480
after that saying parents claim they have the right to shape their kids' school curriculum.

01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:49.440
They don't. I'm like, what? So for a lot of people, I think, because, you know, the result

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:54.360
in Virginia couldn't have happened only with Republican votes. It must, they must have

01:30:54.360 --> 01:31:01.840
include some Democrats and many independents going and voting for this Republican governor

01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:04.840
because there are more. It's like by, by a million, I think that there's a difference

01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:10.600
between registered Democrats in Virginia, but people, you know, when it gets to their

01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:17.160
pockets and it gets to their children, it must be some kind of a, you know, organic

01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:22.640
evolutionary thing that you forget everything else. And this is the most important thing.

01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:26.200
And that is exactly why the left is targeting your money and your children. Because if you

01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:30.440
don't have money, you don't have choice. If you're giving up your children at age three

01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:36.400
or four that these people are pushing for, then, you know, there isn't that far of a

01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:42.520
difference from there to Jonestown, which I think it's also interesting to mention Jonestown

01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:48.200
as far as I know, they're blaming the dude, Jim Jones for all of it from the beginning

01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:54.200
to the end. But apparently towards the end, he was so drugged up and messed up that he

01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:58.280
wasn't really in charge of things. So there were a lot of women within that group that

01:31:58.280 --> 01:32:03.640
carry on with, you know, all the operation and all the ideas and all those things, which,

01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:07.600
you know, again, there are leaders who are pushing this kind of thing, but there are

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:13.480
millions of people who are empowering it. When they're giving you a snitch line to snitch

01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:18.120
on your neighbor, for example, in Los Angeles, if they're having party, call the mayor's

01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:23.720
office so they shut down their electricity and their water, their hydro stuff. And a

01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:27.880
lot of people are doing it. And I totally believe it because they used to do that in

01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:34.600
Iran all the time, just because it would look good and good students from the perspective

01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:37.400
of the government, from the perspective of the authority.

01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:44.400
Yeah. I think, like you said a little earlier, that, you know, we have a, it's close to saying

01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:47.320
we have a martial arts, we say, you know, everyone has a theory till they get punched

01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:48.320
in the face.

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:49.320
Exactly.

01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:54.680
We've got all these, you know, political ideologies and stuff, but when it starts hitting, you

01:32:54.680 --> 01:33:00.840
know, the family, when it starts hitting, you know, hitting us and things that we really

01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:07.240
hold dear, I mean, then you see this with the parents, they stepped in and, you know,

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:11.440
have been extremely vocal about critical race theory and what and I think even if people

01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:18.120
are not familiar with the Jane Elliot studies, they know how susceptible kids are to being

01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:23.000
taught political philosophies and particularly when the other side isn't being taught. You

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:27.800
know, I don't have any problem with any kind of political philosophy at the university

01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:30.880
as long as both sides of the issue.

01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:34.640
And just to give you one other example, back when I was in psych, there was a bunch of

01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:40.520
students out and they were, you know, at a booth and they were advocating the, or not

01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:48.320
advocating, they were criticizing the gender pay gap and, you know, the whole 30 cents

01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:53.560
that women make or 70 cents on the dollar that men make a dollar for or something like

01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:57.560
that. And I'm like, okay, you know, everyone knows that wage gap debate that's been around

01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:03.440
forever, like 30 years. And I said, okay, well, that's fine. But what about the death

01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:08.640
gap? And they just looked at me and like, what do you mean the death gap? And so what

01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:12.720
about the homeless gap? And they're like, what are you even talking about? I'm like,

01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:20.680
well, you realize that like men not only die sooner, but the suicide rate is like astronomically

01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:26.360
higher among men than it is with women. The homelessness rate with men is...so I was just

01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:30.240
giving them the counterargument. That's all I was doing. I was like, okay, would you rather

01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:34.080
die soon or make a little bit more money? And that's assuming that, you know, the gender

01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:39.580
pay gap was valid to begin with. But that's the point of debate. And they never heard

01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:43.540
the idea, so they were able to reject it. The first time they heard it is when I told

01:34:43.540 --> 01:34:47.480
it to them. Like, they never even heard of the death gap. I'm like, how could you go

01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:52.160
through a gender studies class and come out thinking that, you know, you want to be an

01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:56.380
advocate for social change? Well, how can you be an advocate for social change when

01:34:56.380 --> 01:35:00.800
you're hearing one side of the story? Like, what makes you think, you know, why are you

01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:07.280
going to be able to change things when you've only heard part of the debate? It amazes me.

01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:11.440
Well, there's a wonderful line from Robert...I don't know if we're getting close to the end.

01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:15.480
I like to leave it at an optimistic place, but this is a little bit dark. But I think

01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:22.000
it's actually a good...it has a positive ending to it. And one of Robert Oppenheimer's, you

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:29.600
know, famous, you know, nukes and all this stuff, but one of his...my favorite quotes

01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:35.040
of his, he said, look, it's absolutely obvious the world is going to hell. The only chance

01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:41.260
we have of ever stopping this is to stop trying to stop it. And, you know, and it was such

01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:46.000
a great thing that Alan Watts used to talk about all the time and that he would say,

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:50.440
you know, and that's why Alan Watts, maybe that's why he's coming back into popularity

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:56.400
because he said, look, all these self-helpers, they're just troublemakers. They're people

01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:03.120
with egos and they think they know what they're doing. But, you know, why? It's a terribly

01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:07.480
egotistical thing. If you want to go out and change the world, first, sit back and think

01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:13.040
why you think you have the wisdom to change it in the right direction. And he even quoted

01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:18.480
Confucius, which I've never found the original quote on this. So, you know, fact check that,

01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:23.040
I don't know. But he was quoting Confucius and he said, and he was translating it and

01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:27.160
he said, and I'm just trying to give a feel for this is just back in the 60s he was talking

01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:32.480
about this. But he said, the goody-goodies are the troublemakers of the world. And he

01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:36.920
was trying to point out that like, you know, and almost in this Jungian sense, that if

01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:42.320
I have a bright persona, I end up having a very dark shadow. So all these advocates for

01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:48.080
like, let's all make the world a better place. There's such a long history of those being

01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:54.020
the real troublemakers that, you know, I think we need to be really careful who's stepping

01:36:54.020 --> 01:37:01.600
up saying, you know, just trust me on this. I'll change the world and I've got a plan

01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:07.000
and just kind of close your eyes and just hope it all works out. And I just think we

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:13.080
have to be, you know, the social activism movement has to pause for a little bit, do

01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:16.920
some self-reflection and ask a really simple question like, what makes me think I've got

01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:24.960
the answers? You know, these are complex problems and it's so rare for us to have such nice,

01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:29.880
clear insights into even simple things in our own life, let alone thinking like, look,

01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:42.840
I can fix racism by introducing critical race theory. Do you know that? I mean, what makes

01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:47.560
you so absolutely, because again, if you're not gonna consider the other side of the debate

01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:52.480
and say, well, okay, well maybe critical race theory is gonna make us actually more racist.

01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:58.980
If you don't even consider that, then, you know, why are you in charge? Why did you step

01:37:58.980 --> 01:38:04.800
up and start telling people what to do? And this is the reason that they don't want to

01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:09.660
train thinkers. They want to train activists and they want to get to your children as soon

01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:15.840
as they can. So that will become the de facto default state of the world. It's just so obvious.

01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:22.960
It's just that more people seem to be waking up to it because, you know, when you go in

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:29.680
United States to buy something and you can't find it on the shelf and you see that people

01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:34.560
who run this country are telling you, actually, the problem is that you expecting too much.

01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:43.120
So lower your expectation. Then, you know, along with your kid coming home and ask you,

01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:48.720
am I evil because I'm white? You know, this is just not a good combination to happen to

01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:52.320
anybody, especially people who've been living here. And, you know, Americans are, you guys

01:38:52.320 --> 01:39:00.080
are like super nice and super generous, but unbelievably majority of Americans ignorant

01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:07.520
of the potential and capacity of evil. That how much worse this whole thing can get if

01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:13.720
you just allow these people who are nothing but totalitarians. That's what they are. They're

01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:18.260
totalitarians. They don't want any argument. They want submission and they're using ethics

01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:25.920
and morality and we are in this place, you know, for better or worse as a result of enlightenment.

01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:33.080
That that gotten rid of that centralized supreme authority in the form of God as interpreted

01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:37.880
by religions that I don't apply to that. But at the same time, I don't consider myself

01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:43.920
being an atheist. I think that concept of the divine divinity has been hijacked by other

01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:51.480
totalitarians who are, you know, priests and bishops and all those people. And, you know,

01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:56.240
once you got rid of that centralized authority, it brought with it a lot of good, but at the

01:39:56.240 --> 01:40:03.860
same time, it replaced academia and professors with churches and priests. And that's where

01:40:03.860 --> 01:40:07.740
we are and it cannot go on any longer, you know, because this idea of equity at some

01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:11.760
point it will get to genetics and they will like, Oh, actually, we know that we are unequal

01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:17.400
at the genetic level. So we have all the rights to alter the genetic of all the white babies

01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:21.920
to be to create, you know, this is not science fiction. This can happen within the next five

01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:28.680
to 10 years if we don't stop this insanity where it's headed. But I, you know, fortunately,

01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:33.280
I see that more people are waking up yet. This does not mean that everything is going

01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:39.040
to be great because this can also lead to somewhere even darker than where we are right

01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:41.920
now. We just don't know.

01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:47.560
Now, you reminded me of another lecture that Alan Watts had where it was just brilliant.

01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:51.960
He said, and it would have fit so well in terms of like the real power of diversity

01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:57.520
because he was on a genetics committee and they were asking like, you know, what kind

01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:01.520
of variables should we consider? And he brought up a really important point to begin with.

01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:05.960
He said, look, we're, how do us who are genetically inferior even make a decision about what genetics

01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:10.600
superiority even is? We're not in that kind of position. But then he gave, I think, some

01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:14.040
of the best advice. He said, whatever you do genetically, make sure you have a vast

01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:19.440
diversity because you never know what we're going to deal with. And so, you know, some

01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:23.320
of the activists might say, well, hey, we can get rid of toxic masculinity and we can

01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:28.760
go in and we can create males that are not completely non-aggressive. And you say, well,

01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:33.280
that's a great idea. And then the aliens attack and then you're kind of like, where are those,

01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:37.760
you know, men are just going to go out and not even care, you know, just fight like heroes

01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:44.360
and they're gone because we think we can predict the future and it's very difficult.

01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:48.160
So I like that idea. You know, whatever we do genetically, let's not, because we may

01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:54.520
need introverts or we may need extroverts and we may need, you know, for all we know,

01:41:54.520 --> 01:42:00.040
we may need, you know, drunken, you know, people we might think, well, if we could just

01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:04.920
get rid of these, you know, certain types, the world would be a better place. And you

01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:09.360
don't realize how complex systems are balanced out and you can't just take one little thread

01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:15.800
and pull on it and not affect the whole thing. And so those are dangerous systems to mess

01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:21.960
with. I hope we don't because I don't think we have the wisdom to deal with that type

01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:22.960
of complexity.

01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:26.280
Yeah. We don't know where we were. We don't know where we are. We don't know where we're

01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:31.880
going and neither does anyone else.

01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:35.120
That's the wisdom. You know, a lot of spiritual teachers say that wisdom begins with the I

01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:42.280
don't know mind and I really like that because that stops a lot of activism in their tracks

01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:47.760
because they'll, you know, so much, not all, but some activism starts off with this, like

01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:52.500
I know, I have this moral circuit and I know exactly in the same way that people burned

01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:57.120
witches knowing that that person was a witch and the inquisition and, you know, we can

01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:01.240
go through so much of human history where people, absolute, these people didn't stay

01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:08.000
awake at night regretting what they did. They went to sleep, you know, absolutely confident

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:14.920
that they were virtuous and so we have a long human history. But you're right about, you

01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:19.980
know, how easy it is to forget about the last century and how it doesn't seem like we're

01:43:19.980 --> 01:43:26.760
really getting a very good education and I'll ask students about, you know, some dictate

01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:32.840
something that happened, you know, one of the great bloody wars and no one knows anything

01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:37.760
about it. I mean, they can't even name like, I mean, people know about Hitler and people

01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:44.840
and, you know, they could talk a little bit about Mousetongue or, you know, some of these

01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:51.400
other Stalin, I mean, they really don't know the stories of the number of people and so

01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:57.040
many people died and they don't even have accurate estimates. I mean, there's so many,

01:43:57.040 --> 01:44:01.560
you know, in the millions that it's very difficult to calculate and that could be really important

01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:08.560
for us to digest and because what it shows, I think, is that, I mean, this is like a very,

01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:15.620
this program for violence and this program for conformity and the conformity, the power

01:44:15.620 --> 01:44:21.960
of us to inflict pain on the outgroup in the name of being virtuous is actually remarkable.

01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:28.600
We have a long human history of doing this and it might be time and it could be where

01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:38.480
we simply recognize the program for what it is and maybe there's hope. I don't know.

01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:46.120
I was going to ask you to give a message to the world to end the podcast, but I think

01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:52.440
you already did. So I think this is a good place to end it. You said, I hope, I don't

01:44:52.440 --> 01:45:00.520
know. Perfect. I think it is, you know, hope is, there's one of my old favorite movies,

01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:05.600
Shawshank Redemption, he gives a little speech about hope is the best of things and nothing

01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:11.520
good ever dies and I just, I think it's important. We haven't had enough hope, you know. I mean,

01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:17.440
there hasn't been that person who stood up and gave us a great speech to kind of act

01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:22.320
was we have hope programs too and those hope programs got us through a lot of rough times

01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:30.880
but we haven't had that person who got up and gave that speech that turned it on and

01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:36.800
just kind of brought it back to life. So we felt hopeful again because, you know, Nietzsche,

01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:42.680
when he wrote, when Victor Franco wrote Man's Search for Meaning, he opens it, you know,

01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:47.800
about all the concentration camps, his survival and all the suffering, but he opens it up

01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:52.760
with a quote by Nietzsche who said, he said, you know, if you have a why, you can deal

01:45:52.760 --> 01:46:02.560
with any how and, you know, but that's, it's real close, you know, that purpose, the meaning,

01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:32.480
the hope, those things could get us through this, you know, it's possible.
