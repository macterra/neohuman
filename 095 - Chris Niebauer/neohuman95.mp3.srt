1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
I guess that's why I'm hopeful about this. I think we're gonna find the importance of

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,140
– I just like the way you put that. I think we're gonna find the importance of having

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:14,600
a voluntary tribe to be able to pick and choose what tribes we are. And that really satisfies

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:20,640
the old program. It gives it something to do. It satisfies its needs. But it doesn't

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,840
create, you know, the massive collective of one single tribe that's, you know, kind of,

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:34,720
like I said, steamrolling over everyone else. And that's the real tragedy of the 20th century

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:41,120
was that that one tribe got so big and then it got so massive and it was capable of inflicting

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:53,400
so much damage that we don't want to have any one tribe get that big again.

9
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,960
Chris Nebar, welcome back to the New Human Podcast, this time the 95th episode.

10
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:04,440
Hey, so great to be here. First, let me start off. Thank you so much for copying the book.

11
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,440
Yeah, absolutely.

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:12,840
It's really awesome. You really need to have in paperback. It feels good. The art is amazing.

13
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,120
So this is such a – so cool to be part of that. I really enjoyed it.

14
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:24,040
Yeah, Chris was nice enough to write a foreword for my first book, which is a poetry book.

15
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:32,200
And I also work with a great Japanese artist, Takamoto Mamiko. So yeah, I appreciate you

16
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,800
promoting the book. Let me promote your book, Chris Nebar's book that basically brought

17
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,880
us together, No Self, No Problem, How Neuro-Psychology is Catching Up to Buddhism. And I remember

18
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,840
you were saying that you're working also on a new book, right?

19
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,400
It's a collection of exercises, because one of the things in the first book people realize

20
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,640
is like, you can't think your way out of a thinking problem. So I don't want to just

21
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,760
take a bunch of thoughts and philosophy and expect that to really transform people. So

22
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,920
we switch things around. It's just exercise after exercise. Some of them seem silly almost

23
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:14,600
to the thinking mind, but they're all trying to get us out of – I don't say get us out

24
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,040
of thinking mind, but put the thinking mind in its proper place. It's a useful tool.

25
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,880
We wouldn't want to get rid of it. It helps me remember where I left my keys. It helps

26
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:30,280
me solve problems. But you probably only need it maybe a couple hours a day at best. And

27
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,620
the problem is most people, they don't have an off switch. So they're sleeping – trying

28
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,760
to get to sleep. And unfortunately, that program is still going.

29
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,960
And so this one – so not only does it focus on the exercises, but it takes us a little

30
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:49,400
further back. What was the origins of mind? Did it just turn on 200 years ago? And I started

31
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,040
doing some really deep work in anthropology and discovered some very fascinating things

32
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,280
about our species. And so it takes us all the way back 200 – 2 million years ago when

33
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,440
human beings showed up on the scene. And then it takes us through when Homo sapiens showed

34
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,280
up. And a lot of the theory is around what happened to us as Homo sapiens. So a lot of

35
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,240
us don't realize that there were eight different types of humans on the planet. And that was

36
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:23,040
really just up until like Homo erectus was on the planet for 2 million years. Homo sapiens,

37
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,460
we just came along like 200,000 years ago. So we just got here. And then this wild thing

38
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:34,320
happened where we just dominated, completely took over the whole planet, exterminated possibly

39
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,680
except there's other theories. But we may have just terminated all the different forms

40
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:45,640
of humanity. And now we're left. And so the theory tries to suggest that the reason

41
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:51,120
we were so successful is because the way the mind works. And the mind was good at strategizing,

42
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,200
it's good at categorization, some of the stuff I'm sure we'll talk about today.

43
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,880
But those were all super advantages in terms of our species. These other – the Homo erectus

44
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,160
may have been able to think and reason a little bit, but they didn't have the tools that

45
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,840
we had in terms of creating groups, in-group and out-groups. And so even though we were

46
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,560
physically smaller, you know, let's say than Neanderthal, but it didn't matter because

47
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,600
if you get 10 of us working together as a group, we'll still be able to take out that

48
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:28,200
one much larger individual. And so it tries to give people a backstory on this thinking

49
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:35,080
point. Where did it come from? Why is it so hard to turn off, you know? And it's trying

50
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,360
to solve problems like – it's trying to solve problems that we had 100,000 years ago.

51
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:47,560
So it's dealing with, you know, glaciers and food supply and, you know, extreme changes

52
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,120
in temperature. And now all of a sudden we're in a place like – we created a world that

53
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,960
has almost no temperature change at all with air conditioning and heat. Most of us, many

54
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:03,240
of us, live between like, you know, 68 and 72 degrees or something. And so what does

55
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:09,760
the mind have to do? You know, what does it have to do? And so what it does is it still

56
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:15,080
finds its meaning in finding problems. So it is out there when it can't find a problem,

57
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,040
it creates one. In fact, I'll send you another link. It's maybe one of the most important

58
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,680
papers. I don't know if you've seen it or maybe we've talked about it, but it demonstrated

59
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:30,520
this so beautifully, experimentally, that the mind is just creating problems. And it

60
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:37,160
will redefine what a problem is if its first problem changes or say you solve the first

61
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,560
problem. It will redefine the problem so it continuously has something to do. And so they

62
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,800
gave subjects a task. Just hit a key every time a blue dot comes up. And it was blue

63
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,740
dots and they would go all the way from blue to purple. And eventually they just stopped

64
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,320
showing blue dots. And you'd think, well, the subject should just stop responding. You

65
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,800
know, here's my target. It's not there anymore. I stopped responding. But they didn't. They

66
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,920
changed the definition of blue. So they started responding to purple dots. And that's kind

67
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,320
of cool. But the next two studies, really, it's worth just giving you a short description

68
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:16,520
of because it's going to be relevant to, I think, our whole discussion. But in another

69
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:23,560
study, what they had is bright faces that look threatening. So they're a really threatening

70
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,200
face. But then it really went all the way to like a neutral or maybe completely non-threatening

71
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,440
face. But the first task was hit a key every time you see a threatening, this particular

72
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,360
threatening face. And then just like before, they stopped showing threatening faces. And

73
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,560
again, people didn't stop responding. They just changed what a threatening face is. So

74
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,280
suddenly this face that's neutral, now they think that that's a threat. And the last one,

75
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,500
I think, again, maybe that was the most relevant one to some of the stuff we're dealing with.

76
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,880
They said, pick, so you're going to be a researcher and you're evaluating the ethics on this research

77
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,680
proposal. And they would throw in huge ethical flaws. And your task is to catch the ethical

78
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,720
flaw. And so, of course, everyone was pretty good at this. Then they removed the ethical

79
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,640
flaws. And again, instead of not responding anymore, like, hey, problem solved, people

80
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:16,520
changed the definition of what an ethical problem is. And they would continuously.

81
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,920
And here's the most beautiful part about this study. They went and told people, like, look,

82
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:27,600
we're going to stop the problem. We're going to stop showing you the target. Had no effect.

83
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,880
Then they paid people to be correct. So you think, look, I'm going to get paid if I'm

84
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:40,120
just accurate. Had no effect on performance. It's so set on redefining what a problem is

85
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,560
that and I think that's one of the things we're dealing with right now.

86
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,560
So many of our problems that our mind, the thinking mind evolved to solve, they're gone.

87
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,760
So now we find, like, oh, it's, you know, 68 degrees, I'm freezing. And that becomes

88
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:02,280
a problem. Or it's 74 or 75 and I'm, you know, too hot. And so all these things they're

89
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,720
dealing with in society, these amazing complaints that were just like, where did that stuff

90
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,800
come from? So many things in office politics. I mean, so much of the conflict that's going

91
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,840
on right now, you could almost say, how much of the conflict going on is just people finding

92
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:22,320
problems? Because that seems to be what the mind does. And it does. And it does so even

93
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,000
when there isn't a problem to be solved.

94
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:35,800
So this mentality of oppressed versus the oppressor that Marxism kind of capitalized

95
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:41,120
on it, you know, by not creating it maybe, but by recognizing that this is something

96
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,280
that is deeply embedded within humanity. And now it's been incentivized that, you know,

97
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,680
now it's changing a little bit because I think people have begun seeing right through it.

98
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:59,960
But for a long time, it was incentivized that if you're a victim, you're the special one.

99
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:06,480
And so, for example, let's say within this context of critical race theory that we're

100
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:13,480
going to talk about, all it is, is that if you're white, you are taking advantage of

101
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,600
this privilege that has been given to you by other white people who, by the way, screwed

102
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,800
over everyone else for you as a white person to have this privilege. So if you're born

103
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:32,280
white, not only you cannot not be an oppressor, you can't also recognize that, yes, I could

104
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,880
have some privileges, but I don't really see races. I see just different people with...

105
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,120
No, no, no, no, no, you can't be doing that either. You have to be actively anti-racist.

106
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,360
And they define what is anti-racism, which includes, you know, you buying books, a bunch

107
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:53,760
of people who are getting paid like $20,000, $25,000 an hour just to give Zoom talks, just

108
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,440
so people feel like, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, we're on the part of the oppressed.

109
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,440
So...

110
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,720
It's a beautiful Freudian trick. Freud did the same thing. He said, look, you know, you

111
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,400
hate your parents and it's unconscious. And one or two things happened. You know, you'd

112
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,120
either agree with them, say, you're right, I hate my parents, or you wouldn't. And then

113
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,840
he's still right because it's just unconscious. And there's no way the person can win. So

114
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:23,040
anything you do, it's like it philosophically puts you into a corner where you can't win.

115
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:29,440
So you either admit that you're the oppressor or by definition, you're like, you don't see

116
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
it as a problem.

117
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,720
Well, you don't see it that you're an oppressor, but you're still an oppressor. Yeah.

118
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,720
Yeah. And it's impossible. There's literally nothing. So there's... And again, maybe this

119
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,800
has been one of the hallmarks of history. We put people into certain categories based

120
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:51,200
on physical characteristics and we back them into these corners where there's really nothing

121
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,360
they can do, you know, except admit that this group is right. I mean, it ends up being their

122
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
only choice.

123
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:04,320
Yeah. But obviously it's bogus in the context of, for example, critical race theory, because

124
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:12,160
what it is is that it's a form of racism that justifies itself because it's fighting a different

125
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,660
kind of racism. But they're saying that this is actually not racism to be racist against

126
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,360
white people because white people have been in power for a very long time. So it's okay

127
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,440
if they get screwed over for the sake of other people. But you see that even that, they're

128
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,560
not staying true to that because for... Kanye West came out to support Trump. Everybody

129
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,040
came down at him that, oh, he's white supremacist. He's a wrong kind of black. There are plenty

130
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,480
of black people who are on the right, who are not going along with what's going on.

131
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,600
A very good example of what happened yesterday in Virginia that, you know, a bunch of people

132
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,280
on MSNBC and CNN were talking about, oh, this is a result of racism that people have voted

133
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:57,360
for this conservative for the Republican Party by margin of a lot, you know, because Biden

134
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,880
won Virginia by I think around 10 points. And this shift has been enormous. But they're

135
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:10,200
not even mentioning that Virginia also elected their first black female lieutenant governor.

136
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:17,400
And how is this going to be aligned with this idea that they're promoting that no, all the

137
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,960
white people are against all the black people and all the black people are basically the

138
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:29,360
oppressed who have absolutely no ability to do anything other than just being in this

139
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:36,360
line that we're drawing with the leadership of absolute minority of people, most of whom

140
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:44,000
are coming from academia, right? All this academic theory that they've forced upon people

141
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,720
as some kind of social experiments that they're saying, hey, just believe what we are saying.

142
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,400
This is a new form of religion. Just believe in the greater good, the good end, the utopia

143
00:12:53,400 --> 00:13:00,040
that we are drawing. And, you know, everything, everything else basically justifies this end.

144
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:06,880
And there's a couple things going on there. I think cognitive science offers actually

145
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:14,260
some help in this area because we know confirmation bias is probably one of the biggest faults

146
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:19,240
of the way we think. You know, we set out to prove we're right. And, of course, that's

147
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,560
what Freud did. And if you're really good at proving you're right, that's when you're

148
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,600
clever enough to back people into a corner and they can't do anything. And so, again,

149
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,040
when you just think about, like, what do you type? What are you typing? What are you looking

150
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,760
at? And, of course, there's algorithms that if you're only looking to confirm what you

151
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,320
already know, then a computer is going to help you so much with that. All these search

152
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,360
engines are going to look, they're going to so support this because then you're just going

153
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,420
to find more and more evidence of exactly what you know. And, of course, if that's happening

154
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,880
with the media, that's a problem too. But we also have really smart people like Steven

155
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,980
Pinker goes around. I mean, he wrote that book Enlightenment Now to show that we really

156
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,760
have it amazingly good right now. But I also love one of his other lines that almost seemed

157
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,560
like it took me back to third grade, but we need a reminder of it. And he said, you cannot

158
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,880
make accurate judgments about the individual based on their group membership. And it's

159
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:17,240
like, well, yeah, I know that. But we all seem like we should know that. But somehow

160
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:23,980
we threw that philosophy, we threw that piece of advice, or I would say that piece of fact,

161
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,480
we just threw it out the window. And now we're back to saying, if I know your group membership,

162
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,680
I know something about you. But the problem is, we know from research and statistics,

163
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,840
I mean, no, you cannot make, I mean, that's the whole thing about when you look at the

164
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:42,080
normal curve, it shows that here's a bunch of average people. But, you know, half of

165
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:47,300
them will be on the right, nor they're on the other. This is the abstract way of describing

166
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:52,520
a group. And there's tons of variability within that group. And what we're finding out, I

167
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,240
think, one of the major lessons that we will eventually find out, although I think maybe

168
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,160
Jordan Peterson may have said this too, already, that what we're going to find out is that

169
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:06,760
there's far more variability within these groups than there are between them. And so

170
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:11,320
simply by categorizing people white and black, well, what if there's more variability within

171
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,760
each of those groups? Then it makes absolutely no sense to use the categorical division in

172
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,440
the first place. And we need to move on to something that, unfortunately, is more complex.

173
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,840
The thinking mind does not want to work. It's lazy. It loves cartoon-like versions of reality

174
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:34,160
that are just easy to assimilate. And so when we tell people things like, you know, well,

175
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,600
here's group A and group B, and they have these different characteristics. Oh, you know,

176
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,320
someone from group B? Well, then this is one thing you can conclude about them. I mean,

177
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,760
it's really a cartoon-like version of reality, but the mind buys into it because it loves

178
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:55,640
simple stories like that, simple narratives. And we become victims of, like, just falling

179
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:02,920
prey to really simple stories that the mind is very, I mean, that's the way it worked.

180
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:11,440
I mean, back, so the theory that I've been working on is, again, a story about our history

181
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,240
as a species and how is it that human beings came on the planet about two and a half million

182
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,800
years ago, and then all of a sudden we had all kinds of different, you know, Homo erectus,

183
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,960
Nandrothal, and we had all these different, maybe eight, although they probably end up

184
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,320
going to get to, like, 12. Who knows how many? They keep finding different versions when they

185
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,320
find artifacts.

186
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,320
Of humans.

187
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:38,160
And these are human beings. These are human beings. But we have slight differences. And

188
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,760
again, Homo sapiens, our version, popped up on the scene only 200,000 years ago, and we

189
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:49,040
were smaller, we were not physically dominant, but we had this gift, this kind of mental

190
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,720
trick, this kind of mind hack of categorizing. And it's not that other species couldn't

191
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,560
do this, but I think we just did it so effortlessly. It just came so easy. And one of the things

192
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:06,000
that I think we're going to realize is that categorization is absolutely an illusion.

193
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,480
It's the same, like, when people ask me, look, what do you mean by Maya? You know, this illusory

194
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:20,040
male that prevents us from seeing the real world. And the thing I would point to is categorization.

195
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,240
And categorization, again, well, what do we do with categorization? We take a bunch of

196
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,160
individual differences, tons of variability. That's the way nature is. It's all messy.

197
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,560
And then the mind will focus on one quality that all these very different things have

198
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:39,240
in common, ignores everything else, ignores all the differences, the vast differences

199
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,260
in all these individuals. And so we could say, like, that's ignorance. It's like ignorance.

200
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,760
You just have to completely ignore all that. But they say, well, they all have this one

201
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:55,660
thing in common. And again, whether it's skin color, gender, that's whatever, identity politics.

202
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:00,400
You're taking people who have one thing in common and you're grouping them and then believing

203
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:08,560
that it's possible to know that group. And you can't. I mean, there are a bunch of individuals

204
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:13,920
who vary all over the place. It's super. And what it is, these averages that we talk about

205
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,240
when we look at groups, they're statistical averages that are just, they exist in the

206
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:24,520
world of abstractions. They're not, you can't go out and see these groups. Like, you might

207
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:29,280
be saying, well, I can see an example of a white person. Well, can you really see whiteness?

208
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:37,360
Can you see, you know, the race? And you can't. You can't because it's something that we've

209
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:44,880
made up. And I think we're going to eventually start feeling that a little bit more deep.

210
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:51,520
And you can see that some of the political stuff we're dealing with here is an argument

211
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:58,240
between group identities. And I think identity politics is exactly that. It's simplifying

212
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,440
people based on very trivial characteristics and, you know, race and gender. The irony

213
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,480
of this is when you get into spiritual practices, like a lot of different forms of meditation,

214
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:15,200
you start the meditation off saying, I'm not my body. I mean, you're starting off like

215
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:24,160
with this acknowledgement, like my true self has nothing to do with this physical body.

216
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:30,160
And yet we seem to take some of these really trivial qualities and we categorize them and

217
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,280
then believe we can know something about a person based on that.

218
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:39,360
Yeah, but, you know, even the term we, when you say we, there is no such a thing as we.

219
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,720
No, there isn't. It's all useful, somewhat useful abstractions, but I think they are

220
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,160
getting us into trouble more than they should. You're right.

221
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:52,240
Yeah, we all use it. You know, again, see, I'm saying we all use it. I'm sure there's

222
00:19:52,240 --> 00:20:00,440
some people who don't use it, but it also shows the limits of language and how limited

223
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:09,920
everything man-made is towards that objective reality. And I think this is a very important

224
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:16,320
difference to understand that yes, the conflict of humanity seemed to have been around this

225
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:23,760
dilemma of individuality and group, tribes basically. And for a longest time, it obviously

226
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,960
made sense for people to be in groups because there were other groups of people. And if

227
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,520
you were not in a group, you would be just decimated. You would be annihilated by that

228
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:38,280
group of people. But we became more secure in the case of our survival. You know, we

229
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:45,840
are not bound to go and find any kind of a food today because there might not be food

230
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,760
for the next five days, right? So we have the option to go to different grocery stores

231
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:59,520
to find different items up to our likings, which is customized. So let's say that shopper

232
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,120
be placed in a group. Yes, it can be placed in a group of shoppers, people who go out

233
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:09,160
and shop. But you cannot pin it down that there's a group of people who go, you know,

234
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:15,160
this percentage to like Publix, this percentage to Walgreens, this percentage to Walmart.

235
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:22,120
People have this freedom and autonomy to make different choices, right? But it seems like

236
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:31,080
because this structure called society is also manmade, this is not an objective reality.

237
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:39,200
We have assembled this construct and all the tools within it, including ethics and morality

238
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:46,120
to get from point A to point B. And that point B has always been determined based on the

239
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,260
need that we've had in order to survive. I don't think people have come together most

240
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:58,080
in most of history to build something necessarily. They've come together to build something against

241
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,340
something or someone else. There's always been a threat for people to come together

242
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:08,620
and build like a, you know, I would argue it's always been about tools. You just build

243
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:14,440
a more capable, more complex, more sophisticated tool, own the other group, and then the other

244
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:19,480
group, whatever remains of it, notice what you've done, improve upon that tool. And,

245
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:26,720
you know, we have evolved in the way that our tools have surpassed our level of comprehension.

246
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:34,440
And now we are, you know, we are really addressing the core of exactly what is it that when we

247
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:43,880
say we, what do we mean? What are the elements that we have in, you know, we share as a collective

248
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:49,600
of humanity? And I think this is that point, which is the point of philosophy, really.

249
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,920
Yeah, I think we talked about the beginning of that movie, 2001, A Space Odyssey, where,

250
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,360
you know, that moment, that first thought, and one of our ancestors like, well, this

251
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:05,040
is a bone, but I can use it as a weapon. So we started thinking in ways that we could

252
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,600
use things for what they're not. And then he throws that bone into space, and it becomes,

253
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,880
you know, a space shuttle or something. And you're like, wow, you know, it's the same,

254
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,060
the trick is like, it's the same thing that we're thinking 70,000 years ago, that's responsible

255
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:25,040
for all the technology that we have now. And it's all tool building. And it's, you know,

256
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:29,920
and it's not a linear scale. So we were building tools, and we, you know, if you look at some

257
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:35,000
I think was Homo erectus, you know, just never accelerated with tools. They really had the

258
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,120
same tools for like 2 million years. They, I mean, have really simple things to cut with

259
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:45,600
and they never had that kind of, I need a better mousetrap kind of thing. And then we

260
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,240
of course did. And so that's why you see this, you know, this nice line where it just keeps

261
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,360
going. But then all of a sudden, all the stuff we're making now, and if you look, like the

262
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,720
basic production, like when did human production, and of course, you've got like the Industrial

263
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:05,120
Revolution, but it's the curve just goes like this for the entire human. And then all of

264
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,880
a sudden, just like in the last 100 years, it goes up like this.

265
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:13,680
Yeah, because technology, technology advances exponentially. And at that line that seemed

266
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:20,840
flat, it was never flat. You're showing you're showing a link on your screen. Oh, something

267
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:26,440
came up. Interesting. Are you send me a link? Very interesting. I never see. I just showed

268
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:32,840
it now. Weird. Anyways, we're going to show some of Chris's articles about Chris's and

269
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:40,720
all that. But yeah, that that line that seemed flat, it was never flat. It's just the difference

270
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:48,520
between each generation was, you know, you go from one to two, two to four, four to eight,

271
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:55,720
eight to 16. So it's not really, you know, visible. But at some point, you go 30 steps

272
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:03,200
exponentially, you hit billion, you know, but our experience is linear. So yes, we have,

273
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,320
we have assumed that we're using all these tools, including radio and television and

274
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:15,560
newspapers and, you know, early internet and all that, in order to pursue our, you know,

275
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:23,200
what we assume to be shared goals, right? Because when you had limited sources of interpretation

276
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,320
and distribution of information, obviously, your objectives seem to be shared among the

277
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,680
public because the options were not presented. But now for people who are willing to see

278
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:40,280
because it's terrifying, but it's also exciting and exhilarating. Somebody said on this podcast,

279
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:47,480
that's the correct term to use for how we feel in this period, that, you know, the tools

280
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:55,960
have surpassed our evolution. And so all of our values are open, open to be questioned

281
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,800
and open to be debated and challenged. And exactly because of that, I think some people

282
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:10,040
are going back to very pure tribalism based on values and cultures and religions and whatever

283
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:14,000
that they can hold on to. You know, I made this argument, I think two years ago on this

284
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,320
podcast that I think fundamentalist version of religions are going to make a comeback

285
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,400
because when everything seems so uncertain, you want to hold on to whatever that you can

286
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:31,000
find that give you sense, illusion of certainty and solidity. And then there are a group of

287
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,720
people who just want to stop all these technological advancement or like we have to put a moratorium

288
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,760
on it and we don't need this level of advancement. And, you know, the only thing I can tell those

289
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:47,280
people is that good luck with that, because our evolution has never been separated from

290
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,600
the evolution of tools and technology.

291
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:59,920
Yeah, I mean, it's interesting that, you know, if you take someone that just right now and

292
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,320
you take them into a lab and you get them to start making primitive tools, it's interesting

293
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:08,080
that the left side of the brain starts like acting up, even though they're using, you

294
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,880
know, they may can use their left hand so that would activate normally you think the

295
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,280
right side. But any kind of tool making, it just is such a primitive thing. And there's

296
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:22,000
just programs in there that are set for making these really simple things. And of course,

297
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,240
that's the same thing that goes into making computers. I mean, we're tapping into the

298
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:32,520
same element of desire, you know, and it's almost like that Buddhist thing, like, you

299
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:37,760
know, desire is the cause of suffering because, you know, it's our desire for whatever the

300
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,120
next best thing is that used to be and you're right, it was not flat, but it's nowhere near

301
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:49,440
the curve that we're dealing with now. And so things become, you know, kind of an existential,

302
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,320
you know, every phone goes by too quick and you can probably upgrade your phone every

303
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:01,080
year and maybe every six months and computers are, you know, just moving along just way

304
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:05,720
too quickly for everybody. So we've got this, again, 70,000 year old program that's living

305
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:11,320
at a pace that it was never intended to. So I think you're right. People go back to fundamentalism

306
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:20,080
because the core of fundamentalism, however it appears, is the absolute certitude in it.

307
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,520
And that simplifies everything. It just makes everything else just seem, you know, it's

308
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:30,800
a set of rules. It's like a bureaucracy that if you follow all these rules, you have guaranteed

309
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:37,680
outcomes. And so I would have to agree with you. I think that that dogma and we know what

310
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:45,160
is dogma but the inability to, you know, shutting down a question before it even comes up. And

311
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:50,560
that's what we see so often. It's a frightening thing when you get into academia and the cancel

312
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:58,840
culture and you see people, you know, stopping a debate before it even happens. And I would

313
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,240
suggest to anyone listening, really get into James Lindsay on this. He's done an outstanding

314
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:10,720
job of breaking down where all this came from, the history of it, and just reading simple

315
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,800
books to you like Mercuse, where he was able to start off and did it so clearly that says

316
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:22,800
that, look, you know, if you're on the left, absolutely everything is tolerated. Violence,

317
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:29,480
spelled out, but anything from the right has to be stopped before it even is thought. So

318
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,080
you stop it for you. You don't wait till someone talks and then censor it. You have to stop

319
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,960
it before they even have that thought.

320
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:41,080
Oh, you can't even if you're if you're coming from the left, you're not even allowed to

321
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:48,320
share a platform that is given to somebody who you would recognize or categorize as right

322
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:54,920
wing. So, you know, earlier on, I had some guests on this podcast is like five years,

323
00:29:54,920 --> 00:30:01,800
six years ago, who would associate with the left. These are like prominent leftists now.

324
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,840
And they had problems with some of the guests that I had later on. Like you have to remove

325
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,280
our episodes. I'm like, there's no way I'm going to do that. You know, it really is a

326
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,800
nonsensical problem that you do. I didn't give you any guarantee that I'm going to ask

327
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:18,360
you who I'm going to talk to. But they're like, you know, you're giving them you're giving

328
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:24,560
this argument that is toxic to our cause, air, basically, you're giving it oxygen, and

329
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,080
we're against that. Totally totalitarian.

330
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:33,160
But yeah, and if you say, well, one group gets to do whatever pre rain total, and the

331
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,920
other group gets to be shut down, then that's interesting. Then you say, Okay, well, how

332
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,320
do you know someone's on the right? Because one of the fascinating things that happens

333
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:46,520
to me as a university professor is, like, you know, I wouldn't categorize myself as

334
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:50,680
being on the left or the right, I would say I'm a complex person, my views, I don't even

335
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:57,120
buy much into the solid reality of a self to begin with. So, you know, I would say it's

336
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:03,940
a fluid thing with different thoughts. And but, but I, my perception is that I'm very

337
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:10,160
far on the right. And so when I go into the university, it's, you know, it's just assumed.

338
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:14,560
And it's interesting, too, because I get labeled being on the right, specifically because I'm

339
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,760
such an advocate for viewpoint diversity, and wanting to get discussions going. And

340
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,800
I want people to talk and debate. And I went, and I often, you know, quote, john Stuart

341
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,280
Mill and say, Look, you don't even know your own argument, unless you know the other side

342
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:31,820
of it. And that gets me all of a sudden, I got this giant conservative label on me. Right.

343
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:36,160
And so it's freaking me out. Because I'm like, so that's concerned, like, like, it's not

344
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:43,920
even I'm like, that's conservative now. Well, I'll tell you this. The African American Museum

345
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:49,220
of actually me, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, they came out

346
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:56,800
with something. Those of our viewers and listeners who watch this on YouTube, I'm showing these

347
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:02,640
screenshots, they came out with whiteness and white culture. This is like a year and

348
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,520
a half ago, I think around the George Floyd whole thing, that they point out some of the

349
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:16,200
characteristic and signs and elements of this white culture and whiteness.

350
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:22,480
Rugged individualism, emphasis on scientific method, which is in which includes objective,

351
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:28,360
rational, linear thinking, cause and effect relationship, quantitative emphasis. But it

352
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:33,600
also goes to all the way to justice based on English common law, that is whiteness,

353
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:41,040
therefore it's bad. Competition being number one, win at all costs, win or lose their diatomy,

354
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:48,480
action orientation, master and control nature, decision making, majority rules. So obviously,

355
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:54,260
there was a huge backlash against these people and they removed it from their website. Yet,

356
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:58,760
if you go to their website right now, they have the talking about race section, they

357
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:03,440
have a whiteness section, and they go all the way down, explain again and stuff. And

358
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:09,040
then the video at the end of persons talking about it is this vile racist woman, Robin

359
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:18,000
D'Angelo, the author of White Fragility, that it's not even like hidden or subtle.

360
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,460
It's that this is how it is, we are being racist against white people and that is acceptable

361
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:27,280
because white people have been empowered. And I echo what you said about James Lindsay.

362
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:32,480
Lindsay was a guest here almost a year and a half ago on this podcast and it was really

363
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:38,200
interesting because when we did the episode, few days after that, George Floyd stuff happened

364
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:43,820
and he was like, I'm just going to release this a little later. I was like, yeah, totally.

365
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:49,440
But I also had an interesting experience. I went to see the first manned launch of a

366
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:57,120
SpaceX rocket. He was a test test dragon with the very first astronauts they sent to International

367
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,940
Space Station. And it was the same day that they were burning down number of communities

368
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:11,760
all around the US. I think it was May 31, 2020. And I was thinking how America has a

369
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:17,880
choice, such a clear choice, that you have a building culture. I went to see the launch

370
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:22,520
and all that. It was like three hours drive from here. You have the building culture of

371
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:27,680
building a rocket, a reusable rocket that sent astronauts to the space station and then

372
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:32,760
come back. It's just incredible achievement. And on the other hand, you have this cancel

373
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:38,120
culture which is a destructive culture of basically we just want to remove everything

374
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:45,600
that exists as a result of this white culture or white supremacy or whatever. And we don't

375
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:50,240
know what we're going to replace it with. But we do need that a good thing to do is

376
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,060
to removing all of them. And people shouldn't put up with it for any amount of ethical and

377
00:34:55,060 --> 00:35:00,980
moral argument because it is immoral and unethical to begin with that we're going to ruin the

378
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:04,400
lives of a whole bunch of people because of the color of their skin because we have this

379
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:12,720
abstract ideal utopia that we might or might not get to it. But so no, there is no ethical

380
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,200
or moral argument whatsoever.

381
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,720
And people have to be really careful because I'm sure you're familiar with the Jane Elliott

382
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,720
experiments when she took these third graders and just said, well, people with brown eyes

383
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:30,000
are smarter than people with blue eyes. And they all just sucked right up into it. I mean,

384
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,960
they just bought into it and they were treating people horribly. And then she just went in

385
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,680
the next day and reversed it and said, no, it's actually whatever other eye colors. And

386
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,800
she switched it on them and they just followed right along. I mean, so kid, that's that old

387
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,960
program. It's so susceptible to if we hear this category and then we say, well, this

388
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:54,520
category equals bad, we have to actually become extremely conscious of how susceptible we

389
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:59,400
are to that for us to actually ever be able to overcome it.

390
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,280
Sorry, I think I lost you for a second.

391
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:09,880
Yeah, I'm here. I hear you. Yeah.

392
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:15,800
And I remember my daughter, she came home from school maybe and maybe it was around

393
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:21,720
third grade and she was all confused and she looked and she goes, dad, am I white? You

394
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:27,280
know, like it was never like, like an obvious kind of thing to her. And so I like held up

395
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,840
something like typing paper next to her skin. I'm like, do you look white? What do you think?

396
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,280
And she just kind of looked at me, she goes, well, I'm, you know, and I was like, a white

397
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:41,000
person would be kind of terrifying, right? I mean, it's like if they were like actual

398
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:48,160
the definition of white. And so it just shows you these are cartoon characters, characters

399
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:54,400
that we're dealing with. It's so absolutely obvious that they are things that are only

400
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,940
existing in our head. I mean, think about race. I mean, where is it when no one's thinking

401
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:03,400
about it? And where is it? Like there's so many places you can go. One of the reasons

402
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:09,280
I, in fact, I was just down close to you, I think in St. Petersburg a couple of months

403
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,160
ago and you can go to beaches and all this. And one of the reasons I love it is because

404
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:19,360
you see such variation in skin color and just no one doesn't. I mean, it's not recognized.

405
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:24,680
We're like, we're all just human beings hanging out at the beach. And so, but then you watch

406
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:30,200
their news channels and it looks like there's this, you know, it's like it's a war going

407
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:36,720
on. And so, so much of that is covered by the media. And then the susceptibility of

408
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,880
the mind to just fall prey to these simple categories. I mean, and we have to be very

409
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:46,400
careful what we expose kids to, too, because I think Jane Elliott, it was such a good,

410
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,140
you know, none of that would have been ethical these days to do something like that to these

411
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:56,080
kids but it just showed so explicitly our susceptibility to thinking in simplistic categories

412
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,680
and then doing really nasty stuff to people if they're in the out group. And you'd think

413
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:05,640
we would have learned that lesson. And so, anytime you refer to any category, well, you

414
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:11,240
know, whiteness or white anything or any, again, like I said, with Steven Pinker, you

415
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,580
cannot make reliable judgments about an individual based on their group membership. And if we

416
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:21,800
just got that to sink in a little and get people to work and realize that, wow, there

417
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:27,920
really is a lot of variability within these groups and that may be all it would take to

418
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,360
start breaking it down. But you're talking about an old program that's been successful

419
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:40,240
for like 70,000 years. You know, when you look at the 20th century, it was like the

420
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:46,040
bloodiest century in human history because it was able to activate this old program and

421
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:53,700
get us thinking in ways of groups, in group and out group. And, you know, you mix that

422
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:59,560
old program with technology and it becomes extremely dangerous. And so, everyone's sort

423
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,880
of waiting to see what's going to happen. I don't know if you heard about this thing,

424
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,080
maybe it was James Lindsay was talking about the, you know, the white pill or the black

425
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:15,600
pill. Right. Yeah. And so, you know, everyone's sort of like, it's such a complex system.

426
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:20,720
It's very hard to predict very complex systems like this. So we're all sort of just waiting.

427
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:25,320
And while some of us are optimistic and think maybe we'll have these insights that, you

428
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:29,940
know, races itself as a construction and the way we're defining it and we'll have these

429
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:33,840
insights that every time we solve a problem, we just find another problem because that's

430
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:40,280
what the mind will do endlessly. And then we shift, like I said, in your example, we've

431
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:45,200
got two worlds. One is a world where we complain and we're a victim and we're miserable. And

432
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,320
the other reality is we're incredibly grateful for this amazing adventure of being a conscious

433
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:56,800
being on a planet at a time that's unprecedented in all kinds of really cool stuff that we

434
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,280
could be incredibly grateful for. And all of a sudden, we get really happy and we feel

435
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,640
satisfied. And so those two worlds, as you described them, I mean, it is a choice that

436
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:12,480
we make. And some people have just such a habit. You know, that's the thing about humans

437
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,840
too, we're real susceptible to habits. So we complain, we feel miserable, but we're used

438
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:24,120
to it. And so it takes a lot of conscious effort, like breaking any habit. You know,

439
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:28,320
some people do, they put the cigarettes down, they never smoke again. But for other people,

440
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:33,040
they struggle with it. And as I talk about my mindfulness class, you know, sometimes

441
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:38,000
we're so unhappy that we feel so comfortable being unhappy that we're actually in a weird

442
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:47,120
way happy when we're unhappy. And then we get this, you know, feelings of enlightenment,

443
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:51,800
like you might think in a technical sense, but we feel like, you know, kind of wonderful.

444
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,920
We feel a little bit of joy because we start feeling grateful. But then we feel uncomfortable

445
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,040
with feeling grateful. Because now, all of a sudden, you know, we feel like, oh, this

446
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,080
is my privilege, you know, because privilege became a bad thing. It used to be something

447
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:12,440
that you were grateful for and pondered on. And it was the origins of a lot of positive

448
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:18,440
feelings. Now, all of a sudden, if I have a certain amount of things and I live in a

449
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:23,120
certain time, then all of a sudden, well, you know, things that I didn't even choose,

450
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:28,000
that I still should be so grateful for, but I didn't choose any of it. And then suddenly

451
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,040
you kind of feel like, well, maybe I shouldn't feel so good about all this. So, but I do

452
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:38,840
really think, you know, the crossroads, you know, taking the, you know, the white pill,

453
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:43,680
black pill, feeling some optimism, we really don't know where this is going to go. And

454
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:50,160
of course, as someone who's got, you know, one lawsuit that took place from 2014 to 2017

455
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:55,800
and then a second lawsuit that I'm currently in, so I'm kind of living it right at the

456
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,880
front lines, you might say, at a university where you could say, okay, you know, what's

457
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,600
Neibart doing that's so radical? Why is he this radical conservative? I mean, he writes

458
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:09,880
books on spirituality, he writes books on, you know, neuroscience and Buddhism, he's

459
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:15,160
trying to transcend this idea of a self and get people to feel a little bit more grateful.

460
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:20,480
Okay, well, that, you know, what's so like, like radically concerned? Am I so far in the

461
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,840
right now? And so it's very confusing for me to like, because I think things have shifted

462
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:33,200
so far that, well, I actually call this the Borg theory of conformity. And I know a lot

463
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,480
of people aren't familiar with the Borg, I'm a huge Star Trek fan, so I was, and I have

464
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:41,080
to explain this to my students because they're like, they have no clue because it was 90s,

465
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:47,040
you know. But the Borg was this machine, it was half machine, half humans, and it was

466
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:52,200
– they flew around in space in the cube, which I thought was interesting because, you

467
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,720
know, nature is filled with wiggles and yet the mind always tries to square off things

468
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:02,840
and create edges and stuff and flatten out the messiness of nature. So they represented

469
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:10,280
technology in its kind of most advanced form because they were able to, you know, connect

470
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,760
the organic to the computers.

471
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,320
But the most amazing thing that they predicted in the 90s is that the Borg flew around space

472
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:24,520
and had one mission, destroy individuality. I mean, that was the mission of the Borg.

473
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:29,440
They would just take up species and they would steal their technology and – but the most

474
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,320
important thing they would steal is their uniqueness as an individual and anything that

475
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:40,280
was different, anything that – it's always like this, you know, species that was – they

476
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:47,480
would even say, you know, resistance is futile. You know, you're going to basically join

477
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:54,520
us in becoming this one collective mindset. So it really, to me, if you haven't seen

478
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,960
it before, you know, I would suggest to people like just watch a couple of things, you know,

479
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:04,680
very short YouTube clips. Just type in Borg and Star Trek and you'll see how – I think

480
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:14,200
it was almost prophetic insight into where we were going in terms of this kind of mass

481
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:21,280
group, this mindset that would just kind of steamroll over things and be like, you know,

482
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:28,200
if we even have a hint that you're not conforming, then you're gone. And so – and then of

483
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:36,240
course, that was in some ways a really short version of the last century. And then of course,

484
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:41,960
it resulted in what – I mean, some estimates are up to 100 million deaths, you know. It's

485
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:48,400
– I think we have to be pretty careful to see, you know, how we're going to deal with

486
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,480
this for this century.

487
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:56,760
Yeah, which can potentially be far worse, you know, because, yeah, we haven't learned

488
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:03,200
anything and history rhymes because basically human nature persists. That's the reason

489
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:09,360
of it. But the difference right now is that we also have the technological tool to make

490
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:18,060
that Borg structure or hive mind reality into an actual reality, you know, first through

491
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:24,360
media and social media and eventually through genetic engineering. And, you know, we are

492
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:34,720
at the very, very vital and extremely important point in history that, you know, we – I

493
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:42,280
do believe that we either go into evolve into a post-human species or we just end up annihilating

494
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:49,640
ourselves basically. This is not a place we can stay much longer. I want to talk more

495
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:54,120
about this, but I think we laid the ground for about 45 minutes for you to talk a little

496
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:59,440
in depth about the cases that you're dealing with, your lawsuits. You mentioned that you

497
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:07,440
sent me links to some articles from 2014, Neibar versus Slippery Rock University. And

498
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:14,200
there's another one. This is from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, psychology professor as Slippery

499
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,080
Rock University claims gender discrimination.

500
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:24,000
All right, Chris, let's get to where these problems are coming from. You mentioned that

501
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,720
they started in 2014. You're involved in the second lawsuit. And let's hear whatever

502
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:35,440
there is to hear about it and how it all begun. How is it going and where do you think it's

503
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,440
headed?

504
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:42,840
Well, again, I transitioned from the old world to the new world. And again, that happened

505
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:51,960
sometime around 2014. But I started off my career late 90s and academia was really a

506
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:59,160
place that was pretty minimum in politics. You could walk around and you could actually

507
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:06,240
say who you voted for and people might joke about it. Maybe someone came across as being

508
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:11,160
on the right. And if you look at the numbers back then, it was always in balance, but it

509
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:19,120
was something like two liberals for every one conservative. And so the numbers, they

510
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:25,000
were always in balance, but there was enough of diversity there that it wasn't really a

511
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:31,440
hive mind. And then it wasn't really something coherent, something that, like you said, it

512
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:37,320
all became more real when with the internet and with that kind of instantaneous communication

513
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:41,720
that we have now that hive mind has become much more externalized and almost a reality

514
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:50,920
to it. So I was in a department that did have a male chairperson. He died from cancer and

515
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:56,840
then that's kind of when everything changed. So he was out of the scene and it just, that's

516
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:03,080
when I remember everything just sort of turned. It seemed to me that the main mission was get

517
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,080
him out.

518
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,080
This is why you-

519
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:14,800
Well, this was about 2014. It was maybe earlier than that, 2012 to 2013, because I found myself

520
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:23,520
being removed from every committee. I was getting really horrible reviews. I was getting

521
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:29,080
complaints because certain things I would do at meetings, like supposedly I slammed

522
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:33,240
my fist down on a desk one time at a meeting. I'm like, I don't think I've ever slammed

523
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:41,200
my fist down ever on anything. So all these complaints started coming up and like I said,

524
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,440
I was just so excluded. The message was so clear. But I was trying to figure out like

525
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:51,920
what did I do? And it's true that I did speak up a few times and I did have a different

526
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,640
opinion but at the time I thought, well, different opinions are just that. They don't mean hate.

527
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:01,880
They don't mean, they're just different opinions. And so there was a time when they wanted to

528
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:06,240
hire and a lot of these problems started when they were doing new hires. So they wanted

529
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:12,600
to hire someone and I found a really qualified male applicant and I was an advocate for him

530
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:20,240
and they went with a far less qualified. And it wasn't just a little far less. It was like

531
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:26,560
order of magnitude less than this other individual. And I really fought for the guy, not because

532
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:32,000
he's a guy. I just thought because he was better at the job. He had more experience,

533
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:38,240
far more experience. And then the person that they hired had no formal experience but tons

534
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:44,600
of political activism. And that's when I started kind of picking up on this, this transformation

535
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:51,440
where departments went from being ordinary places of discourse to the hive mind starting

536
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:59,840
to form. And the politics were more important than the scholarship. And that was a really,

537
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:04,680
I don't think I really caught on to that until maybe I was in the middle of the lawsuit or

538
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:11,800
it started to hit me of, okay, you know, this is what's happening. And it's not just my

539
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,280
university, it's actually happening in a lot of, that's when I started hearing stories

540
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:25,720
from other places. So the university now, again, it's an all-female, all-white department

541
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:34,440
in psychology in terms of full-time faculty. And the remarkable thing about this is that

542
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:42,200
we've also just brought in a new position, the infamous diversity, inclusion, and equity

543
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:50,960
department. So we now have a department that does that. And to me, I'm like, well, okay,

544
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:56,000
that sounds noble, you know, diversity and all of them except the equity thing seems

545
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,440
to be a little bit more difficult to understand exactly.

546
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:07,020
It's diversity, equity, and inclusion. It should be diversity, inclusion, and equity

547
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:13,440
because then it would write as D.I. Now it's D.E.I. D.I. is way closer to what is going

548
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:18,640
on with this concept than the other thing. Please continue, sorry.

549
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:23,320
I had the same insight, I thought, because I kept putting the letters together. Well,

550
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,480
actually if you switch these around a little bit, it's actually D.I. which is pretty much

551
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:38,600
what it felt like they wanted me to do. But it really got a little intense in terms of,

552
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:43,920
in fact, it even got so bad that, so I had filed the federal lawsuit and then I was kicked

553
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,280
out of the department. And that was really remarkable to think that like I could get

554
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:53,080
kicked out of the department. I thought the lawsuit would keep you, they would watch themselves

555
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:58,520
for retaliation. They wouldn't want to do something so overt as to retaliate. So they

556
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:03,120
kicked me out and then it took a lot of work to get my lawyer and reminding them what they

557
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:10,640
just did. And then they sort of took it back and said, well, we didn't really do that.

558
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:17,760
But then it was about 2017 and we were doing a lot of settlement talks. And I don't think

559
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:23,560
I still, you know, it's been such a slow process for me to really put together what's going

560
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:29,640
on that I still, and maybe I trivialized it because it was just too overwhelming. You

561
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:36,240
know, particularly in 2017, I was the only voice that I knew of that was dealing with

562
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:44,120
this. I felt really isolated, really alone, zero support. And most of the stuff I got

563
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:48,360
was like, look, you know, you started seeing these hints like, well, you're just a privileged

564
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:52,800
white male. So, you know, don't cry about it when some of your privileges get taken

565
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:58,120
away. And so it was that sins of the father mentality that was like, I have to pay the

566
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:04,880
bill because supposedly my people who had the same skin color and gender as me did this

567
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:10,640
horrible stuff according to you, but I'm left paying the bill. And that mentality seemed

568
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:16,120
absolutely unethical. And it seemed very primitive. It seemed like the way we would have, again,

569
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:22,680
maybe thought, you know, thousands of years ago. And so it was just, you know, it was

570
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:32,080
shocking that this was happening, that it could be so absolutely simplistic. But every

571
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:36,440
time I would say, well, let me challenge this a little bit. Let me see if maybe that's really

572
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:40,080
on track. Every time I would challenge it, I guess kept finding more and more evidence

573
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:45,160
to support this. Like, okay, well, you know, and I've still asked my, I've asked my university

574
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:52,080
several times, well, what did I do? You know, just tell me. Because I've literally been

575
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:56,960
guilty of this for so many years now of something worthy of being kicked out of departments

576
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:03,600
because I've been kicked out of two now. But anyway, to get back to the settlement, it

577
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:07,800
was a little overwhelming at the time. And they offered me a pretty good deal. They said,

578
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:12,640
we'll let you go off and you can do your own department in cognitive science. You can kind

579
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:20,280
of do whatever you want to do. And to be honest, that felt very enticing. I was very excited

580
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:26,960
about that. So I said, okay, you know, we'll do this. So I was in another department and

581
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,680
I got to develop a cognitive science concentration. So it's not like a major or anything. It's

582
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:34,760
just like this, you know, kind of small little thing that some people might be interested

583
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:38,400
in. And I felt pretty comfortable with it. And I developed six new courses and everything

584
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:44,560
was going really well. In fact, I had students filling up the classes. They really liked

585
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:49,360
it because I offered classes on consciousness and left right brain and artificial intelligence

586
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:54,080
and things the university hadn't even thought of offering before. And so the classes were

587
00:54:54,080 --> 00:55:02,760
filling up. Everything's going okay. Okay, so round two. And so I'm going to tell you

588
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:07,200
this story and I'm going to tell you it like as I absolutely remember it. And it's one

589
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,560
of these, it's such a powerful story, I think, because it gets at exactly what's wrong with

590
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:16,400
the universities now. So we had, so I was in this department, it's called Interdisciplinary

591
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,440
Programs and it was a good place for me to be because they were all social scientists,

592
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:28,800
anthropology, sociology. And so it was a place for me to do something that was eclectic like

593
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:34,480
cognitive science. And so I walk into our spring meeting and I was about 45 minutes

594
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,840
late because my daughter had a medical, she had an impacted wisdom tooth so I had to run

595
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:43,720
her up and get her fixed before the meeting. So anyway, I run in, I'm just 45, the meeting

596
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:49,620
lasts all day. So 45 minutes late isn't, it's like a morning to late afternoon, four o'clock

597
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:53,800
or something meeting. So I didn't think that's such a big deal. And I walk into the room.

598
00:55:53,800 --> 00:56:00,560
I remember we're a social science department, you know, Department of Interdisciplinary

599
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:04,720
Programs. So the whole thing is based around social science. I walk in and there's a huge

600
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:13,840
thing on the board and it says the Department of Cultural Studies and Diversity, big, you

601
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:19,560
know, Department of Culture. I'm like, okay, that's a little strange. Mission statement,

602
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:25,880
diversity, inclusion, equity. I'm like, okay, well, that's weird too because where did that

603
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:32,240
come from? I was soon told that they had, in my absence, redefined themselves, which

604
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:37,160
they're not allowed to do, as a department. They redefined themselves as a new department.

605
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:43,080
They're no longer a social science department. They are now a department of cultural diversity,

606
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:46,960
cultural studies and diversity. Okay. And their mission statement isn't social science

607
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:55,560
any longer. The mission statement is the inclusion, diversity and equity. And I was a little confused

608
00:56:55,560 --> 00:57:00,240
and I thought, well, this is really strange. And they said, well, where does cognitive

609
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,600
science fit in this? And it didn't take me too long to figure. I'm like, it doesn't fit

610
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:05,600
in at all.

611
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,600
It doesn't, yeah.

612
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:14,200
Cognitive science is a scientific discipline. It has nothing to do with political activism.

613
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:18,000
And they said, well, you need to leave. You're no longer part of the department. And at the

614
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,720
time the dean was present and that was it. It was like, you're gone. And so the irony

615
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:28,560
of that is we're at a time where we get these new departments of diversity, inclusion and

616
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:33,320
equity. And of course, the first thing I did when I went back to my office is I wrote the

617
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:38,800
president of the university. I wrote the provost. I wrote HR. I wrote the diversity office.

618
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:44,040
I just sat and wrote a letter explaining what just happened to me. That's not even

619
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:49,760
permissible within our own guidelines. We're not allowed to just make up a new program

620
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,040
out of any. It's like imagine going into biology one day and they don't like some biologists

621
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,440
because they think that they're on this political side.

622
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:02,520
I'll give you a better example that is more sensible for everybody. This is exactly what

623
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:08,120
happened in Seattle when a bunch of these people went and they created autonomous zone.

624
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:12,980
And they said, this is our territory now. It's not Seattle. It's not even the U.S.

625
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:17,440
This is a territory that is just, we were just built a tier and there are people still

626
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:22,960
living there. There are still shops. And when they ask the mayor of Seattle, hey, what is

627
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,000
up with what's going on with all these people? She said, we're probably going to have a summer

628
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:33,680
of love. That was her explanation. Also coming from the same political ideology and political

629
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:39,880
perspective. So it's, it sounds like exact same thing happened in the academic set up.

630
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:44,360
It was just a smaller scale of the exact same thing. Because as I wrote all of these, again,

631
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:48,640
I got a bunch of mixed responses. Sometimes they said, well, you know, that's just the

632
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:55,320
tough luck of your life. Just live with it. And then they said other things like, well,

633
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:58,720
you know, they never really did. They are just complete denial. Like, no, they never

634
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:04,440
did that. And it went back and forth. But the interesting thing is they never investigated

635
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:10,320
it. They never, they were never like, you know, they did this thing that was so, it

636
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:16,040
would be so against their philosophy. If you ask someone and put it in different terms,

637
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:20,600
you know, say something like, you know, you've got a, you know, an all, a mostly male department

638
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:25,000
and there's one female or you could play the race issue with it. And then everyone just

639
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,560
got together and just kicked this person out. You know, it would have been, now that would

640
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:34,880
have been absolutely unacceptable. And heads would have rolled. I mean, everything would

641
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:42,000
have, but because I have a certain status as, you know, color, my skin, I mean, my gender,

642
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,720
for some reason, this stuff comes together and it's kind of like, well, it's just him.

643
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:50,160
And that's that sins of the father again. Like you're paying for this stuff. You had

644
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:55,320
nothing to do with it. And they have, they didn't do a single thing. They didn't investigate

645
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:59,680
it. I was even told by the head of HR, she just, I was explaining the set of meeting

646
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:03,840
to her and she just said, look, I don't care what happened in the past. You know, the only

647
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:09,960
thing I'm concerned about is what's happening right now. And the problem with that is again,

648
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:17,240
obviously there's just something special about my unique setup that's, that seems to give,

649
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:22,240
you know, the red light to these kinds of behaviors. And one of the things I think we

650
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:27,320
need to really work on is some, I'm not a very consistent human being, but I really

651
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:32,180
like, you know, and yes, these are all social, maybe they're all social constructs, countries

652
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:36,440
are social constructs. But if we're really going to work together as a civilization with

653
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:43,280
some kind of coherency, we have to have some kind of consistency. We can't just let some

654
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:49,200
groups absolutely redefine reality and completely get away with it. And then other groups be

655
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:53,080
powerless. I mean, that's the exact oppression that they're talking about. They're saying

656
01:00:53,080 --> 01:01:01,000
we get to construct reality, your version of reality isn't valid. And I mean, it was

657
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:06,920
a, it was a pretty intense experience. And then they just threw me into a department

658
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:13,600
of one. So I went from, you know, being in an actual department with, you know, I think

659
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:18,040
it was eight or nine people. And suddenly I'm like, on this little island of misfit

660
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:24,200
toys, like, but I'm all alone. That's like, well, we'll put you off in your own department.

661
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:30,840
And so it's really, you know, punishment after punishment, department, department of white

662
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:31,840
supremacy.

663
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:40,560
You know, I really think again, well, one of the problems I had too is that I was, there's

664
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:46,000
a guy from the military, he's a retired lieutenant colonel. And, and we got along pretty well

665
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:51,680
because we both thought so much about teaching students how to think for themselves rather

666
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:56,760
than what to think. And we just really thought that was important. And we kind of clicked

667
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:01,880
and he was very good. He was an excellent teacher. He had this ability to go in and

668
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:06,800
really shake up people's reality systems, which I think is part of what education is

669
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:11,800
about, you know, shake things up a little bit, get you thinking and get you to understand

670
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:15,480
how the mind works. So you can, you know, that's like here, here's our gift. We'll

671
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,280
teach you how the mind works. Then you can think about whatever you want and believe

672
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:23,980
whatever you want, but we're not here to tell you what to believe and what to think.

673
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:27,400
And so we connected up and he was in that department with me, that interdisciplinary

674
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:31,200
programs department. He was the leadership person, which fit in also nicely with all

675
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:36,640
this. And they got rid of him very quickly. I mean, he, he was on the chopping block way

676
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:43,560
before I was. And so they had kicked him out first. And then they, depending on how you

677
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:47,720
want to read it, they either fired him, they gave him to classes started in three days.

678
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:52,560
He didn't get a contract until three days before classes started. And so he had, you

679
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:57,080
know, by their own account, they would, it should have been out months before by their

680
01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:02,700
own rules. But anyway, the short version is, you know, it could have maybe some, my association

681
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:07,880
with him. So that's the thing. Like if we're going to, if we're going to really improve

682
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:12,520
society, me and you can talk. Now, if you go talk to some other person that I don't

683
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:19,880
really care for, that shouldn't really affect our relationship. Like, why do I care who

684
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:24,000
you talk? Like, why can't we have a multiplicity and, and understand like, look, there's a

685
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,360
lot of selves in us and, and, and, and there's a lot of different sides to our personality

686
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:33,900
and it's a complex picture. Why does it have to be set up? Like, well, if you are friends

687
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:39,560
with this person, then I can't be friends with you. And to me, I think we're seeing

688
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:44,600
that break a little bit. I'm sure you've seen those conversations between like Ben Shapiro

689
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:49,040
and Russell Brand and people who disagree with each other, but still we're learning

690
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:53,960
to talk again. And we're learning that even if I disagree with you, that doesn't mean

691
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:58,760
I hate you. It just means I disagree with you. And so I do see some hope. That's why

692
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:03,360
I was saying I'm much more of a white pill person. I, in spite of all the stuff that's

693
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:09,800
happened to me and spending 10 years in court and on my second lawsuit and, and it's not,

694
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:15,160
you know, who knows how it's really going right now. But, but I feel extremely confident

695
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:20,280
that, you know, that this will turn in my favor because you can't just do this. You

696
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:25,960
can't, I mean, the school has no policy that says that they could have done this. It violated

697
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:29,880
the lawsuit settlement that said, look, we're going to put you here. But they had no power

698
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:35,800
to just kick me out that one day. So that's, that's really a huge percent of what the lawsuit

699
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:42,120
is about. Because if we really want to improve, it's very difficult to create a bureaucracy

700
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:46,560
around treating other people nice. You know, it's very difficult to say, well, you know,

701
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:53,200
like, you know, because some freedom is just having that ability to be a jerk some days.

702
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,720
And so, but, but you can see us, we're really trying to do that. We're trying to like in

703
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:01,560
court, I think political incorrectness, like political correctness movement, that is kind

704
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:09,440
of the beginning of this bureaucracy around how we treat other people. Now, the thing

705
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:14,400
is, the irony of all that is, is it's really not such a bad thing to treat other people

706
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,400
in a decent way. But I don't think we can create it into a bureaucracy. We can't have

707
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:25,480
rules. You must be nice to this person. And if we are, and I guess the reason I'm saying

708
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:30,080
that is because, do you ever hear the wonderful saying from the East, and Alan Watts used

709
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:34,500
to always say it, he said, when the wrong person uses the right means, the right means

710
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:42,760
work in the wrong way. And so what's happening here is, it's a noble, maybe virtuous idea.

711
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:48,740
But in the wrong hands, what ends up happening is, we create a whole set of like niceties

712
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:53,000
for some people, but then other people can, you know, burn at the stake and like, we're

713
01:05:53,000 --> 01:06:02,160
okay with that. And so, you know, but I, you know, I'm optimistic. I haven't yet heard

714
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:09,440
one person, Jonathan Haidt, Jordan Peterson, and even James Lindsay, I haven't listened

715
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:15,640
to everything that he has done, but I haven't really heard the smoking gun of, okay, well,

716
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:21,560
here's how we fix it. Have you come across anyone with like...

717
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:32,200
You know, it's, it's a matter of what that it is, you know, what are we fixing? Because

718
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:39,760
I think this is a, yes, it's revealing what some people think, because this is not like

719
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:45,360
bunch of people at the top of the hierarchy of bureaucracy, who are pushing this forward.

720
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:50,120
They're also supported by tens of millions of people who, you know, they're the same

721
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:57,240
people who would vote for further restrictions, for vaccine mandates, vaccine passports, just

722
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:05,400
basically some kind of a, you know, supreme authority. Because most of these people are

723
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:10,480
atheists, they have replaced that supreme authority with government. And government

724
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:19,380
now has merged with corporate monopolies, big tech monopolies, more obvious than others.

725
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:27,320
So the fix from my perspective, because I see the solution as access and choice. And

726
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:34,700
I see the trend of technological evolution towards more access and more choice. This

727
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:43,280
obviously is disrupting some of our own structures, including the society, including institutions.

728
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:48,960
But then we have to make the choice between whether or not these structures that we have

729
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:55,200
built and they've worked for as long as they have, are we really insistent on keeping these

730
01:07:55,200 --> 01:08:02,960
structures intact, even though they've been rotted to the core? Or we just move on to

731
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:10,960
whatever comes next, and we're building the alternative at the same time. So the solution

732
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:19,240
is building, because the problem is cancelling. And it's being driven from centralized points

733
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:24,640
of authority, centralized structures of authority, which have emerged in the form of monopolies.

734
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:29,980
You know, government is a monopoly, academia is a monopoly. So even the right questions

735
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:36,880
are not being asked, because the questions need to be asked that pursue the aim and the

736
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:42,960
objective of people who are running these monopolies. If you're running a university

737
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:47,480
and somebody comes and say, hey, I want to talk about race and intelligence, you're not

738
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:52,360
going to do that, because people who are supporting you and funding you are not okay with that.

739
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:56,720
But that is probably one of the most important topics that we do need to talk about, because

740
01:08:56,720 --> 01:09:00,720
it's affecting everything else, especially now that we're building artificial intelligence.

741
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:09,160
You know what I'm saying? So the solution is not a utopian solution. The solution is

742
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:14,120
allowing individuals to experience themselves in a de-central kind of a manner, which is

743
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:19,080
the equivalent of being able to go to different shopping stores and buy whatever you want,

744
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:24,880
and then form tribes in a voluntary kind of a way. That, you know, we see the evidence

745
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:31,880
of that online and in virtual kind of environments far more than this world, because access and

746
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:37,560
choice is limited in this world by design. But digitally, you know, like World of Warcraft,

747
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:41,880
that was a society of people who came together around this video game, you know, they all

748
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:46,800
coming from different backgrounds. None of that mattered. You came together to achieve

749
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:51,800
certain kind of objective within that game. And then you went on and joined your other

750
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:56,520
tribes, who could be, you know, your classmates or family. So you didn't have one specific

751
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:01,760
kind of a tribe. You had different tribes for different objectives. And so I think this

752
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:07,880
is where we are headed. I'm also judging based on developments that are happening technologically.

753
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:11,960
You know, we're moving from web two, which is what we have now to web three, which is

754
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:17,200
serverless decentralized. Nobody owns the data. Everybody who is in the network own

755
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:22,480
the network, but nobody really owns it. It's decentralized. And they're serverless. So

756
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:26,480
you don't have like Twitter, they were like, Oh, you're talking in the way that we don't

757
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:30,560
like you to talk about, we just kind of silence you, we're going to remove you. But at the

758
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:35,960
same time, there are a lot of push. I don't know if you saw a so called whistleblower

759
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:39,680
emerge from Facebook saying that Facebook allowing people to say whatever they want

760
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:46,680
for profit. And the solution that she provided is for government to have more basically supervision.

761
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:53,880
To more control over the big tech that everybody calling nonsense on that. And she's an instrument

762
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:58,480
of furthering this monopoly, basically merging it with the government. So I think that's

763
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:04,680
where we are that people have more access and more choices because of our tools that

764
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:08,460
have advanced in a way that you know, the president of United States probably wouldn't

765
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:14,160
even have access to this level of technology 20 years ago. And people who are invested

766
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:22,240
in those monopolies and in those centralized, or centrally determined objectives, they're

767
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:26,240
throwing everything they can at it because they're losing control.

768
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:33,000
Hmm. Yeah, actually, if I had some input with that, it's actually it's similar in some ways.

769
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:38,680
Because one of the ways I see out of this is is just practicing really deeply into spirituality

770
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:45,360
because the whole trip of most spiritual traditions is that particularly in the East is that you're

771
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:51,360
just not this body. And so it's that recognition like race is really trivial, my gender is

772
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:58,040
really trivial. And yet we've escalated these to such self defining qualities that, you

773
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:02,320
know, there's this whole thing where kids try to figure out what their gender is. And

774
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:06,840
yet at the same time, the spiritual movement is saying, your gender is really not who you

775
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:11,960
are. So really, why is why even think about it? It's not who you are.

776
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:17,640
I think, actually, if I may say this, because we obviously been talking about this for a

777
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:22,800
while, just you and me, and we've been thinking about this much, much longer. And I think

778
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:29,200
now because there is a equivalent in the digital world of everything that is happening here,

779
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:34,040
it's very important to make this distinction that yes, you're not your body, but at the

780
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:41,120
same time, you need your body to survive in this structure that is a society that is built

781
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:47,800
by humans who are not necessarily smarter than you are. So I think more than focusing

782
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:55,480
on the spiritual side, it's more profound to recognize the difference between who you

783
01:12:55,480 --> 01:13:02,120
are in this body and in this form and who you really are objectively. Right? And when

784
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:08,040
you see that difference, then your race and your culture wouldn't make that much of a

785
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:14,240
difference compared to your avatar that you use in some video games. For example, this

786
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:19,460
is how how you want to represent yourself in the digital world. This is how you represented

787
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:25,800
because of the game of evolution in this world. Yet none of it is objectively real. These

788
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:32,680
are constructs. Objectively, what is real, that's for you to figure out on your own.

789
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:39,160
There can't be any kind of an objective directive for that either. So it becomes a game.

790
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:47,800
Yeah, the body, you're stuck with it. And so, you know, it's not this kind of thing

791
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:52,560
like just, you know, stop working out or anything. But the idea is that it's just not central

792
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:58,480
to your identity. And then it's that neti neti movement where you're just not this,

793
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:02,320
not that. So you say, well, I'm not really my age. I'm not really my gender. I'm not

794
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:06,960
really this name. I'm not really... And then you strip all that away and then you get back

795
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:11,600
down to this real mystery that's impossible to put into words. But it's far more who you

796
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:18,200
are. And in that way, so again, and it sounds contradictory in some ways, but you move away

797
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:25,400
from this. It's actually what Jung called the quest of the hero. The quest of the hero

798
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:33,080
was to be embedded in this massive collective and to venture out individually and explore

799
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:40,040
your own path. I love that one place in the, it was the legends of King Arthur where the

800
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:44,240
Knights of the Round Table, when they entered the dark forest, they had to enter at their

801
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:49,200
own place. They couldn't go where there was a path. And so that's the thing. It's like

802
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:54,400
we're all having this adventure of figuring out our own identity. And it seems like it's

803
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:59,400
moving from the collective identity that culture tells us and they just tell us this. And well,

804
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:06,160
here's who you are to the adventure of stripping all that away and seeing what's left. And

805
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:10,920
in some cases, you have these transcendent experiences. And this is where these, you

806
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:17,160
know, like Nisargadatta or, you know, Ramana Maharshi and these like really classic spiritual

807
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:23,440
teachers, I mean, they were so, their whole practice centered around removing illusion

808
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:29,480
and getting at what is true. And there's just certain things that, you know, culture, it's

809
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:34,760
so pervasive, conformity is so pervasive. We don't even realize how often we think,

810
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:38,840
well, I'm thinking for myself. But you don't realize that your thoughts aren't even your

811
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:43,860
own either. You didn't invent a language. You didn't invent half the things that you're

812
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:47,840
thinking about. Would you still think of the same thing if you were born a thousand years

813
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:51,880
ago on the other end of the globe? And what we need to get to the original, okay, what's

814
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:58,200
the common, you know, what am I beyond all these illusory social roles? And then you

815
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:07,320
come to some very peaceful places and it's very hard to be combative when you get into

816
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:12,200
that state. But that's, you know, maybe just a small part of it. I think like anything,

817
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:17,880
it's a complex problem. It's not gonna be one easy, there's never one, you know, switch

818
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:23,560
to flick when it comes to complex problems. It's gonna be, you know, all kinds of things

819
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:30,520
that have to come together. But, you know, the Stoics had a great saying, you know, the

820
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:35,200
obstacle is the way. And so what I do is I look at all these obstacles and I say, well,

821
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:41,040
you know, this is the way. And so much of what I've dealt with has given me deeper insights

822
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:46,400
on how to deal with this stuff, you know, deeper, more interesting tricks on how to

823
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:52,400
deal with, you know, being kicked out over and over and dealing with bureaucracy. And

824
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:58,480
you see this, it's a funny thing where cancel culture backfires. They get rid of these people

825
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:04,300
and then they end up becoming famous. They're doing podcasts now, they're doing book deals.

826
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:08,760
And so, you know, or even like what happened with Dave Chappelle, you know, they say, well,

827
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:13,040
you know, we're gonna cancel and then it really doesn't seem to work. There's something about

828
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:18,480
that path of individuation. Again, so I think our species, you know, we had to have most

829
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:22,880
of us be conformist, but we also needed some percentage of us that were individuals. I

830
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:27,280
mean, how do you grow? How do you come up with something new unless someone breaks the

831
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:32,760
mold? And so I think we've got these people on the hero's journey and they're out there

832
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:38,640
being individuals, they're resisting the board mentality. And the funny thing about them

833
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:45,040
is, you know, the collective thinks that they've destroyed them, but they've empowered them.

834
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:49,840
And suddenly, they're having book deals and they don't even have like real jobs anymore.

835
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:53,480
They just, you know, real in a sense like, you know, nine to five kind of thing. They're

836
01:17:53,480 --> 01:18:00,560
just enjoying what they're doing, going on podcasts and, you know, creating discussions

837
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:07,600
about what happened to them. I mean, would Jordan Peterson really be where he's at if

838
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:14,760
the whole pronoun debate didn't kind of launch him in the fame? I mean, on the one hand,

839
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:21,400
I mean, he's a smart guy, but, you know, he got thrown into the limelight because of a

840
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:26,720
particular debate that wanted to cast him out, but they never were able to do it. They

841
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:33,080
made him more powerful than he could have ever been as an ordinary university professor

842
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:36,200
if that debate had never taken place.

843
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:42,660
Yeah, Jordan Peterson is a perfect example, obviously, for him standing up in academia,

844
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:49,160
but also they cut his budget. I was in Toronto at a time when all of this was happening and,

845
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:53,060
you know, leftists were out of control back then in Canada. I think now they've pretty

846
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:59,960
much taken over all the institutions in that country in kind of a very non-competitive

847
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:06,800
kind of way, but when they cut Jordan Peterson's budget, they crowdsourced and they raised

848
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:11,560
like, I think something like 10 times the amount that he would have gotten. So that

849
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:16,400
was like a flicker and I think it was like 2017, something like that, that, hey, you

850
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:21,880
don't really need institutions, this whole connectivity globally, because it would be

851
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:27,240
very silly to say that only Canadians are learning from Jordan Peterson or only, you

852
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:31,600
know, English-speaking people are learning from, for example, Jordan Peterson. There

853
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:36,460
are people all around the world and you've got like a couple million people each chipping

854
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:41,700
like two dollars, you know, all of a sudden he's making tens of millions of dollars, which

855
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:46,880
as you said, made him more powerful.

856
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:53,840
The other thing is this concept of good and bad, right and wrong, again, objectively yes,

857
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:59,840
they don't exist, but when you're on a boat and somebody start putting a hole in that

858
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:06,360
boat, because there is a context, you understand what is good and what is bad in a very obvious

859
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:13,280
kind of a way, right? Now, if your boat end up sinking, you might find some kind of a

860
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:18,400
treasure that's been buried, you know, under the, you know, wrecks of a ship under the

861
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:23,320
ocean and all that. Yes, that's a possibility, but also it's a suggestion that there is no

862
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:30,040
such a thing as absolute good and bad. You know, I was telling someone else very unhappy

863
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:37,000
about lockdowns during COVID and stuff and very activist against critical race theory.

864
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:42,400
So I was telling her, hey, without lockdowns, most parents wouldn't have found out what

865
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:48,920
is being taught at public school in K to 12 education system, including a lot of this

866
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:53,000
critical race theory. And she said, yeah, you're right. I'm like, well, so lockdowns,

867
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,960
were they good and bad? You know, in the objective sense, you cannot say whether they were good

868
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:03,600
and bad, because if they end up leading to some kind of a actual enlightenment as a result

869
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:07,600
of all of this, well, they were all good, but they were also bad because a lot of people

870
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:12,120
got harmed by them. So I think this is, this is an important thing that people begin to

871
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:18,920
understand that, Hey, I can be, let's say a conservative Jesus believer, but when someone

872
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:26,640
like Dave Rubin, who's coming from the left and talking common sense, I can rely on some

873
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:32,960
of his perspective and some of his realizations in order to build myself that raft that Buddha

874
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:36,160
talks about, you know, you need a raft to cross the river, but you're doing that on

875
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:42,960
your own. Eventually, you know, there is no collective salvation. Ultimately, it is being

876
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:47,160
promised, but it's poisonous, I think.

877
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:52,600
And it's, that's why we're all on this. And again, it's an irony to talk about the self,

878
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:56,520
the ego as an illusion, but at the same time, say, look, we're all on this adventure in

879
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:01,720
a very individualistic way. Look, the world's filled with interesting contradictions. I

880
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:10,800
think this is just another one of them because, well, like I said, it was that, that's that

881
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:14,560
whole hero's adventure, but I was going to go somewhere else with that. And then I sort

882
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:19,040
of got distracted, but maybe to come back to me in a second.

883
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:24,200
Yeah, voluntary tribalism. You know, we would come together for a lot of different things

884
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:29,760
and we have great times doing that. You know, at the dinner party, we're a tribe. We got

885
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:34,680
around because of food and good conversation. And then we go to music festival. We are a

886
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:39,360
new tribe with a bunch of other people. The problem is you, like in my case, you're born

887
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:43,800
into a religion called Islam. And then they tell you all throughout your school that if

888
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:48,160
you leave this religion, it's punishable by death. So you might as well just, you know,

889
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:53,760
just submit and do all these other things that we're asking you to do, which is very

890
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:58,360
aligned with where these leftists are, Marxists are coming from. And, you know, interestingly

891
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:03,520
enough before the Iranian revolution, Marxists and Islamists, they had made an alliance against

892
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:08,680
the Shah of Iran, who they consider to be puppet of United States. So totalitarians

893
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:17,880
are always aligned in this pursuit of forced collectivism, forced tribalism based on some,

894
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:23,080
you know, a utopian ideal that is good for the collective. And, you know, the counter

895
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:27,420
to that is voluntary tribalism because I don't think we can get rid of tribalism. Tribalism

896
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:33,480
has been very, very effective and useful. It still is. But so is individuality. This

897
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:39,980
ability to be able to opt in and opt out at any given time, for any given reason, based

898
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:45,400
on whatever kind of objective that you individually have, that you can find other people share

899
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:49,600
that objective with you. And when you're done with that objective, you go and, you know,

900
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:50,600
find your own way.

901
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:55,780
And actually, that's excellent. I would probably, like from my view, I would just, we're talking

902
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:59,680
about the same things using different words. I'd probably say like playful tribalism versus

903
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:04,440
serious tribalism. And so when you're playful with it, you know, then you switch modes and

904
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:09,760
suddenly I'm a musician talking to musicians, and that's my tribe. And then maybe, you know,

905
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:15,320
you switch and then, you know, within a fraction of a second, you're doing so. But it's like

906
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:20,560
you said, I love that idea, like, you know, voluntary tribalism, because then that puts

907
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:25,760
the individual and to break out of that collective. What I was gonna mention is, you know, it

908
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:30,320
gives you, you know, Carrie Smith, she does the podcast, I think, Unsafe Spaces.

909
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:33,280
Oh, yeah, I heard the name, yes, and the podcast.

910
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:39,680
So there's a couple things I would suggest, if you're watching this, that because she

911
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:45,400
was very much into the cult, and she describes it as a cult, like the leftist cult, she adopted

912
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:51,920
this viewpoint, like everything is racist, everything is sexist, and just like, you know,

913
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:57,360
confirmation bias, she just found it, of course, because that's the way it works. And so I

914
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:03,120
was talking to her, just texting or something, and I said, what could I have said to you

915
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:08,360
that would have broken you out of that mindset? You know, how could I have woken you up from

916
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:17,120
being woke? I mean, and she was like, that's a great question, and I think she pondered

917
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:23,440
on it, she never got back to me on it, because I think it's like, it's such an individual

918
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:30,160
process that, like, she was on her own, it was her who woke up from it. She was the one

919
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:34,480
who suddenly realized that the collect, she didn't want to be part of the collective anymore,

920
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:38,840
and she wanted some choice. And actually, she even kind of describes, like, you know,

921
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:43,960
this idea, like, now she has tribes and stuff, but they're all, you know, very voluntary,

922
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:47,360
and you're not committed, you're not signing your life away to anyone. So you can quit

923
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:52,960
a tribe at any time, and it's not a lifelong, and there's no reason why you can't be part

924
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:57,640
of inconsistent tribes. And so maybe, you know, A and B would never get along, but you

925
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:04,240
have no problem being part of A and B. And so that's a flexibility, and I think that's

926
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:10,800
really important. I would also, when I was, you know, just so many things that happened

927
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:17,240
last 100 years, we just, we so quickly forget. And I'm sure you're familiar with Jim Jones

928
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:24,320
and Jonestown and the whole cult and the capacity of them to drink the Kool-Aid, which I really

929
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:27,600
don't like that expression because I don't know if you're familiar with the details,

930
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:32,120
but he was literally too cheap to buy Kool-Aid. He bought Flavor-Aid, which just seems to

931
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:38,360
be like, look, you know, like everyone's, it's like you're doing this massive act of

932
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:44,240
insanity, and yet somehow you're worried about the budget. It just shows the complexity and,

933
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:49,960
you know, inconsistencies in how disturbed his thinking was. But not everyone, one of

934
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:53,300
the things that was super important about the documentary, even though it was horrific

935
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:59,520
and it was almost a thousand people that died, not everyone did. So we can always look with

936
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:07,520
these massive, you know, conformity, and we find people who found themselves, you know,

937
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:17,100
it was an older woman, I think, who hid under a bed and survived Jonestown. So I think that's

938
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:21,840
really hopeful. And I guess that's why I'm hopeful about this. I think we're gonna find

939
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:26,160
our individual, we're gonna find the importance of, I just like the way you put that. I think

940
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:31,360
we're gonna find the importance of having a voluntary tribe to be able to pick and choose

941
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:35,920
what tribes we are. And that really satisfies the old program. It gives it something to

942
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:42,640
do. It satisfies its needs, but it doesn't create, you know, the massive collective of

943
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:48,160
one single tribe that's, you know, kind of, like I said, steamrolling over everyone else.

944
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:54,160
And that's when, you know, that's the real tragedy. So the 20th century was that that

945
01:27:54,160 --> 01:28:00,640
one tribe got so big and then it got so massive and it was capable of inflicting so much damage

946
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:06,600
that we don't wanna have any one tribe get that big again. I mean, we're always, you

947
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:12,900
know, going around our ancestors' groups of 50 to 100 max. We're not used to these kind

948
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:19,400
of, you know, millions of people being communist or millions of people being any one tribe.

949
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:25,400
I mean, that's just something that our programming isn't adapted to deal with. So I do think

950
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:30,200
there's hope, but I do think it lies in that individuality and finding your own path, which

951
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:40,040
is always difficult to do. But, you know, who is it? The mythologist Joseph Campbell

952
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:48,800
said, follow your bliss. You know, that's a great pointer to finding your own path because

953
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:53,240
some of these paths are just dreadful. You know, I think the biggest thing I've noticed

954
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:57,360
over the last 10 years, I used to go into a classroom and I'm not much of a comedian,

955
01:28:57,360 --> 01:29:02,000
but as a professor, you know, I do my best and I'll do weird jokes and stuff. And I used

956
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:08,560
to get a classroom going. I mean, we would just have fun and it was all light and playful.

957
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:11,600
And I think the biggest thing I've noticed over the last 10 years is I walk into a classroom

958
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:17,720
that like the energy is just, you can feel it. It's different. It's dreadful. It's like,

959
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:23,240
what can we find that's wrong with everything? And I think we've done real disservice to

960
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:30,480
students because, you know, that's a recipe for depression. It's a recipe for anxiety.

961
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:35,600
And we shouldn't really be doing that to them. You know, I'm surprised there isn't some kind

962
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:40,760
of class action lawsuit where millions of students all get together and realize that

963
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:46,120
what they bought in their education at the university was not what was sold to them.

964
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:50,160
And just do a massive class action lawsuit and say, we want our money back because you

965
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:54,520
said you were going to, you know, you said you were going to teach sociology and, you

966
01:29:54,520 --> 01:30:02,080
know, I came out a Marxist. I mean, you know, so, and that may happen. I've kind of been

967
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:04,680
waiting around and I'm just surprised it hasn't already.

968
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:12,400
Well, I think we're getting to something similar to that. Because one of the reasons that this

969
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:18,800
Virginia election went the way it did was because the Democrat, McAuliffe, he said parents

970
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:26,520
shouldn't tell school what to teach to their children. And that was the point that everything

971
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:30,760
began to shift because people are like, and you know, this is not something that is limited

972
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:37,080
to that race. This is a motto of that movement. Washington Post came out a couple of days

973
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:42,480
after that saying parents claim they have the right to shape their kids' school curriculum.

974
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:49,440
They don't. I'm like, what? So for a lot of people, I think, because, you know, the result

975
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:54,360
in Virginia couldn't have happened only with Republican votes. It must, they must have

976
01:30:54,360 --> 01:31:01,840
include some Democrats and many independents going and voting for this Republican governor

977
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:04,840
because there are more. It's like by, by a million, I think that there's a difference

978
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:10,600
between registered Democrats in Virginia, but people, you know, when it gets to their

979
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:17,160
pockets and it gets to their children, it must be some kind of a, you know, organic

980
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:22,640
evolutionary thing that you forget everything else. And this is the most important thing.

981
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:26,200
And that is exactly why the left is targeting your money and your children. Because if you

982
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:30,440
don't have money, you don't have choice. If you're giving up your children at age three

983
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:36,400
or four that these people are pushing for, then, you know, there isn't that far of a

984
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:42,520
difference from there to Jonestown, which I think it's also interesting to mention Jonestown

985
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:48,200
as far as I know, they're blaming the dude, Jim Jones for all of it from the beginning

986
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:54,200
to the end. But apparently towards the end, he was so drugged up and messed up that he

987
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:58,280
wasn't really in charge of things. So there were a lot of women within that group that

988
01:31:58,280 --> 01:32:03,640
carry on with, you know, all the operation and all the ideas and all those things, which,

989
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:07,600
you know, again, there are leaders who are pushing this kind of thing, but there are

990
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:13,480
millions of people who are empowering it. When they're giving you a snitch line to snitch

991
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:18,120
on your neighbor, for example, in Los Angeles, if they're having party, call the mayor's

992
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:23,720
office so they shut down their electricity and their water, their hydro stuff. And a

993
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:27,880
lot of people are doing it. And I totally believe it because they used to do that in

994
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:34,600
Iran all the time, just because it would look good and good students from the perspective

995
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:37,400
of the government, from the perspective of the authority.

996
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:44,400
Yeah. I think, like you said a little earlier, that, you know, we have a, it's close to saying

997
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:47,320
we have a martial arts, we say, you know, everyone has a theory till they get punched

998
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:48,320
in the face.

999
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:49,320
Exactly.

1000
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:54,680
We've got all these, you know, political ideologies and stuff, but when it starts hitting, you

1001
01:32:54,680 --> 01:33:00,840
know, the family, when it starts hitting, you know, hitting us and things that we really

1002
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:07,240
hold dear, I mean, then you see this with the parents, they stepped in and, you know,

1003
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:11,440
have been extremely vocal about critical race theory and what and I think even if people

1004
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:18,120
are not familiar with the Jane Elliot studies, they know how susceptible kids are to being

1005
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:23,000
taught political philosophies and particularly when the other side isn't being taught. You

1006
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:27,800
know, I don't have any problem with any kind of political philosophy at the university

1007
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:30,880
as long as both sides of the issue.

1008
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:34,640
And just to give you one other example, back when I was in psych, there was a bunch of

1009
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:40,520
students out and they were, you know, at a booth and they were advocating the, or not

1010
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:48,320
advocating, they were criticizing the gender pay gap and, you know, the whole 30 cents

1011
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:53,560
that women make or 70 cents on the dollar that men make a dollar for or something like

1012
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:57,560
that. And I'm like, okay, you know, everyone knows that wage gap debate that's been around

1013
01:33:57,560 --> 01:34:03,440
forever, like 30 years. And I said, okay, well, that's fine. But what about the death

1014
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:08,640
gap? And they just looked at me and like, what do you mean the death gap? And so what

1015
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:12,720
about the homeless gap? And they're like, what are you even talking about? I'm like,

1016
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:20,680
well, you realize that like men not only die sooner, but the suicide rate is like astronomically

1017
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:26,360
higher among men than it is with women. The homelessness rate with men is...so I was just

1018
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:30,240
giving them the counterargument. That's all I was doing. I was like, okay, would you rather

1019
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:34,080
die soon or make a little bit more money? And that's assuming that, you know, the gender

1020
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:39,580
pay gap was valid to begin with. But that's the point of debate. And they never heard

1021
01:34:39,580 --> 01:34:43,540
the idea, so they were able to reject it. The first time they heard it is when I told

1022
01:34:43,540 --> 01:34:47,480
it to them. Like, they never even heard of the death gap. I'm like, how could you go

1023
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:52,160
through a gender studies class and come out thinking that, you know, you want to be an

1024
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:56,380
advocate for social change? Well, how can you be an advocate for social change when

1025
01:34:56,380 --> 01:35:00,800
you're hearing one side of the story? Like, what makes you think, you know, why are you

1026
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:07,280
going to be able to change things when you've only heard part of the debate? It amazes me.

1027
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:11,440
Well, there's a wonderful line from Robert...I don't know if we're getting close to the end.

1028
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:15,480
I like to leave it at an optimistic place, but this is a little bit dark. But I think

1029
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:22,000
it's actually a good...it has a positive ending to it. And one of Robert Oppenheimer's, you

1030
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:29,600
know, famous, you know, nukes and all this stuff, but one of his...my favorite quotes

1031
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:35,040
of his, he said, look, it's absolutely obvious the world is going to hell. The only chance

1032
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:41,260
we have of ever stopping this is to stop trying to stop it. And, you know, and it was such

1033
01:35:41,260 --> 01:35:46,000
a great thing that Alan Watts used to talk about all the time and that he would say,

1034
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:50,440
you know, and that's why Alan Watts, maybe that's why he's coming back into popularity

1035
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:56,400
because he said, look, all these self-helpers, they're just troublemakers. They're people

1036
01:35:56,400 --> 01:36:03,120
with egos and they think they know what they're doing. But, you know, why? It's a terribly

1037
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:07,480
egotistical thing. If you want to go out and change the world, first, sit back and think

1038
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:13,040
why you think you have the wisdom to change it in the right direction. And he even quoted

1039
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:18,480
Confucius, which I've never found the original quote on this. So, you know, fact check that,

1040
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:23,040
I don't know. But he was quoting Confucius and he said, and he was translating it and

1041
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:27,160
he said, and I'm just trying to give a feel for this is just back in the 60s he was talking

1042
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:32,480
about this. But he said, the goody-goodies are the troublemakers of the world. And he

1043
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:36,920
was trying to point out that like, you know, and almost in this Jungian sense, that if

1044
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:42,320
I have a bright persona, I end up having a very dark shadow. So all these advocates for

1045
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:48,080
like, let's all make the world a better place. There's such a long history of those being

1046
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:54,020
the real troublemakers that, you know, I think we need to be really careful who's stepping

1047
01:36:54,020 --> 01:37:01,600
up saying, you know, just trust me on this. I'll change the world and I've got a plan

1048
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:07,000
and just kind of close your eyes and just hope it all works out. And I just think we

1049
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:13,080
have to be, you know, the social activism movement has to pause for a little bit, do

1050
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:16,920
some self-reflection and ask a really simple question like, what makes me think I've got

1051
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:24,960
the answers? You know, these are complex problems and it's so rare for us to have such nice,

1052
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:29,880
clear insights into even simple things in our own life, let alone thinking like, look,

1053
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:42,840
I can fix racism by introducing critical race theory. Do you know that? I mean, what makes

1054
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:47,560
you so absolutely, because again, if you're not gonna consider the other side of the debate

1055
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:52,480
and say, well, okay, well maybe critical race theory is gonna make us actually more racist.

1056
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:58,980
If you don't even consider that, then, you know, why are you in charge? Why did you step

1057
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:04,800
up and start telling people what to do? And this is the reason that they don't want to

1058
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:09,660
train thinkers. They want to train activists and they want to get to your children as soon

1059
01:38:09,660 --> 01:38:15,840
as they can. So that will become the de facto default state of the world. It's just so obvious.

1060
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:22,960
It's just that more people seem to be waking up to it because, you know, when you go in

1061
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:29,680
United States to buy something and you can't find it on the shelf and you see that people

1062
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:34,560
who run this country are telling you, actually, the problem is that you expecting too much.

1063
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:43,120
So lower your expectation. Then, you know, along with your kid coming home and ask you,

1064
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:48,720
am I evil because I'm white? You know, this is just not a good combination to happen to

1065
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:52,320
anybody, especially people who've been living here. And, you know, Americans are, you guys

1066
01:38:52,320 --> 01:39:00,080
are like super nice and super generous, but unbelievably majority of Americans ignorant

1067
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:07,520
of the potential and capacity of evil. That how much worse this whole thing can get if

1068
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:13,720
you just allow these people who are nothing but totalitarians. That's what they are. They're

1069
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:18,260
totalitarians. They don't want any argument. They want submission and they're using ethics

1070
01:39:18,260 --> 01:39:25,920
and morality and we are in this place, you know, for better or worse as a result of enlightenment.

1071
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:33,080
That that gotten rid of that centralized supreme authority in the form of God as interpreted

1072
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:37,880
by religions that I don't apply to that. But at the same time, I don't consider myself

1073
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:43,920
being an atheist. I think that concept of the divine divinity has been hijacked by other

1074
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:51,480
totalitarians who are, you know, priests and bishops and all those people. And, you know,

1075
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:56,240
once you got rid of that centralized authority, it brought with it a lot of good, but at the

1076
01:39:56,240 --> 01:40:03,860
same time, it replaced academia and professors with churches and priests. And that's where

1077
01:40:03,860 --> 01:40:07,740
we are and it cannot go on any longer, you know, because this idea of equity at some

1078
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:11,760
point it will get to genetics and they will like, Oh, actually, we know that we are unequal

1079
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:17,400
at the genetic level. So we have all the rights to alter the genetic of all the white babies

1080
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:21,920
to be to create, you know, this is not science fiction. This can happen within the next five

1081
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:28,680
to 10 years if we don't stop this insanity where it's headed. But I, you know, fortunately,

1082
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:33,280
I see that more people are waking up yet. This does not mean that everything is going

1083
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:39,040
to be great because this can also lead to somewhere even darker than where we are right

1084
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:41,920
now. We just don't know.

1085
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:47,560
Now, you reminded me of another lecture that Alan Watts had where it was just brilliant.

1086
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:51,960
He said, and it would have fit so well in terms of like the real power of diversity

1087
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:57,520
because he was on a genetics committee and they were asking like, you know, what kind

1088
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:01,520
of variables should we consider? And he brought up a really important point to begin with.

1089
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:05,960
He said, look, we're, how do us who are genetically inferior even make a decision about what genetics

1090
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:10,600
superiority even is? We're not in that kind of position. But then he gave, I think, some

1091
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:14,040
of the best advice. He said, whatever you do genetically, make sure you have a vast

1092
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:19,440
diversity because you never know what we're going to deal with. And so, you know, some

1093
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:23,320
of the activists might say, well, hey, we can get rid of toxic masculinity and we can

1094
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:28,760
go in and we can create males that are not completely non-aggressive. And you say, well,

1095
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:33,280
that's a great idea. And then the aliens attack and then you're kind of like, where are those,

1096
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:37,760
you know, men are just going to go out and not even care, you know, just fight like heroes

1097
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:44,360
and they're gone because we think we can predict the future and it's very difficult.

1098
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:48,160
So I like that idea. You know, whatever we do genetically, let's not, because we may

1099
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:54,520
need introverts or we may need extroverts and we may need, you know, for all we know,

1100
01:41:54,520 --> 01:42:00,040
we may need, you know, drunken, you know, people we might think, well, if we could just

1101
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:04,920
get rid of these, you know, certain types, the world would be a better place. And you

1102
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:09,360
don't realize how complex systems are balanced out and you can't just take one little thread

1103
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:15,800
and pull on it and not affect the whole thing. And so those are dangerous systems to mess

1104
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:21,960
with. I hope we don't because I don't think we have the wisdom to deal with that type

1105
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:22,960
of complexity.

1106
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:26,280
Yeah. We don't know where we were. We don't know where we are. We don't know where we're

1107
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:31,880
going and neither does anyone else.

1108
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:35,120
That's the wisdom. You know, a lot of spiritual teachers say that wisdom begins with the I

1109
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:42,280
don't know mind and I really like that because that stops a lot of activism in their tracks

1110
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:47,760
because they'll, you know, so much, not all, but some activism starts off with this, like

1111
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:52,500
I know, I have this moral circuit and I know exactly in the same way that people burned

1112
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:57,120
witches knowing that that person was a witch and the inquisition and, you know, we can

1113
01:42:57,120 --> 01:43:01,240
go through so much of human history where people, absolute, these people didn't stay

1114
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:08,000
awake at night regretting what they did. They went to sleep, you know, absolutely confident

1115
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:14,920
that they were virtuous and so we have a long human history. But you're right about, you

1116
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:19,980
know, how easy it is to forget about the last century and how it doesn't seem like we're

1117
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:26,760
really getting a very good education and I'll ask students about, you know, some dictate

1118
01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:32,840
something that happened, you know, one of the great bloody wars and no one knows anything

1119
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:37,760
about it. I mean, they can't even name like, I mean, people know about Hitler and people

1120
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:44,840
and, you know, they could talk a little bit about Mousetongue or, you know, some of these

1121
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:51,400
other Stalin, I mean, they really don't know the stories of the number of people and so

1122
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:57,040
many people died and they don't even have accurate estimates. I mean, there's so many,

1123
01:43:57,040 --> 01:44:01,560
you know, in the millions that it's very difficult to calculate and that could be really important

1124
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:08,560
for us to digest and because what it shows, I think, is that, I mean, this is like a very,

1125
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:15,620
this program for violence and this program for conformity and the conformity, the power

1126
01:44:15,620 --> 01:44:21,960
of us to inflict pain on the outgroup in the name of being virtuous is actually remarkable.

1127
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:28,600
We have a long human history of doing this and it might be time and it could be where

1128
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:38,480
we simply recognize the program for what it is and maybe there's hope. I don't know.

1129
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:46,120
I was going to ask you to give a message to the world to end the podcast, but I think

1130
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:52,440
you already did. So I think this is a good place to end it. You said, I hope, I don't

1131
01:44:52,440 --> 01:45:00,520
know. Perfect. I think it is, you know, hope is, there's one of my old favorite movies,

1132
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:05,600
Shawshank Redemption, he gives a little speech about hope is the best of things and nothing

1133
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:11,520
good ever dies and I just, I think it's important. We haven't had enough hope, you know. I mean,

1134
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:17,440
there hasn't been that person who stood up and gave us a great speech to kind of act

1135
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:22,320
was we have hope programs too and those hope programs got us through a lot of rough times

1136
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:30,880
but we haven't had that person who got up and gave that speech that turned it on and

1137
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:36,800
just kind of brought it back to life. So we felt hopeful again because, you know, Nietzsche,

1138
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:42,680
when he wrote, when Victor Franco wrote Man's Search for Meaning, he opens it, you know,

1139
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:47,800
about all the concentration camps, his survival and all the suffering, but he opens it up

1140
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:52,760
with a quote by Nietzsche who said, he said, you know, if you have a why, you can deal

1141
01:45:52,760 --> 01:46:02,560
with any how and, you know, but that's, it's real close, you know, that purpose, the meaning,

1142
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:32,480
the hope, those things could get us through this, you know, it's possible.
