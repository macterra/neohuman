00:00.000 --> 00:02.600
Like I said, our entire government believes in an afterlife.

00:02.720 --> 00:04.880
No wonder they don't care about transhumanism.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.720
No wonder they don't care about living far longer because they believe there's

00:08.720 --> 00:11.440
an afterlife out there and they're going to be singing with angels as soon as

00:11.440 --> 00:14.400
they die. And, you know, I just, I don't believe that at all.

00:21.640 --> 00:25.680
Hello and welcome to the 39th episode of New Human Podcasts.

00:25.680 --> 00:29.160
I'm Agabahari, an egologist on Twitter and Instagram,

00:29.160 --> 00:33.200
and you can follow the show on liveinlimbo.com, iTunes, and YouTube.

00:33.760 --> 00:38.560
I recently had the opportunity to have a live conversation via Skype with Zoltan

00:38.600 --> 00:42.040
Isfan as part of an event for the Toronto Transhumanist Meetup,

00:42.440 --> 00:43.880
which I also co-organize.

00:44.520 --> 00:46.880
Zoltan has been on the New Human Podcasts before,

00:46.880 --> 00:49.320
and it's always a pleasure to welcome him back.

00:49.960 --> 00:53.360
Okay. So we have with us today Zoltan Isfan,

00:53.400 --> 00:56.920
who most of you should know who he is,

00:56.920 --> 01:01.200
but for the less informed among us, Zoltan, why don't we start with hearing a little

01:01.200 --> 01:04.000
bit about your background, the work you've done and what you're focusing on now

01:04.000 --> 01:05.200
these days, and we'll take it from there.

01:06.800 --> 01:11.440
Sure. Well, I think, if you take a step back,

01:12.320 --> 01:17.240
I began my futurist career in 2013 when I published

01:17.240 --> 01:19.240
my novel, The Transhumanist Wager.

01:19.920 --> 01:23.560
And that book did, I guess, quite well.

01:23.560 --> 01:29.040
And after that, I sort of became a public figure in the movement

01:29.320 --> 01:32.120
and then in the transhumanist movement.

01:32.360 --> 01:35.480
And from there, I sort of just said, well, what can I do to actually help it?

01:35.480 --> 01:38.040
And since I was a journalist, I began writing a ton of articles.

01:38.440 --> 01:43.400
And after that, I said, well, you know, maybe I should run for president

01:43.400 --> 01:47.760
because it's a 2000, you know, the 2016 elections are coming.

01:47.760 --> 01:56.120
And it's a pretty unique opportunity to get my message, the transhumanist

01:56.120 --> 01:58.600
message, out there when everyone's watching.

01:58.600 --> 02:01.920
And so I ran for president under the formation of the Transhumanist Party.

02:02.400 --> 02:06.160
And lo and behold, the campaign did very, very well.

02:06.160 --> 02:07.680
It was very, very visible.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.040
And I did that for over two years.

02:10.040 --> 02:13.640
And it did so well that, of course, I didn't win.

02:13.640 --> 02:16.560
I did so well, but that I thought I'd run for governor.

02:16.560 --> 02:19.480
Now of California, I'm running as a libertarian this time, instead of

02:19.480 --> 02:22.080
as under the Transhumanist Party, but of course, I'm still running

02:22.080 --> 02:23.280
a transhumanist platform.

02:23.520 --> 02:26.360
So that sort of brings everyone up to speed, I guess, to how this happened.

02:26.360 --> 02:29.760
But a lot of it began with the novel I published called The Transhumanist Wager.

02:31.040 --> 02:34.720
Yeah, we're going to talk about your run as a governor, but I want to ask you,

02:34.720 --> 02:38.240
since you ran as a presidential candidate in the Shet Show, that was

02:38.400 --> 02:42.720
presidential campaign of 2016, and you went across the country and talked to

02:43.040 --> 02:45.280
many different people from different backgrounds.

02:45.280 --> 02:47.600
Why don't you tell us what is happening in America?

02:47.600 --> 02:51.080
Because a lot of people are just amazed and surprised and confused.

02:51.080 --> 02:53.080
And what is the forecast, in your opinion?

02:53.080 --> 02:53.560
What's coming?

02:56.200 --> 03:01.120
Well, you mean what is coming politically or what is coming in the transhumanist world?

03:01.120 --> 03:07.680
Why isn't a transhumanist world depend or depend directly to what's happening politically?

03:08.480 --> 03:13.440
Well, I'm not optimistic at the moment because I feel with Republican and

03:13.440 --> 03:22.480
Congress in the executive branch, we have a potential problem, because, let's be honest,

03:22.480 --> 03:30.720
conservatives generally will hold back technology more than other types of politicians will.

03:30.720 --> 03:34.320
And that presents a problem because, for example, Mike Pence has already expressed some,

03:34.880 --> 03:39.360
at least that I've heard, some angst at genetic editing, and genetic editing is potentially

03:39.360 --> 03:43.520
the most important transhumanist and science of the 21st century.

03:43.520 --> 03:47.200
So if we have conservatives in government that want to hold back stuff like that, then

03:47.360 --> 03:48.960
we're in very big trouble.

03:48.960 --> 03:53.680
On the other hand, I think generally Trump will be okay for science because he's a capitalist.

03:53.680 --> 03:56.640
And it is capitalism that moves forward science.

03:56.640 --> 04:01.680
The problem, though, is really, does only some parts move forward?

04:01.680 --> 04:05.680
Like AI seems to be moving forward, but if genetic editing doesn't go forward, then maybe

04:05.680 --> 04:07.680
we don't get the longevity that I want.

04:07.680 --> 04:09.680
Instead, we get only the technology.

04:09.680 --> 04:11.680
So these are some of the worries that I have.

04:11.680 --> 04:15.680
I mean, ultimately, it would have been better to just have somebody who was very pro-science

04:15.680 --> 04:22.480
and pro-capitalism, I think, when you talk about the long-term ramifications of transhumanism.

04:22.480 --> 04:26.480
Maybe capitalism can survive and be on 10 or 20 more years.

04:26.480 --> 04:30.480
But the question was to try to answer the environment today.

04:30.480 --> 04:34.480
The reason, you know, I'm not a Trump supporter, just everybody knows that.

04:34.480 --> 04:37.680
But the NASDAQ and the stock markets have been hitting new highs.

04:37.680 --> 04:42.480
People are optimistic about money filtering into the companies like Google and Apple and

04:42.480 --> 04:44.480
other companies that make the technology.

04:44.480 --> 04:48.480
It is an environment that a lot of stuff can come out.

04:48.480 --> 04:55.280
That said, if we get into a position where all of a sudden fascism takes over or, you

04:55.280 --> 05:00.480
know, people like Mike Pence, the vice president, really want to hold back science, then we

05:00.480 --> 05:04.480
could be in for a very terrible scenario.

05:04.480 --> 05:08.480
It's not unfolding like I wanted, but right now we're still doing okay.

05:08.480 --> 05:10.480
But there are plenty of things to worry about in the horizon.

05:10.480 --> 05:12.480
A lot of challenges, yeah.

05:12.480 --> 05:16.480
You said that you're still running on a transhumanist platform.

05:16.480 --> 05:22.480
So please explain what is a transhumanist platform that you're running on and why are

05:22.480 --> 05:26.480
you running as a libertarian in a solid Democrat state?

05:26.480 --> 05:28.480
What are you trying to achieve?

05:28.480 --> 05:32.480
Well, you know, to be honest, I'm a left-leaning libertarian.

05:32.480 --> 05:34.480
I've been very honest about that from the beginning.

05:34.480 --> 05:39.480
I support a universal basic income and I support a lot of the policies of the Democratic Party.

05:39.480 --> 05:43.480
However, I'm also quite libertarian in many ways.

05:43.480 --> 05:49.480
And I just felt like I had a better chance of making a real impact in the California

05:49.480 --> 05:51.480
gubernatorial race as a libertarian.

05:51.480 --> 05:55.480
I mean, after all, there's already like 10 other candidates that are running as Democrats.

05:55.480 --> 05:59.480
And frankly, some of them are, you know, seasoned politicians.

05:59.480 --> 06:03.480
Whereas, you know, by coming in as a libertarian, I came in as sort of the leader of the pack.

06:03.480 --> 06:09.480
And that was a great, from a point of view of making an impact, that's really important.

06:09.480 --> 06:13.480
I think, though, a transhumanist platform, where my platform becomes quite different,

06:13.480 --> 06:17.480
is that I'm, you know, a number one goal of mine is still longevity.

06:17.480 --> 06:19.480
And it's also very much healthcare.

06:19.480 --> 06:23.480
Even though I don't support a universal healthcare, I support a universal basic income

06:23.480 --> 06:28.480
with the idea that all this extra money can pay so everybody has healthcare.

06:28.480 --> 06:33.480
And I just feel like it's the right of the nation and the right of the citizenry

06:33.480 --> 06:36.480
to fight for its own people's longevity.

06:36.480 --> 06:40.480
And this is something that's, you know, very, very important to me.

06:40.480 --> 06:44.480
I'm not going to give that up just because, you know, as a libertarian,

06:44.480 --> 06:48.480
I'm not supposed to want government in everybody's, you know, plates and bedrooms or whatever.

06:48.480 --> 06:50.480
I don't want that.

06:50.480 --> 06:56.480
But at the same time, I do feel very strongly that a national agenda should be longevity.

06:56.480 --> 06:59.480
A national agenda should be moving the species forward

06:59.480 --> 07:02.480
and making people's lives better through science and technology.

07:02.480 --> 07:08.480
Yeah, longevity has been on one of the premier policies that you've been following.

07:08.480 --> 07:14.480
What steps have you taken to make aging to be recognized as a disease?

07:14.480 --> 07:17.480
And what are the obstacles and opportunities ahead of us?

07:17.480 --> 07:20.480
Well, and that's the number one thing. In my opinion,

07:20.480 --> 07:23.480
you really need to make aging recognized as a disease

07:23.480 --> 07:25.480
because otherwise there's zero funding for it.

07:25.480 --> 07:28.480
I mean, right now the amount of funding that is going into,

07:28.480 --> 07:31.480
from the NIH, National Institute of Health,

07:31.480 --> 07:33.480
you know, which gives the billions and billions of dollars,

07:33.480 --> 07:37.480
is just not giving much money to people.

07:37.480 --> 07:40.480
Not to researchers, not to universities, not to corporations,

07:40.480 --> 07:44.480
because anti-aging is somewhat against government policy.

07:44.480 --> 07:47.480
You have to understand, in America, 535 members of Congress,

07:47.480 --> 07:52.480
all nine Supreme Court justices and our president and vice president, are religious.

07:52.480 --> 07:54.480
They believe in an afterlife.

07:54.480 --> 07:57.480
So they're not going to take government money

07:57.480 --> 08:01.480
and say, let's put it towards something that wants everybody to live, you know, forever,

08:01.480 --> 08:03.480
or at least thousands of years.

08:03.480 --> 08:05.480
That's just sort of anti-religious.

08:05.480 --> 08:08.480
What's important, though, is what I'm trying to do is change the culture.

08:08.480 --> 08:11.480
If you can classify aging as a disease,

08:11.480 --> 08:14.480
then all of a sudden funding will fund from the government,

08:14.480 --> 08:16.480
and also culture will start changing.

08:16.480 --> 08:21.480
People may elect politicians that are more interested in

08:21.480 --> 08:25.480
practices that would make people live a lot longer and maybe even overcome death.

08:25.480 --> 08:27.480
You have to be careful, because like I said,

08:27.480 --> 08:32.480
right now 100% of our government, at least on paper, says they believe in an afterlife.

08:32.480 --> 08:36.480
And when I talk about ending death, that's very,

08:36.480 --> 08:39.480
that's sort of like changing the institution entirely.

08:39.480 --> 08:41.480
And that's exactly what I was going to ask you.

08:41.480 --> 08:44.480
Do we have a problem with the foundation of a political system

08:44.480 --> 08:48.480
that we have in the United States, which is corrupted, very slow,

08:48.480 --> 08:51.480
and as you said, extremely religious?

08:51.480 --> 08:53.480
I remember you were telling me you were going to the South,

08:53.480 --> 08:55.480
and everybody were saying you have a chip in your hand,

08:55.480 --> 08:58.480
so this is a mark of the beast, you're anti-Christ, and all of,

08:58.480 --> 09:01.480
like what, how are we going to change those people who, you know,

09:01.480 --> 09:04.480
voted for Trump when he stood up there and said,

09:04.480 --> 09:07.480
I know the system best, so I'm the only one who can change it,

09:07.480 --> 09:09.480
and he got all those votes.

09:09.480 --> 09:12.480
How are we going to tell them that, hey, you don't need to die,

09:12.480 --> 09:15.480
and you don't need to go to heaven and hell, and Jesus might be good for you,

09:15.480 --> 09:18.480
but don't shove it down our throats.

09:18.480 --> 09:20.480
How are we going to get there?

09:20.480 --> 09:25.480
It seems to just go a very long, long, far, far away.

09:25.480 --> 09:27.480
Well, one thing I think we just got to wait it out,

09:27.480 --> 09:31.480
because it does seem like a lot of millennials are far less religious.

09:31.480 --> 09:35.480
And I also think we need to fight back, and we have to fight back with technology.

09:35.480 --> 09:40.480
It's a lot harder to justify Christianity in the technological age

09:40.480 --> 09:41.480
or in the machine age.

09:41.480 --> 09:44.480
Questions like, should artificial intelligence believe in Jesus?

09:44.480 --> 09:46.480
That's such an absurd question.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.480
As soon as you start thinking about that question,

09:48.480 --> 09:50.480
you realize how ridiculous religion is.

09:50.480 --> 09:53.480
And these are the things that technology might actually make

09:53.480 --> 09:55.480
the religious question obsolete to some extent.

09:55.480 --> 09:58.480
Now, I'm not saying that people shouldn't be religious.

09:58.480 --> 10:01.480
What I'm just saying, though, is the fundamentalism has to change.

10:01.480 --> 10:04.480
They need to stop going, you know, if they want to believe in Jesus

10:04.480 --> 10:07.480
as some kind of overriding spiritual power.

10:07.480 --> 10:10.480
Because even I must say, you know, even though I say I'm an atheist,

10:10.480 --> 10:13.480
if you really ask me downright, do I know if there's an afterlife or not,

10:13.480 --> 10:15.480
I don't know. Come on.

10:15.480 --> 10:17.480
I mean, I'm not that smart. Nobody's that smart.

10:17.480 --> 10:21.480
Anyone that says they do is honestly lying.

10:21.480 --> 10:27.480
But the reality is I could accept a much bigger version of God,

10:27.480 --> 10:32.480
but I can't accept one that follows a Bible word for word,

10:32.480 --> 10:36.480
phrase for phrase, and then takes those phrases and applies them to government.

10:36.480 --> 10:37.480
This is insane to me.

10:37.480 --> 10:40.480
This is when we need, you know, the scientific method is what I base

10:40.480 --> 10:43.480
my campaign on, what I base all my philosophies on,

10:43.480 --> 10:46.480
is proving these ideas again and again.

10:46.480 --> 10:51.480
And if an idea proves very useful, you can use it.

10:51.480 --> 10:54.480
But at some point, you have to be understanding that it might not be useful,

10:54.480 --> 10:56.480
and then it's time to upgrade that idea.

10:56.480 --> 10:59.480
That's how a humble person does it, a normal person does it.

10:59.480 --> 11:01.480
If something's wrong, they fix it.

11:01.480 --> 11:04.480
A virgin can be wrong. It's not like we got everything right.

11:04.480 --> 11:07.480
Maybe there is a God. I'll be the first to say that.

11:07.480 --> 11:12.480
But to pinpoint it down on some Judeo-Christian person with a red beard

11:12.480 --> 11:16.480
or long hair and, you know, says that you can only be forgiven your sins

11:16.480 --> 11:19.480
and go through Christ to reach heaven,

11:19.480 --> 11:21.480
this is not a system I want to teach my children.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.480
It's not a system I want to live in.

11:23.480 --> 11:28.480
So we have to fight against that and rail against that with media,

11:28.480 --> 11:31.480
you know, what you're doing today with your podcast.

11:31.480 --> 11:33.480
I mean, these are the kinds of things that make a difference.

11:33.480 --> 11:36.480
And we're winning. Don't for a second think we're not.

11:36.480 --> 11:37.480
When you look at the younger generation,

11:37.480 --> 11:41.480
there's never been so much lack of religiosity in this nation,

11:41.480 --> 11:45.480
and already 50% of Europe is atheism.

11:45.480 --> 11:46.480
So we're winning.

11:46.480 --> 11:51.480
There's no question that, you know, secularism to some extent is winning.

11:51.480 --> 11:55.480
And it may not be secularism. It just might be less fundamentalism.

11:55.480 --> 12:00.480
So I'm encouraged, but it's going to be 20 or 30 years

12:00.480 --> 12:02.480
before we really start to see some real progress.

12:02.480 --> 12:06.480
That's still, I think, a pretty optimistic timeframe.

12:06.480 --> 12:10.480
I'm going to ask you the question that David McPherson wanted to ask you,

12:10.480 --> 12:15.480
but I'm going to also mention, because you quite correctly, I think,

12:15.480 --> 12:19.480
brought up how absurd Christian transhumanism is.

12:19.480 --> 12:23.480
And I've had Lincoln Cannon from Mormon Transhumanist Association

12:23.480 --> 12:27.480
and Christopher Benwick from the Christian Transhumanist Association,

12:27.480 --> 12:29.480
both on the podcast.

12:29.480 --> 12:33.480
And to me, it seems like they're using transhumanism

12:33.480 --> 12:36.480
to justify their religious belief.

12:36.480 --> 12:40.480
But one thing that they do have in common is that they both,

12:40.480 --> 12:43.480
and James Hughes is not the person I talked to,

12:43.480 --> 12:48.480
they all are against you to run as a transhumanist figure, as I'm sure you know.

12:48.480 --> 12:51.480
So David McPherson is asking, with that in mind,

12:51.480 --> 12:57.480
why do you think you're such a polarizing figure within the transhumanist community?

12:57.480 --> 13:03.480
I'm not a big fan of talking about, I guess, myself and this conflict,

13:03.480 --> 13:05.480
but I'll just try to be honest.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.480
But this is a community, right?

13:07.480 --> 13:12.480
If these people in the community are just throwing rocks on your way,

13:12.480 --> 13:14.480
why do you think that is?

13:14.480 --> 13:18.480
I don't know. It's a bummer, too, because I feel like we're all in this for longevity.

13:18.480 --> 13:22.480
That's one of the cruxes of the situation of our community,

13:22.480 --> 13:24.480
is that we all don't want to die.

13:24.480 --> 13:27.480
When people get in the way of other people,

13:27.480 --> 13:30.480
everyone says, oh, I damaged the movement,

13:30.480 --> 13:36.480
but I made the movement quite large because I was sort of the sole mainstream journalist.

13:36.480 --> 13:41.480
I put out 200 articles almost in the last three years in huge places,

13:41.480 --> 13:43.480
Gizmodo, VICE, Newsweek, Wired.

13:43.480 --> 13:46.480
It went around the world.

13:46.480 --> 13:49.480
I was just looking yesterday at one of my new videos,

13:49.480 --> 13:51.480
or the videos from the last week.

13:51.480 --> 13:55.480
In two weeks, it went up from 14 million views to 16 million views.

13:55.480 --> 14:02.480
You have to understand that's more traffic than Humanity Plus gets in an entire 365 days,

14:02.480 --> 14:05.480
what I often get in a day or two now.

14:05.480 --> 14:09.480
Are they just jealous?

14:09.480 --> 14:11.480
I don't know.

14:11.480 --> 14:17.480
What I think is, honestly, there has never been a journalist in the movement,

14:17.480 --> 14:19.480
and I appeared and all of a sudden,

14:19.480 --> 14:23.480
journalists have a way of making things happen in a different way.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.480
We have an amazing amount of scientists.

14:25.480 --> 14:29.480
We have an amazing amount of engineers, an amazing amount of technologists,

14:29.480 --> 14:32.480
but we also need popularizers.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.480
We need provocateurs.

14:34.480 --> 14:37.480
We need people that actually go out there with a coffin bus

14:37.480 --> 14:40.480
and drive around and spread it to those people in the South

14:40.480 --> 14:42.480
who really don't want to hear it.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.480
Then you get those people in the South,

14:44.480 --> 14:47.480
put you on Infowars and all this other crazy stuff.

14:47.480 --> 14:50.480
In the meantime, what happens is it starts building,

14:50.480 --> 14:51.480
and you get recognition.

14:51.480 --> 14:53.480
Now, the recognition may not be good at first,

14:53.480 --> 14:56.480
but a lot of the recognition will never be good.

14:56.480 --> 15:01.480
To the Trump people, Hillary was never a good person.

15:01.480 --> 15:04.480
It's going to be polarizing no matter how it goes.

15:04.480 --> 15:07.480
I think what's important, though, is the recognition.

15:07.480 --> 15:10.480
If you hear the word transhumanism enough times,

15:10.480 --> 15:13.480
and you hear that science and technology can defeat death,

15:13.480 --> 15:16.480
you start to believe in it or you start to hate it.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.480
Whatever it is, at least it invokes a kind of a reaction.

15:19.480 --> 15:23.480
I guess my coming on the scene and doing that so dramatically

15:23.480 --> 15:25.480
really got a lot of people upset.

15:25.480 --> 15:28.480
Maybe it was jealousy. Maybe it was just, I don't know,

15:28.480 --> 15:31.480
maybe they didn't like my sense. I don't know.

15:31.480 --> 15:33.480
It's hard to know exactly why,

15:33.480 --> 15:38.480
but obviously I caused a big hoo-ha in the whole community.

15:38.480 --> 15:41.480
I think it's jealousy, but we'll see.

15:41.480 --> 15:44.480
I don't like to say that just because I'm not sure

15:44.480 --> 15:46.480
what there's really to be jealous of.

15:46.480 --> 15:48.480
It's like we're all going to live longer,

15:48.480 --> 15:50.480
and the movement has grown into something

15:50.480 --> 15:52.480
that's almost mainstream now.

15:52.480 --> 15:56.480
I see the New York Times using the word transhumanism.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.480
They don't even think about it anymore.

15:58.480 --> 16:00.480
This is now a real movement.

16:00.480 --> 16:03.480
What they're saying basically is that because of your book,

16:03.480 --> 16:05.480
I think that you want to become a totalitarian,

16:05.480 --> 16:07.480
transhumanist king who wants to chip everyone,

16:07.480 --> 16:10.480
because you also mentioned about refugees from Syria.

16:10.480 --> 16:13.480
It's one of the ways they can control it.

16:13.480 --> 16:16.480
I don't know if anyone's ever read the ending of the book,

16:16.480 --> 16:20.480
but the totalitarian king gives back the entire world

16:20.480 --> 16:23.480
to a free, democratic environment

16:23.480 --> 16:26.480
and goes to live in the woods and writes philosophy.

16:26.480 --> 16:29.480
In many ways, that's what a strong armed leader would do.

16:29.480 --> 16:32.480
A strong armed CEO will sometimes do that.

16:32.480 --> 16:35.480
He creates a company, he's done what he needs to do,

16:35.480 --> 16:37.480
and then he leaves.

16:37.480 --> 16:40.480
In the meantime, everybody's gained a whole bunch more freedoms.

16:40.480 --> 16:43.480
Sometimes it does, and this is just the novel I'm speaking of,

16:43.480 --> 16:47.480
but I think sometimes it's okay to push those extra boundaries.

16:47.480 --> 16:49.480
That's how change occurs.

16:49.480 --> 16:52.480
I just want to point out that the guy in the book

16:52.480 --> 16:54.480
ends up not being a totalitarian king,

16:54.480 --> 16:58.480
but just a humble philosopher who willingly, openly gave

16:58.480 --> 17:00.480
the world back to the world.

17:00.480 --> 17:02.480
Yeah, they just make whatever they want out of it

17:02.480 --> 17:04.480
the same way they're doing the Bible.

17:04.480 --> 17:08.480
For the records, you told me, I spoke to you about a year ago,

17:08.480 --> 17:10.480
and you told me that you're going to step down

17:10.480 --> 17:12.480
from transhumanist party leadership

17:12.480 --> 17:14.480
and just give it to the community,

17:14.480 --> 17:16.480
and that's exactly what you did,

17:16.480 --> 17:20.480
because you're not necessarily part of transhumanist leadership,

17:20.480 --> 17:22.480
transhumanist party leadership anymore, right?

17:22.480 --> 17:24.480
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm not.

17:24.480 --> 17:26.480
I'm an advisor to the transhumanist party,

17:26.480 --> 17:28.480
and I still strongly believe in it,

17:28.480 --> 17:32.480
and maybe I'll try to help at all times,

17:32.480 --> 17:34.480
but maybe I'll take a leadership role in the future.

17:34.480 --> 17:37.480
I don't know, but right now I handed it over

17:37.480 --> 17:41.480
to Gennady Stolerov, and he's done an excellent job,

17:41.480 --> 17:43.480
and I think he democratized it.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.480
He did a better job democratizing it than I did.

17:45.480 --> 17:47.480
That's okay to say,

17:47.480 --> 17:50.480
and I like a lot of the new policies that have gone on.

17:50.480 --> 17:52.480
The problem, though, is that right now

17:52.480 --> 17:54.480
we're still trying to build the party,

17:54.480 --> 17:56.480
it's still quite small,

17:56.480 --> 17:58.480
it's not getting the same amount of media attention,

17:58.480 --> 18:00.480
and so there were some trade-offs,

18:00.480 --> 18:03.480
but I'm happy to see that the transhumanist party continues,

18:03.480 --> 18:05.480
and I'm a firm believer

18:05.480 --> 18:08.480
that it's a very needed political institution out there

18:08.480 --> 18:11.480
that can actually play a real role in history,

18:11.480 --> 18:14.480
maybe not in the next two years or four years,

18:14.480 --> 18:16.480
but certainly in the next decade or two decades.

18:16.480 --> 18:18.480
Right, I agree.

18:18.480 --> 18:20.480
Let's talk about unemployment,

18:20.480 --> 18:25.480
which is a big subject in the past campaign.

18:25.480 --> 18:28.480
Trump blamed, not refugees,

18:28.480 --> 18:30.480
but illegal immigrants

18:30.480 --> 18:34.480
and people who are working and taking jobs away from Americans,

18:34.480 --> 18:37.480
but the reality is a lot of those jobs are not coming back

18:37.480 --> 18:39.480
due to automation,

18:39.480 --> 18:42.480
but nobody really talked about automation.

18:42.480 --> 18:46.480
So do you think over the next two, three years,

18:46.480 --> 18:49.480
when Trump won't be able to deliver the number of jobs

18:49.480 --> 18:51.480
and the increase in economy that he has promised,

18:51.480 --> 18:54.480
the attention will be shift towards technology

18:54.480 --> 18:58.480
and automation as the main scapegoat?

18:58.480 --> 19:01.480
Yeah, look, Trump, I'm not saying Trump lied,

19:01.480 --> 19:04.480
maybe he just didn't know, but the bottom line, he was wrong.

19:04.480 --> 19:06.480
I mean, this was never about immigrants.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.480
It was crazy to name immigrants as the issue.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.480
I mean, certainly that's something that, like,

19:10.480 --> 19:13.480
when you had outsourcing of jobs a long time ago

19:13.480 --> 19:15.480
to Asia and place Mexico and whatnot,

19:15.480 --> 19:16.480
that made a lot of sense.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.480
Like, you could see the jobs going,

19:18.480 --> 19:21.480
but this time around, it really didn't have to do with immigrants.

19:21.480 --> 19:23.480
If you just followed the numbers, you would say, wow,

19:23.480 --> 19:26.480
I mean, jobs are being replaced because technology is increasing,

19:26.480 --> 19:30.480
and it's not increasing in certain, like, just in agriculture

19:30.480 --> 19:31.480
or just in healthcare.

19:31.480 --> 19:35.480
It's increasing every single field of the economy that we have.

19:35.480 --> 19:40.480
It's really easy for any CEO to see that technology is replacing workers,

19:40.480 --> 19:43.480
and that's going to become so pronounced.

19:43.480 --> 19:47.480
Like, every single day, another day goes by, that increases.

19:47.480 --> 19:50.480
And at some point, people are going to wake up in four years,

19:50.480 --> 19:52.480
or probably in 2020, and say,

19:52.480 --> 19:54.480
wow, we have a massive problem in our hands,

19:54.480 --> 20:00.480
and building a wall is not going to solve the situation.

20:00.480 --> 20:04.480
The situation is going to be solved by a sort of

20:04.480 --> 20:06.480
post-capitalistic type of environment,

20:06.480 --> 20:09.480
which probably is going to involve a universal basic income of some sorts,

20:09.480 --> 20:11.480
which, of course, I support.

20:11.480 --> 20:14.480
There's no way that we're going to continue

20:14.480 --> 20:16.480
when 4 million truck drivers lose their jobs,

20:16.480 --> 20:20.480
when nurses lose their jobs due to robots, when lawyers lose...

20:20.480 --> 20:23.480
I mean, the whole system's changing, the entire system.

20:23.480 --> 20:24.480
And we can't just all be artists.

20:24.480 --> 20:26.480
I mean, maybe we can be,

20:26.480 --> 20:28.480
but I don't think we can feed ourselves all as artists.

20:28.480 --> 20:30.480
So we're going to have to do something.

20:30.480 --> 20:33.480
And I have a bunch of different policies, including the newest one,

20:33.480 --> 20:35.480
which is the federal land dividend,

20:35.480 --> 20:38.480
which takes some of the federal land and tries to monetize it.

20:38.480 --> 20:41.480
But the bottom line is, however we do it, we're going to need it.

20:41.480 --> 20:43.480
Otherwise, people are going to riot.

20:43.480 --> 20:45.480
And the people that are going to riot are the Trump supporters,

20:45.480 --> 20:48.480
because a lot of them are some of the very first ones in line

20:48.480 --> 20:49.480
to not only lose their job,

20:49.480 --> 20:52.480
but just never be able to get another job again.

20:52.480 --> 20:56.480
So let's talk a little about UBI more in depth.

20:56.480 --> 20:59.480
Where does the money for UBI come from?

20:59.480 --> 21:03.480
And I want you to expand on federal land dividend as a funding source of it.

21:03.480 --> 21:06.480
And is there any other alternative other than UBI?

21:06.480 --> 21:09.480
Because some people are not very happy about UBI either.

21:09.480 --> 21:12.480
Real quickly, there are other alternatives.

21:12.480 --> 21:15.480
I mean, government can get everybody a job that they wanted,

21:15.480 --> 21:17.480
but it's the same sort of system.

21:17.480 --> 21:20.480
I guess you might be able to use some kind of blockchain technology

21:20.480 --> 21:22.480
to give certain types of money,

21:22.480 --> 21:24.480
and that could produce some kind of income.

21:24.480 --> 21:27.480
The other thing, I mean, there are a couple different ways of doing it,

21:27.480 --> 21:32.480
but the bottom line is all those are so, in my mind, not really,

21:32.480 --> 21:35.480
there's a negative land tax system.

21:35.480 --> 21:39.480
In my mind, the very simplest thing to do is to understand a very basic concept,

21:39.480 --> 21:45.480
which is 50% of Americans are already on some government support.

21:45.480 --> 21:50.480
To increase that to 100% is not as far as a lot of people think.

21:50.480 --> 21:53.480
It doesn't have to be a huge amount to begin with.

21:53.480 --> 21:56.480
It can only be something that supplements our income,

21:56.480 --> 21:58.480
gives people a little bit of a floor.

21:58.480 --> 22:01.480
But in my opinion, there's two ways to do it,

22:01.480 --> 22:04.480
and that's going to be to raise taxes, or you could maybe tax the robots, whatever.

22:04.480 --> 22:06.480
It's almost the same thing.

22:06.480 --> 22:10.480
Or what I would suggest doing is my federal land dividend,

22:10.480 --> 22:14.480
which Canada probably has the same situation, maybe even more so,

22:14.480 --> 22:22.480
where we have $150 trillion worth of federal land available in America right now

22:22.480 --> 22:24.480
that's basically untouched or unused.

22:24.480 --> 22:28.480
Our national debt is around $20 trillion or a little bit more.

22:28.480 --> 22:32.480
So we have six times the national debt of land sitting out there,

22:32.480 --> 22:37.480
unoccupied resources, minerals, even fisheries and things like that.

22:37.480 --> 22:39.480
People don't want to touch that because they call it nature.

22:39.480 --> 22:41.480
They want to save it for a thousand years into the future

22:41.480 --> 22:44.480
when their great-great-great-great-grandkids are here.

22:44.480 --> 22:47.480
And I understand that thinking until we got to the transhumanist age,

22:47.480 --> 22:52.480
when I have to ask myself is, A, will America survive beyond the next 20 or 30 years

22:52.480 --> 22:55.480
through a singularity? Will we even be humans?

22:55.480 --> 22:59.480
Will we appreciate land in the same way we do when we live in virtual reality environments

22:59.480 --> 23:01.480
where we're leaving planet Earth to go to other?

23:01.480 --> 23:04.480
There's a whole bunch of reasons that thinking a thousand years in the future

23:04.480 --> 23:06.480
isn't very rational anymore.

23:06.480 --> 23:11.480
However, we have 45 million people living in poverty in America today,

23:11.480 --> 23:12.480
many of them who are hungry.

23:12.480 --> 23:16.480
About 15 million children go to Hungary every night in America.

23:16.480 --> 23:22.480
This is something that we can deal with today if we took that $150 trillion worth

23:22.480 --> 23:25.480
of federal land and started to monetize it.

23:25.480 --> 23:29.480
Now, the problem with that idea is, and this is huge, just to give you an idea,

23:29.480 --> 23:33.480
we have 45 million unused acres in California.

23:33.480 --> 23:37.480
That's almost half of California is essentially unused land.

23:37.480 --> 23:43.480
And yes, California is beautiful and nobody wants to build a mall on Yosemite.

23:43.480 --> 23:45.480
I've heard all the arguments.

23:45.480 --> 23:49.480
But at the same time, there are so many poor people in California.

23:49.480 --> 23:57.480
About 40% of Californians live with an income that is less than $24,000.

23:57.480 --> 24:02.480
So that is a very significant problem.

24:02.480 --> 24:08.480
We have to essentially create some kind of income so that those people can get out of poverty.

24:08.480 --> 24:12.480
Well, if we monetize that land out there, that 45 million acres,

24:12.480 --> 24:17.480
whether it's forestry, whether it's minerals, whether it's even just tourism,

24:17.480 --> 24:22.480
we could start paying those 19 million Californians just in California alone,

24:22.480 --> 24:26.480
19 million Californians who live in poverty or who live very near the poverty line.

24:26.480 --> 24:31.480
$24,000 for a household is a very small amount, I have to be honest.

24:31.480 --> 24:34.480
I'm not sure what the Canadian dollar is like,

24:34.480 --> 24:41.480
but if a household in poverty in California only has $24,000 of income,

24:41.480 --> 24:44.480
I can't even see how they could survive anywhere near the Bay Area that I live in.

24:44.480 --> 24:46.480
There's no way to feed yourself on that.

24:46.480 --> 24:48.480
So we need to do something.

24:48.480 --> 24:53.480
And this system that I've devised running for governor worked really good in California,

24:53.480 --> 24:57.480
it can also be applied nationally and even better, it can be applied globally

24:57.480 --> 25:00.480
because many governments are sitting on huge untapped resources.

25:00.480 --> 25:03.480
And the best thing about the plan is it's bipartisan.

25:03.480 --> 25:07.480
I don't try to create plans that like, you know, I mean, I've heard all the things,

25:07.480 --> 25:09.480
give the land all back to the people, it'll be fine.

25:09.480 --> 25:12.480
You know, the reality is the rich people, the conservatives and whatnot,

25:12.480 --> 25:15.480
most of them are in charge, they run the corporations.

25:15.480 --> 25:18.480
But if you want to give them something so that they will say,

25:18.480 --> 25:20.480
you know what, a basic income makes sense,

25:20.480 --> 25:24.480
give them more business opportunity and just say, we just want to be covered.

25:24.480 --> 25:27.480
That's the system that's bipartisan that maybe you might actually be able

25:27.480 --> 25:30.480
to get through Congress someday between both the Democrats and the Republicans.

25:30.480 --> 25:33.480
So this is my way of doing that.

25:33.480 --> 25:36.480
Have you had any conversation with members of either of the parties

25:36.480 --> 25:39.480
about your approach to this problem?

25:39.480 --> 25:42.480
And have you found any kind of alliance in either of the parties?

25:42.480 --> 25:47.480
And if so, which party you found to be more in line with what you're talking about?

25:47.480 --> 25:49.480
Well, it's very tough.

25:49.480 --> 25:51.480
The answer, the short answer is no.

25:51.480 --> 25:52.480
The Democrats...

25:52.480 --> 25:55.480
No, you haven't talked to them or you haven't found any alliance?

25:55.480 --> 25:58.480
Well, I've tried and haven't found any alliances.

25:58.480 --> 26:00.480
I do have friends in parties.

26:00.480 --> 26:02.480
They're not really necessarily that high up.

26:02.480 --> 26:05.480
But, you know, I wouldn't be surprised if Bernie Sanders begins to support

26:05.480 --> 26:08.480
a basic income of some sort coming soon,

26:08.480 --> 26:12.480
maybe in 2018 or certainly in 2020 if he considers another run.

26:12.480 --> 26:16.480
I know that there's certain kind of sympathies there.

26:16.480 --> 26:19.480
But has anyone actually said yea or nay? No.

26:19.480 --> 26:23.480
Right now, it seems the Democrats are too worried about the environmental consequences.

26:23.480 --> 26:26.480
And the Republicans are saying,

26:26.480 --> 26:30.480
well, why don't we just use the federal land and just let the country become richer?

26:30.480 --> 26:33.480
Do we really need to give it back to the poor?

26:33.480 --> 26:36.480
But the thing you have to understand about $150 trillion worth of federal land

26:36.480 --> 26:40.480
is that if you divide that by about 300 million Americans,

26:40.480 --> 26:42.480
that's a half million dollars each.

26:42.480 --> 26:46.480
Every single American individual basically in America should have

26:46.480 --> 26:49.480
approximately a half million dollar net worth.

26:49.480 --> 26:51.480
So this is a lot of money.

26:51.480 --> 26:55.480
I mean, over 50% of Americans don't have a net worth over $10,000.

26:55.480 --> 26:57.480
So when you talk about giving them a half million,

26:57.480 --> 27:01.480
you're talking about making their net worth 50 times what it is essentially.

27:01.480 --> 27:03.480
I mean, it's a dramatic change.

27:03.480 --> 27:05.480
We're talking about eliminating poverty.

27:05.480 --> 27:07.480
So all the parties are interested in it.

27:07.480 --> 27:09.480
And I've had some major things.

27:09.480 --> 27:13.480
I mean, now this future will have a major video out on it today or tomorrow.

27:13.480 --> 27:16.480
The Times of London did a big story where I was involved.

27:16.480 --> 27:17.480
It hasn't come out yet.

27:17.480 --> 27:19.480
But there's been quite a few things written about it.

27:19.480 --> 27:22.480
And I think it's going to continue growing.

27:22.480 --> 27:25.480
I was talking with HBO about it as well.

27:25.480 --> 27:28.480
But whether it's something that could be implemented,

27:28.480 --> 27:30.480
it's so tough in government.

27:30.480 --> 27:33.480
It takes forever to get these things through.

27:33.480 --> 27:35.480
Well, it's amazing to get rid of poverty.

27:35.480 --> 27:39.480
But the reality is that the current system in the U.S. seems to be extremely corrupt

27:39.480 --> 27:42.480
and extremely, as you said, religious and conservative.

27:42.480 --> 27:47.480
What everyday individual can do to change the system?

27:47.480 --> 27:49.480
Because the way I see it, the Constitution itself,

27:49.480 --> 27:52.480
it starts with saying, we the people, right?

27:52.480 --> 27:54.480
So people as this human people?

27:54.480 --> 27:57.480
Or are we talking about transhumans as people as well?

27:57.480 --> 28:00.480
So all these changes that you're following at some point

28:00.480 --> 28:03.480
will hit a brick wall because of the Constitution.

28:03.480 --> 28:09.480
So how can regular individuals, what can they do?

28:09.480 --> 28:12.480
And how can they approach this subject that will affect all of us

28:12.480 --> 28:16.480
in order to change the entire system fundamentally,

28:16.480 --> 28:18.480
which is absolutely needed?

28:18.480 --> 28:21.480
I mean, why should we be limited to a piece of document

28:21.480 --> 28:28.480
that's been written by feathers before discovery of electricity?

28:28.480 --> 28:29.480
Yes.

28:29.480 --> 28:32.480
No, I couldn't agree with you more.

28:32.480 --> 28:34.480
In my opinion, I've said this before,

28:34.480 --> 28:37.480
rewriting the Constitution is mandatory.

28:37.480 --> 28:40.480
People in the Libertarian Party get very upset when I say that,

28:40.480 --> 28:42.480
but I don't think they quite understand.

28:42.480 --> 28:45.480
Without rewriting the rules,

28:45.480 --> 28:47.480
the rules applied when America was a tiny nation,

28:47.480 --> 28:49.480
and there wasn't all this great technology.

28:49.480 --> 28:52.480
But now we have so many third parties, lobbyists,

28:52.480 --> 28:54.480
things that are creating corruption,

28:54.480 --> 29:00.480
I think it's absolutely imperative that we create a new system.

29:00.480 --> 29:02.480
It's okay to rewrite something.

29:02.480 --> 29:05.480
It's okay to say we can do better than we did two or 300 years ago.

29:05.480 --> 29:09.480
The question was asked that how do you monetize land?

29:09.480 --> 29:12.480
The monetizing thing is one of the most difficult questions,

29:12.480 --> 29:17.480
and this is where it really takes a lot of analysts and a lot of advisors

29:17.480 --> 29:19.480
that I'm kind of working on recruiting.

29:19.480 --> 29:23.480
For example, California, let's just stay with California

29:23.480 --> 29:24.480
as a good example right now,

29:24.480 --> 29:27.480
has an amazing amount of coastal land that has never been developed

29:27.480 --> 29:30.480
because the Coastal Commission in California is incredibly tight.

29:30.480 --> 29:34.480
Now, they've done a wonderful job protecting California to such a point

29:34.480 --> 29:36.480
that you can literally drive up and down the coast

29:36.480 --> 29:40.480
and not see houses for hours on end most times in many places.

29:40.480 --> 29:42.480
And while this is great,

29:42.480 --> 29:46.480
the fact of the matter is that the land overlooking the ocean

29:46.480 --> 29:50.480
for miles and miles and miles is worth trillions of dollars alone.

29:50.480 --> 29:53.480
I mean, we could take out 20%, 30% probably of the national debt

29:53.480 --> 29:56.480
just with the coastal land in California

29:56.480 --> 29:59.480
if we were to develop it and have people live there.

29:59.480 --> 30:01.480
But that's one way to monetize it.

30:01.480 --> 30:04.480
But then, of course, the environmental groups bring up other good problems.

30:04.480 --> 30:05.480
Okay, fine.

30:05.480 --> 30:08.480
In a year where California has enough water, that works fine.

30:08.480 --> 30:10.480
But what about the years when California has a drought?

30:10.480 --> 30:12.480
So it's complicated.

30:12.480 --> 30:15.480
It's not as easy as just say, okay, go to Exxon

30:15.480 --> 30:18.480
and go take over that five million acres of that forest

30:18.480 --> 30:20.480
and do what you want to it.

30:20.480 --> 30:23.480
In my leasing project, I never say...

30:23.480 --> 30:25.480
When I talk about monetizing federal land,

30:25.480 --> 30:28.480
I never want to give land away or sell it.

30:28.480 --> 30:30.480
I only talk about leasing land.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.480
So in my case, I would say to the forestry industry,

30:32.480 --> 30:35.480
we're going to give you five million acres of California timber,

30:35.480 --> 30:38.480
but in 25 years, you need to regrow it

30:38.480 --> 30:41.480
and return it to exactly the same state it was.

30:41.480 --> 30:46.480
And that's the only conditions that you can lease that land from us.

30:46.480 --> 30:48.480
And you're never going to own it.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.480
And should they default on that,

30:50.480 --> 30:52.480
then we would take over their companies or something like that.

30:52.480 --> 30:54.480
My plan only allows for leasing.

30:54.480 --> 30:56.480
And it also doesn't touch national parks.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.480
I made a comment about Yosemite earlier

30:58.480 --> 31:00.480
because everybody loves to joke about it when talking about this,

31:00.480 --> 31:02.480
but I would never touch national parks.

31:02.480 --> 31:06.480
Most of this land is, of course, not national parks of the federal land.

31:06.480 --> 31:08.480
So, you know, Nevada, for example,

31:08.480 --> 31:12.480
has some people say almost as many resources as Afghanistan

31:12.480 --> 31:14.480
when it concerns minerals.

31:14.480 --> 31:16.480
Now, we've been fighting trillion-dollar war in Afghanistan

31:16.480 --> 31:19.480
for a long time or at least, you know, protecting our interests.

31:19.480 --> 31:22.480
And you can say it's for the people, and I wish it was,

31:22.480 --> 31:24.480
but I don't really believe it is.

31:24.480 --> 31:26.480
I think it's for the mineral rights.

31:26.480 --> 31:31.480
Nevada is about 96% unoccupied, meaning most of the land is just empty,

31:31.480 --> 31:33.480
and we have huge mineral resources.

31:33.480 --> 31:36.480
When is the American government going to take those resources

31:36.480 --> 31:40.480
and use them for something that is actually applicable in today's world,

31:40.480 --> 31:42.480
especially fighting poverty?

31:42.480 --> 31:44.480
I mean, do they really think we're going to be sitting here

31:44.480 --> 31:46.480
in human flesh in 100 years?

31:46.480 --> 31:50.480
No, man, we're going to be something probably very different in 100 years.

31:50.480 --> 31:52.480
We have people starting to, to some extent,

31:52.480 --> 31:54.480
merge with machines, driverless cars.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.480
As soon as we're going to come five, 10 years,

31:56.480 --> 31:58.480
a bionic arm is going to be better than an arm of flesh.

31:58.480 --> 32:01.480
And, of course, Elon Musk is working on the neural lace

32:01.480 --> 32:04.480
along with other people, too, like the company colonel.

32:04.480 --> 32:08.480
The age of machines and merging with them is upon us.

32:08.480 --> 32:12.480
In 15 or 20 years, I don't expect really to be that human anymore.

32:12.480 --> 32:16.480
And what I'm trying to say is holding onto resources that we have

32:16.480 --> 32:18.480
and not just trying to give them to the highest bidder,

32:18.480 --> 32:20.480
at least in a leasing form, is crazy.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.480
And we're going to have nanotechnology,

32:22.480 --> 32:24.480
and we're going to have genetic engineering,

32:24.480 --> 32:26.480
we're going to have bioengineering,

32:26.480 --> 32:29.480
this great idea that you can control the weather and control nature.

32:29.480 --> 32:32.480
You know, China is already experimenting with controlling their weather,

32:32.480 --> 32:35.480
seeding the clouds with things so they can, you know,

32:35.480 --> 32:38.480
you can make rainstorms in Los Angeles when you need rain.

32:38.480 --> 32:40.480
The point is this is all right here.

32:40.480 --> 32:43.480
It's either happening or coming in the next five or 10 or 15 years.

32:43.480 --> 32:47.480
To sit on resources for some thousand-year future is insane to me.

32:47.480 --> 32:50.480
We have people that are hungry.

32:50.480 --> 32:52.480
We have people that have no education.

32:52.480 --> 32:54.480
We have people that have no health care.

32:54.480 --> 32:56.480
And they need these resources now.

32:56.480 --> 32:58.480
And honestly, it fundamentally belongs to them.

32:58.480 --> 32:59.480
It belongs to the people.

32:59.480 --> 33:02.480
So however we monetize it, we should monetize it.

33:02.480 --> 33:05.480
And, you know, I don't want to say let it be a free-for-all,

33:05.480 --> 33:07.480
because I don't want to ruin the Earth.

33:07.480 --> 33:11.480
I love the pristine beauty of the Earth, and I want to return to what it is.

33:11.480 --> 33:14.480
But I also don't want to see hungry children.

33:14.480 --> 33:16.480
That's unacceptable in America and elsewhere.

33:16.480 --> 33:20.480
And you see this monetization being done by the states,

33:20.480 --> 33:23.480
not the federal government, right?

33:23.480 --> 33:26.480
I think at first it would be best done by the states.

33:26.480 --> 33:29.480
I think states would have to decide if that's something that they want to do.

33:29.480 --> 33:33.480
But let's, you know, I think the strange thing here is that it's really only

33:33.480 --> 33:39.480
the western part of the United States that has massive amounts of federal resources.

33:39.480 --> 33:42.480
So at some point, it was a good experiment in California.

33:42.480 --> 33:44.480
It's an easy experiment.

33:44.480 --> 33:46.480
It's pretty certain to work here.

33:46.480 --> 33:49.480
It wouldn't work in Massachusetts or something or New York,

33:49.480 --> 33:51.480
because it doesn't have that many resources.

33:51.480 --> 33:54.480
And at some point, if you want to take this on a national level,

33:54.480 --> 33:58.480
which I think would be very important, then you would, you know,

33:58.480 --> 34:01.480
California would have to pay its share to the federal government.

34:01.480 --> 34:04.480
And that doesn't sit well as a California governor.

34:04.480 --> 34:07.480
But, you know, I'm also running on a national platform.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.480
I plan to run for the presidency again.

34:09.480 --> 34:13.480
I'm not sure when, but, you know, this will be a significant platform of mine.

34:13.480 --> 34:15.480
We are facing this age of automation.

34:15.480 --> 34:17.480
It's not going away.

34:17.480 --> 34:19.480
This is the question of our time.

34:19.480 --> 34:23.480
And I can tell you that if 30 or 40 percent of the workforce becomes unemployed

34:23.480 --> 34:26.480
and we can't pay them, they're going to pick up their guns and riot.

34:26.480 --> 34:31.480
And this could be the dystopia that, you know, I don't know, whoever was creating.

34:31.480 --> 34:32.480
But I don't want to see that.

34:32.480 --> 34:34.480
I don't want to be responsible for that.

34:34.480 --> 34:35.480
Right.

34:35.480 --> 34:39.480
I want to ask you about what are your plans for security,

34:39.480 --> 34:41.480
national security and cybersecurity?

34:41.480 --> 34:46.480
I mentioned briefly that one of the suggestions that you had was to chip

34:46.480 --> 34:48.480
the Syrian refugees that are coming.

34:48.480 --> 34:52.480
The reality is that we're dealing with terrorism on a daily basis.

34:52.480 --> 35:00.480
And it seems like a portion of the West being the far-left regressive liberals,

35:00.480 --> 35:04.480
whatever you want to call them, they're not even acknowledging the real problem.

35:04.480 --> 35:06.480
Are you acknowledging the real problem?

35:06.480 --> 35:11.480
And what are the solutions to deal with security based on the subject of terror

35:11.480 --> 35:13.480
and cybersecurity?

35:13.480 --> 35:14.480
Sure.

35:14.480 --> 35:18.480
And let me just clarify real quickly about the Syrian refugee chipping.

35:18.480 --> 35:21.480
I'm a former war zone journalist who has been to war zones.

35:21.480 --> 35:24.480
And I didn't say that because I actually wanted to chip refugees.

35:24.480 --> 35:27.480
I actually wouldn't do that if I had an open say.

35:27.480 --> 35:30.480
I would just let a lot of people in and not say anything

35:30.480 --> 35:33.480
because I have a kind of an open border policy.

35:33.480 --> 35:35.480
But my solution was bipartisan.

35:35.480 --> 35:38.480
I was saying, you know, neither the Democrats nor the conservatives

35:38.480 --> 35:41.480
want these people in, but is there any set of circumstances

35:41.480 --> 35:43.480
where they would want them in?

35:43.480 --> 35:46.480
And let's say chipping was a way we can monitor them.

35:46.480 --> 35:50.480
Well, now you're solving a humanitarian crisis while resting with a lot more

35:50.480 --> 35:53.480
security because you can follow these people through a central mainframe.

35:53.480 --> 35:56.480
And that was really that idea about chipping Syrian refugees.

35:56.480 --> 35:58.480
It wasn't something that I wanted to do.

35:58.480 --> 36:01.480
What I want to do is having been to war zones, seeing, you know,

36:01.480 --> 36:05.480
let's say 300,000 people have already died.

36:05.480 --> 36:07.480
What's important to me is saving lives.

36:07.480 --> 36:09.480
You know, as a transhumanist and a longevity activist,

36:09.480 --> 36:12.480
I don't believe in letting lives go.

36:12.480 --> 36:17.480
And there are methods, and those methods might seem totalitarian by nature,

36:17.480 --> 36:20.480
but it was not to keep them chipped forever.

36:20.480 --> 36:24.480
It was just like three years we let you in because your country's been destroyed

36:24.480 --> 36:27.480
by a dictator or whatever, and all of a sudden, you know,

36:27.480 --> 36:30.480
if you show you can produce and, you know, join the workforce

36:30.480 --> 36:33.480
or do whatever you're going to do here, then all of a sudden it's like,

36:33.480 --> 36:35.480
yeah, take your chip out and you're free to stay.

36:35.480 --> 36:38.480
And this was a humanitarian thing to save lives.

36:38.480 --> 36:43.480
And I broadly think that that's a good policy with immigration as well.

36:43.480 --> 36:47.480
I don't think that anyone should have free rein to just come into America

36:47.480 --> 36:49.480
because what if they don't do good things?

36:49.480 --> 36:53.480
However, I want to invite everyone in, and I want them to make America

36:53.480 --> 36:55.480
stronger and stronger and stronger.

36:55.480 --> 36:58.480
So what are some methods of making sure that they can do that?

36:58.480 --> 37:01.480
Well, there might be some technological methods like chipping

37:01.480 --> 37:05.480
or just heightened security or things like that that you can give immigrants here.

37:05.480 --> 37:09.480
I mean, let's be honest, the country was built on a strong immigrant population.

37:09.480 --> 37:11.480
I'm the son of an immigrant.

37:11.480 --> 37:17.480
And, you know, people came here wanting to live this American dream.

37:17.480 --> 37:22.480
I still believe broadly they do, but we just need to maybe use technology

37:22.480 --> 37:28.480
to make that a little bit more excessive, a little bit more so that the conservatives

37:28.480 --> 37:31.480
and the Democrats can swallow that without freaking out.

37:31.480 --> 37:35.480
And I think, you know, chipping technology is something that's great.

37:35.480 --> 37:37.480
I have a chip. It doesn't bother me, doesn't scare me.

37:37.480 --> 37:39.480
I use it for a lot of things.

37:39.480 --> 37:41.480
I think everyone's going to have one in the future.

37:41.480 --> 37:44.480
You know, what's the difference between a chip and a cell phone?

37:44.480 --> 37:47.480
Honestly, it's just not that big of a difference except one's tiny.

37:47.480 --> 37:50.480
And we're all being tracked by our cell phones already,

37:50.480 --> 37:52.480
whether they want to admit it or not.

37:52.480 --> 37:53.480
Facebook is tracking us.

37:53.480 --> 37:56.480
Skype is tracking this call for sure on my tablet.

37:56.480 --> 37:58.480
You know, all these different things are already happening.

37:58.480 --> 38:05.480
So I think the idea of privacy we might have to get over for the better benefit of security.

38:05.480 --> 38:07.480
What are we trying to hide from?

38:07.480 --> 38:08.480
I mean, I don't know.

38:08.480 --> 38:12.480
I mean, maybe it's like let everyone have as many guns as they want.

38:12.480 --> 38:16.480
Let everyone also be completely, you know, watch what they're doing.

38:16.480 --> 38:22.480
For me, I don't really understand why we're trying to retain privacy and retain rights.

38:22.480 --> 38:27.480
If we're going to live in a very public world with all this digital technology,

38:27.480 --> 38:32.480
we'd be safer to just be totally honest with ourselves and let a lot of our lives just be as it is,

38:32.480 --> 38:35.480
which is incredibly visible, incredibly trackable.

38:35.480 --> 38:40.480
And if we just allowed a bit more of that, I think life would get a lot more safe.

38:40.480 --> 38:43.480
And don't get me wrong, when it concerns government,

38:43.480 --> 38:46.480
more than ever I think President Trump should be wearing a thing

38:46.480 --> 38:49.480
that shows exactly where he is at every single moment.

38:49.480 --> 38:52.480
I think we should see all his discussions.

38:52.480 --> 38:56.480
Every single Congress, every single senator, every single politician should have something.

38:56.480 --> 39:00.480
If you want to be a public person, you should be on camera all the time.

39:00.480 --> 39:02.480
We should know exactly what you're doing.

39:02.480 --> 39:03.480
No backroom deals.

39:03.480 --> 39:04.480
We know you're lobbying.

39:04.480 --> 39:05.480
We hear that. We get you.

39:05.480 --> 39:09.480
This is the kind of society that I think is actually a lot more acceptable

39:09.480 --> 39:15.480
than the society where we all fight for our privacy and then we have bad things happen.

39:15.480 --> 39:21.480
Full transparency for everyone so nobody's basically missing out on it.

39:21.480 --> 39:26.480
Yes. And I think what people have to understand is we're moving towards a full transparent society.

39:26.480 --> 39:29.480
Whether we like it or not, this is happening.

39:29.480 --> 39:32.480
And you can fight it all you want.

39:32.480 --> 39:36.480
This is why as a libertarian it works very well to have a fully transparent society

39:36.480 --> 39:41.480
because then you have rights to everything you want to do, whatever it is you want to do.

39:41.480 --> 39:44.480
But you're also going to be, you know, the public can see you.

39:44.480 --> 39:46.480
People can know where you are.

39:46.480 --> 39:51.480
It sounds crazy, but it's a very libertarian-esque idea I think at the core of it.

39:51.480 --> 39:55.480
Yeah. It sounds very similar to what Eric Schmidt said,

39:55.480 --> 39:58.480
that if you're doing something that you don't want anybody else to know,

39:58.480 --> 40:00.480
maybe you shouldn't be doing that thing.

40:00.480 --> 40:02.480
I'm going to ask two more questions.

40:02.480 --> 40:06.480
The first one is from Luna Yeltsma.

40:06.480 --> 40:10.480
I hope that I haven't bastardized the name.

40:10.480 --> 40:17.480
He or she is asking, how do you see the concept of money and value evolve in the coming years and decades?

40:17.480 --> 40:23.480
And then I want to ask you because every time me and my friends are talking about policies of either of the parties,

40:23.480 --> 40:29.480
we get to the result that you have to follow the money and see who is funding them.

40:29.480 --> 40:32.480
Who is funding you?

40:32.480 --> 40:34.480
Are you asking me who's funding me?

40:34.480 --> 40:35.480
Sure.

40:35.480 --> 40:37.480
Well, I mean, I fund myself.

40:37.480 --> 40:40.480
I haven't taken donations from my governor run at all yet.

40:40.480 --> 40:45.480
It's entirely self-funded, your libertarian campaign and transhumanist campaign.

40:45.480 --> 40:48.480
Yes, so far entirely self-funded.

40:48.480 --> 40:52.480
We did take money for the transhumist party, but we never, this is embarrassing,

40:52.480 --> 40:57.480
we never even collected more than $5,000 over a two-year haul.

40:57.480 --> 41:04.480
The bus, though, the bus somebody we did, we had a kickstarter and that bus was for $27,000.

41:04.480 --> 41:08.480
But the bus was different because it paid for the bus and it paid for the food and the gas,

41:08.480 --> 41:12.480
the gas, for example, which was $7,000 to cross the country.

41:12.480 --> 41:17.480
So, yeah, nobody pays for my own political campaign, so at least not yet.

41:17.480 --> 41:18.480
I'd like to.

41:18.480 --> 41:23.480
I'm actually working on trying to see if the governor campaign can be quite different.

41:23.480 --> 41:26.480
I'm trying to work out managers and things like that.

41:26.480 --> 41:28.480
It really requires money up front.

41:28.480 --> 41:32.480
And then it'll be a very different question if you ask me this after I've done that.

41:32.480 --> 41:35.480
Because right now I can say anything I want.

41:35.480 --> 41:39.480
Party leadership, the libertarian party leadership came and told me already,

41:39.480 --> 41:42.480
be careful with the basic income, it's not our platform.

41:42.480 --> 41:44.480
And, you know, they warned me about it.

41:44.480 --> 41:49.480
But, you know, because I'm not beholden to anyone, I can kind of put those things forward.

41:49.480 --> 41:55.480
I do think, though, and I've said this before in my presidential run,

41:55.480 --> 41:59.480
I had no funding whatsoever, I just funded it myself,

41:59.480 --> 42:04.480
that we should either, it's okay to allow all money to go in the system,

42:04.480 --> 42:06.480
but if you're going to allow third-party candidates,

42:06.480 --> 42:12.480
maybe the government should have some kind of system that can promote some of the top third-party candidates

42:12.480 --> 42:15.480
to make sure that they have an equal playing field.

42:15.480 --> 42:21.480
It's in the best interest of the American people that the third-party candidates can be competitive

42:21.480 --> 42:26.480
against some of the top candidates who are working for all the corporations and getting all the lobbying money.

42:26.480 --> 42:29.480
And, you know, that just sounds fair to me.

42:29.480 --> 42:31.480
And even though I don't want government support,

42:31.480 --> 42:35.480
in the end of the day, if that's what makes it fair, that makes it fair.

42:35.480 --> 42:38.480
And if you can briefly answer Luna's question,

42:38.480 --> 42:43.480
how do you see the concept of money and value evolve in the coming years and decades?

42:43.480 --> 42:46.480
So it's very interesting watching what's happening with Bitcoin right now,

42:46.480 --> 42:53.480
you know, it's exploding on the market and whatnot, but whether it will continue to do so

42:53.480 --> 43:00.480
and become the currency of choice is a very, you know, that's a different game.

43:00.480 --> 43:05.480
I've often speculated, you know, what could be the real foundation of money in the future.

43:05.480 --> 43:11.480
I've often wondered, in fact, if DNA will end up as something like the real money of the future,

43:11.480 --> 43:15.480
or some kind of, maybe not DNA, maybe it's actually software or coding.

43:15.480 --> 43:17.480
It depends on what you're interested in.

43:17.480 --> 43:21.480
But the real future of money is that we're probably going to continue living underneath

43:21.480 --> 43:25.480
the American dollar, the whole world, for the next 10 or 20 years,

43:25.480 --> 43:30.480
unless some kind of electronic currency can become really powerful.

43:30.480 --> 43:35.480
But I think at some point, people might even try to tag the dollar to something electronic.

43:35.480 --> 43:37.480
And things will be so transparent,

43:37.480 --> 43:41.480
like Bitcoin will just transfer really into dollars and dollars into other things.

43:41.480 --> 43:45.480
We're not even sure that there will be one central currency.

43:45.480 --> 43:50.480
Value will always still be there, just very quick exchange rates.

43:50.480 --> 43:55.480
I have advocated for a central currency in my book and elsewhere,

43:55.480 --> 43:59.480
because I thought a single language and a single currency help bond people.

43:59.480 --> 44:02.480
But I'm not sure that that's actually ever going to happen,

44:02.480 --> 44:08.480
just given how fast technology changes and transfers just so instantaneous.

44:08.480 --> 44:11.480
It's crazy how quickly you can go get anything now.

44:11.480 --> 44:14.480
Right. And to conclude our conversation, Zoltan,

44:14.480 --> 44:18.480
then it's a proven fact that any innovation or development work

44:18.480 --> 44:23.480
as good as a society that adapts that development and innovation.

44:23.480 --> 44:26.480
How do you see us doing as a society?

44:26.480 --> 44:29.480
How good of a job are we doing adapting to new changes

44:29.480 --> 44:32.480
and educating ourselves about new changes?

44:32.480 --> 44:36.480
And what additional steps we can take just to catch up with the changes

44:36.480 --> 44:39.480
that are happening on a daily basis now?

44:39.480 --> 44:44.480
Yeah, we're sorry, but we're doing awful. We're terrible.

44:44.480 --> 44:47.480
It's amazing how backwards of a system we lived in.

44:47.480 --> 44:51.480
When I told you that 535 Congress members,

44:51.480 --> 44:53.480
nine Supreme Court justices, president, vice president,

44:53.480 --> 44:57.480
all believe in an afterlife, what I'm really saying is, are we kidding us?

44:57.480 --> 45:00.480
I mean, is this insane? This is truly insane.

45:00.480 --> 45:04.480
Now, if they all said, oh, well, you know, I have a broader definition of spirituality,

45:04.480 --> 45:08.480
I'd say fine. But we're talking like at least 95% of them would say

45:08.480 --> 45:12.480
something fundamental when it comes to religion or something like that.

45:12.480 --> 45:15.480
We live in a system that nobody wants to change

45:15.480 --> 45:19.480
because the power that they gathered was based on stepping on that system

45:19.480 --> 45:21.480
and preserving that system.

45:21.480 --> 45:24.480
And that's part of the reason how, you know, they got that power in the first place.

45:24.480 --> 45:27.480
I talk a lot about this in my book called baggage culture,

45:27.480 --> 45:29.480
where we carry our baggage with us everywhere.

45:29.480 --> 45:32.480
And sometimes the one who carries the most baggage

45:32.480 --> 45:34.480
actually ends up being the strongest person

45:34.480 --> 45:38.480
because he has the best amount of suitcases of baggage to step on.

45:38.480 --> 45:42.480
It's a sad story, whereas innovation, you have to struggle and fight.

45:42.480 --> 45:46.480
And you see someone even like me who comes into the movement with some new ideas

45:46.480 --> 45:50.480
even gets bashed in what's supposed to be a very progressive,

45:50.480 --> 45:52.480
very forward-thinking movement.

45:52.480 --> 45:57.480
So I'm very disappointed with how society is moving forward.

45:57.480 --> 46:01.480
And I wouldn't be surprised if something awful happens,

46:01.480 --> 46:06.480
either I'm pretty amazed right now that there hasn't been a terrible nuclear outbreak of some sort

46:06.480 --> 46:10.480
or whether it's a virus, something that takes out something or something else.

46:10.480 --> 46:15.480
You know, I mean, there are so many people out there that to me seem totally insane.

46:15.480 --> 46:21.480
And I'm amazed that more of them don't do bad things to harm society and harm the world.

46:21.480 --> 46:24.480
And I think a lot of it comes from the fact that we're not adjusting

46:24.480 --> 46:26.480
to how fast technology is progressing.

46:26.480 --> 46:29.480
And at some point, it's just going to leave us totally behind.

46:29.480 --> 46:33.480
You know, when inequality grows, that's a problem.

46:33.480 --> 46:36.480
It's growing because nobody can keep up.

46:36.480 --> 46:42.480
We need to make sure that all the levels of the population stay in harmony and work together.

46:42.480 --> 46:50.480
And that democracy is something that we don't have just because it makes sense or because it's useful.

46:50.480 --> 46:54.480
We have it because we don't want to face the alternative of democracy.

46:54.480 --> 46:58.480
And unless you've been to war zones, you forget what that alternative is like.

46:58.480 --> 47:02.480
That alternative is somebody comes in, rapes your wife, kills your children,

47:02.480 --> 47:03.480
and then buries you in the backyard.

47:03.480 --> 47:04.480
That's the alternative.

47:04.480 --> 47:07.480
I think a lot of people forget that or haven't seen that,

47:07.480 --> 47:10.480
especially our generation as a younger amount of Americans and Canadians

47:10.480 --> 47:14.480
who may not have been off to war recently.

47:14.480 --> 47:19.480
And with that, ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for Zoltanistan.

47:19.480 --> 47:21.480
Thank you.

47:21.480 --> 47:23.480
So...

47:27.480 --> 47:28.480
Oh, yeah.

47:28.480 --> 47:30.480
I asked Zoltan that before the first time he was.

47:30.480 --> 47:33.480
Let me just ask you the last question I ask everybody,

47:33.480 --> 47:37.480
that if you come across an intelligent alien from a different civilization,

47:37.480 --> 47:41.480
what would you say is the worst thing humanity has done,

47:41.480 --> 47:51.480
and what would you say is humanity's greatest achievement?

47:53.480 --> 47:57.480
Well, look, I think the greatest achievement would say would be that

47:57.480 --> 48:01.480
we have discovered love.

48:01.480 --> 48:04.480
I think love is very important in terms of democracy,

48:04.480 --> 48:10.480
in terms of ideologies of why we do things like come together and want to help.

48:10.480 --> 48:13.480
Without this mammalian idea of wanting to help one another,

48:13.480 --> 48:18.480
empathy and compassion, then I think we would be out to lunch.

48:18.480 --> 48:20.480
This is going to be one of the biggest challenges

48:20.480 --> 48:23.480
about teaching machines and artificial intelligence.

48:23.480 --> 48:27.480
How do you actually get a robot to love something and really love it,

48:27.480 --> 48:29.480
like want to defend it, want to give up its life for it,

48:29.480 --> 48:32.480
want to do some of these different things?

48:32.480 --> 48:41.480
I think the worst thing that we have done as a society,

48:41.480 --> 48:45.480
I don't mean to bash religion, but I'm going to just say,

48:45.480 --> 48:48.480
I think the worst thing we've done recently,

48:48.480 --> 48:50.480
at least in the last few millennia,

48:50.480 --> 48:53.480
is that we've formalized religion to such a point

48:53.480 --> 48:57.480
that it's now become our outlook on everything in life.

48:57.480 --> 48:59.480
You cannot wake up in the morning in America

48:59.480 --> 49:03.480
and I salute the flag under God or it's on our money.

49:03.480 --> 49:07.480
It's everywhere. Our biggest holidays are about Jesus.

49:07.480 --> 49:12.480
It's insane to me that our biggest holidays are not about scientists

49:12.480 --> 49:16.480
or about innovation, things that have changed people's lives.

49:16.480 --> 49:20.480
The guy who made IVF, now we have 4 million extra babies

49:20.480 --> 49:23.480
because an innovator out there said,

49:23.480 --> 49:26.480
you know what, we can do test tube babies, we can create more life.

49:26.480 --> 49:29.480
These should be the holidays that we celebrate as national holidays.

49:29.480 --> 49:33.480
And unfortunately, we live in a country in a western world

49:33.480 --> 49:38.480
so very Judeo-Christian that I worry it's been holding back innovation

49:38.480 --> 49:39.480
for a long time.

49:39.480 --> 49:42.480
It's not that it needs to be fundamentally atheist at all.

49:42.480 --> 49:44.480
No, I wouldn't want that either.

49:44.480 --> 49:47.480
But I just feel like America, like I said,

49:47.480 --> 49:49.480
our entire government believes in an afterlife.

49:49.480 --> 49:51.480
No wonder they don't care about transhumanism.

49:51.480 --> 49:54.480
No wonder they don't care about living far longer

49:54.480 --> 49:56.480
because they believe there's an afterlife out there

49:56.480 --> 49:59.480
and they're going to be singing with angels as soon as they die.

49:59.480 --> 50:26.480
You know, I don't believe that at all.

50:29.480 --> 50:33.480
.
