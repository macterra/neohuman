WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.720
As Nietzsche says, when we walked away from when God was dead, all of a sudden, there was a vacuum

00:06.720 --> 00:14.800
in our society, and it got filled with totalitarian regimes of Europe of the early 1900s, and

00:14.800 --> 00:23.360
communism made sure it squished anything left of Christianity. So Christianity is still going

00:23.360 --> 00:32.640
strong. Christianity is being revived. Oh, I hear that, but not amongst... I suspect you're

00:32.640 --> 00:41.440
not going to find a lot of Christians amongst the CRTs or the environmentalists. No, they're

00:41.440 --> 00:53.840
against. They have their own religion. That's right. It is a religion, yeah.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.520
You ever watch UnHerd, the British fellow, young lad who does talk shows out of the UK? I don't

01:01.520 --> 01:09.360
think so. He's quite interesting, and he's fairly balanced, and he went to Austria the day before

01:09.360 --> 01:14.720
yesterday and walked around and started interviewing people. Isn't that where Hitler is from?

01:17.440 --> 01:23.840
Well, I tell you, the people he interviewed in the street, it blew me away. It could have been 1930,

01:23.840 --> 01:31.200
and it could be locking up a whole different group of people. It was the same ethos. I mean,

01:31.200 --> 01:36.400
people were angry and saying they should be locked in their home. They shouldn't be allowed out

01:36.400 --> 01:43.040
until they're vaccinated. It's like, wow. Same in Canada, though, don't you think?

01:46.240 --> 01:56.480
No. Well, again, Toronto's damaged, socially damaged for obvious reasons. Out here where I am,

01:56.480 --> 02:07.920
it's people are way more laid back and really question what they're being told.

02:12.800 --> 02:17.680
Yeah, this next wave is going to be interesting if they make all the kids. I was talking to a

02:17.680 --> 02:25.440
friend who teaches up north, and she has a JK and a kindergarten class, and JK don't require

02:25.440 --> 02:31.680
masks, but the kindergarten kids do. Half the kids in her class have masks and the other kids don't.

02:31.680 --> 02:36.720
How does that make sense? Yeah. We don't know the long-term effect of any of it,

02:37.520 --> 02:44.480
including wearing a mask all day. Agreed. Well, I know if I'm gone to the store and I've been

02:44.480 --> 02:54.160
wearing a mask, my nose feels funny and I don't feel good because you're recirculating your own

02:54.160 --> 03:00.320
air. It'd be interesting to look at your blood chemistry after a day of wearing a mask and see

03:00.320 --> 03:04.720
if the CO2 levels are up and other harmful things are higher in your blood than if you breathe

03:04.720 --> 03:07.920
regular air. God forbid anybody do that research.

03:11.680 --> 03:18.080
Well, the trouble is they have, it's just not available readily. A buddy of mine was complaining

03:18.080 --> 03:22.880
about no research was being done and it's all Vax. Well, I went to the University of Florida

03:22.880 --> 03:29.600
and they have a database of well over 600 current research projects that are going on right now

03:30.160 --> 03:33.920
of all different components. What are the, you know, what preventative maintenance,

03:33.920 --> 03:37.440
what upfront steps you'd be doing, what should happen if a person comes in later,

03:37.440 --> 03:44.080
comes in early to the hospital with symptoms, various different, all that research is being done

03:45.360 --> 03:52.160
but no one's willing to talk about it. That's what I find so sad. I found a great little

03:52.160 --> 04:01.200
video from Carl Sagan did in the 80s interview with Charlie Rose and it's, he nails it way back

04:01.200 --> 04:06.720
then that our whole society has given up on science and science means listening to all

04:06.720 --> 04:14.320
aspects of the discussion and putting all the cards on the table and, you know, and he pointed

04:14.320 --> 04:18.960
out that no one in government has any science knowledge or skills and the science departments

04:18.960 --> 04:24.640
directly asked for most of the government departments at the judicial level and

04:26.320 --> 04:34.400
people aren't making good decisions. Yeah, I don't know. I keep, you know, I keep asking the doc,

04:34.400 --> 04:39.360
what do you think? And she keeps telling me, she said, Wally, we do not have enough information

04:39.360 --> 04:46.480
to do anything useful yet. She went through SARS in Toronto and she saw how long it took to sort

04:46.480 --> 04:52.880
that out and figure out what was really going on and it broke her heart to see people at the window

04:52.880 --> 04:58.400
looking at their dying parents, right? But they weren't allowed to go in and see them.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.880
Yeah, we don't think we got this right at all. No, I understand why last spring, why we locked down

05:08.880 --> 05:18.640
on because we had no idea what we're up against and the CCP wasn't giving us anything useful,

05:18.640 --> 05:26.160
wasn't sharing information. And I think everyone was assuming this is much, much worse than it

05:26.160 --> 05:35.120
turned out. Yeah, that's how it was presented. Well, and don't let, don't let it go to waste.

05:35.120 --> 05:42.480
You know, some people made the best out of this. But they denied it came from Wuhan.

05:42.480 --> 05:49.680
They still do. Except for, well, I think the UN has acknowledged it came from Wuhan,

05:49.680 --> 05:57.360
so that's something I guess. I think because anything terrible that happens, I think there is a

05:59.200 --> 06:04.080
opposite side of that that is happening or will happen as a result of it. You know, the

06:04.080 --> 06:09.280
Newton's third law of motion for every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction.

06:10.320 --> 06:18.160
So COVID terrible, but at the same time, it exposed all these institutions for what they really are

06:19.840 --> 06:26.720
that yes, science is gone to a large degree because we're not even asking the right questions.

06:26.720 --> 06:34.960
All of our questions are sponsored by this or that, this pharma, that big tech, you know,

06:34.960 --> 06:39.120
that beer company or whatever, you know, any kind of advertisement that is shown in

06:40.400 --> 06:45.840
news channels. And they have, they all basically have the same kind of a political agenda.

06:46.640 --> 06:53.040
And if it wasn't because of internet, they already had taken over the lives of all the people. It's

06:53.040 --> 07:01.760
just, you know, it's this democratized technology that allows people to speak out basically to

07:01.760 --> 07:08.400
fight back. But some people don't. Some people don't fight back. And some people are delighted,

07:08.400 --> 07:16.480
like you said, like 1930s masks to a large degree, I think has the same function for a lot of people

07:16.480 --> 07:23.520
that swastika is that, that it's a status symbol that, Hey, I am, I am with you. I belong to the

07:23.520 --> 07:31.600
right tribe. I'm with this powerful, right? So that's a evolutionary psychology makes a lot of

07:31.600 --> 07:41.200
sense. But then because of the form of our governance, we are doomed to deal with whatever

07:41.200 --> 07:46.720
the so-called majority that in Canada, for example, has completely rigged that system,

07:46.720 --> 07:52.000
that whoever gets the vote of downtown Toronto and downtown Montreal, they win it. Well,

07:52.000 --> 07:59.200
obvious. It's very obvious what's happening, you know? Yeah, agree. So yeah, I don't know

07:59.200 --> 08:05.280
what's going to happen, but I think what is very obvious is that we have completely left behind

08:05.280 --> 08:12.080
our technology, our tools, and nobody has any kind of a solution. And the power vacuum that has

08:12.960 --> 08:18.240
been created as a result of that is bringing a lot of different tribes, you know, they're

08:18.240 --> 08:25.520
deforming again, they're making new alliances. And this is a, this is a war for power and who

08:25.520 --> 08:33.200
sets the narrative, which direction and you know, the options are very radically different. So

08:33.200 --> 08:38.640
that's, that's why nothing makes sense really, because nothing is being said for the sake of

08:38.640 --> 08:45.120
the truth. Everything is being said for the sake of winning this war. Well,

08:47.520 --> 08:52.240
the fact that the Democrats said they wouldn't take any vaccines that were developed by Trump,

08:54.000 --> 09:00.080
and now they're surprised when the other side is reluctant to take, you know, to do what Biden's

09:00.080 --> 09:10.080
saying. I mean, it's, it's so people can't seem to parse out the politics from what needs to get

09:10.080 --> 09:14.960
done, or what works and what doesn't work or the science. I mean, well, the science is not even

09:14.960 --> 09:21.200
part of it. It's just, it all gets polarized around the politics. And that should be the last place

09:23.200 --> 09:26.560
that we should hang our hat, you know, for anything like this.

09:26.560 --> 09:33.520
I mean, I, yeah, I mean, the men in white coats shouldn't be telling us what, you know, what to

09:33.520 --> 09:39.200
do either, but they can provide guidance, but then you muzzle half of them, because they're not

09:39.200 --> 09:44.240
fitting the political narrative and it all gets. And then people just get further and further

09:44.240 --> 09:49.920
entrenched in their camps. And none of this is useful. It's quite destructive. And as you're

09:49.920 --> 09:55.680
saying, it becomes tribal. I agree. I drop in on your podcast and quite enjoyed it. And I think

09:55.680 --> 10:01.040
asked and quite enjoy them. I'm just amazed that the people that you managed to get a hold of,

10:01.040 --> 10:06.160
it's just wonderful. It's the work of the universe. I supposed to be talking to them, I guess

10:09.200 --> 10:14.160
I'm wrapping it up. I'm probably going to do like maybe two, three more episodes,

10:14.160 --> 10:21.680
because I think this, the entire mood of the world is very different than having conversations.

10:21.680 --> 10:27.920
People who already have the base to have these long form conversations. I think all the focus

10:27.920 --> 10:33.520
needs to be on those people. And the rest is basically it's, it's not even time for

10:33.520 --> 10:40.720
mobilizations, time for action for people. And so, you know, I'm, I'm going to wrap it up,

10:40.720 --> 10:45.600
I think, and I'm going to make a book out of it. Just listen to the episodes with people who I

10:45.600 --> 10:51.280
still enjoy that they were on the podcast and then, you know, transcribe it and see what part

10:51.280 --> 10:56.880
of it is interesting and then see if some kind of a pattern emerges to make some kind of like a arc.

11:00.560 --> 11:04.320
That's a neat idea. I like that. And then the audio book basically would be

11:05.280 --> 11:09.040
the exact selection of those from the podcast itself.

11:09.040 --> 11:19.520
Pretty cool. Who did you listen to? Which episodes? The last one.

11:25.200 --> 11:31.120
I can't remember his name now. You were talking about AI and alternate universes.

11:31.120 --> 11:41.120
Yes. Yeah. That was, I mean, I didn't understand a lot of it, but it was sort of cool that the

11:41.120 --> 11:46.240
conversations being had at all. Right. I think it's really neat. Yeah. And he came back. I mean,

11:46.240 --> 11:53.040
very often I took. Nice. Yeah. That was the second time. And it's not like Google does you

11:53.040 --> 12:02.320
any favors on the YouTube channel. No, too much Trump supporting and like this is the wrong guy

12:02.320 --> 12:12.080
to have any kind of an audience. I find that so frightening. I mean, that is so, that is so the

12:12.080 --> 12:19.280
CCP model being enacted over here. I mean, they silence the sitting president of the United States.

12:19.280 --> 12:26.240
So anybody else, they can silence. I still can't believe that. I still am absolutely gobsmacked

12:26.240 --> 12:32.320
that that was allowed. That was a point in history that everything, you know, nothing could have

12:32.320 --> 12:39.920
returned after that point on, because it's like all of this stuff essentially are imaginary

12:39.920 --> 12:46.560
contracts, social contracts between people. Right. The entire, it's a reason that like

12:46.560 --> 12:52.640
Supreme Court building looks so epic. Right. Because if they were in a pizza parlor,

12:53.200 --> 13:02.720
nobody cared like what they have to say. So once it's broken, that, you know, Wizard of Oz,

13:04.000 --> 13:09.680
once people see behind the curtain, then it, you know, you can't really unknow that.

13:09.680 --> 13:19.280
Yeah, that, I don't think social media understood the consequences of their actions. People are

13:19.280 --> 13:28.160
leaving in a big way. So the only hope he has now is to set up his virtual reality environment.

13:28.160 --> 13:29.120
Oh, Zuckerberg.

13:29.120 --> 13:40.160
Continue to reel in the lost generation of people that all they do is online play games and bring

13:40.160 --> 13:45.840
those in and keep brainwashing them. I even think they're diverse enough that they won't fall for

13:45.840 --> 13:49.520
it. So I don't. Yeah, but at the same time, the money's leading Facebook. At the same time,

13:50.240 --> 13:55.440
they're about to release their own coin. DM. DM.

13:55.440 --> 14:02.800
Yes. So it's going to be a centralized coin. It will be a centralized coin. So in well,

14:02.800 --> 14:08.960
that's, that's pointless. Well, the thing is they're going to connect that to Metaverse.

14:10.320 --> 14:15.440
Now, the good thing, good news is that at the same time, we have decentralization and Web3

14:15.440 --> 14:21.600
and all of these stuff is happening. So the alternative that is being built is open source.

14:21.600 --> 14:28.400
It's decentralized. It's accessible to everybody. So he has a tough competition.

14:29.200 --> 14:34.880
But at the same time, he can still take over a lot of aspects of society. You know, you imagine

14:34.880 --> 14:42.080
that the entire institutions of the government or the culture will be rebuilt in Zuckerberg's

14:42.080 --> 14:47.680
Metaverse with the values that he wants to push. And we do know what kind of values he wants to push.

14:47.680 --> 14:54.480
Wants to be just like China. Yeah, I think he only hit only him in charge himself to basically be

14:55.360 --> 15:02.400
become god of that reality. Because that's exactly what it is. It will be a additional layer,

15:02.400 --> 15:08.560
ultimately, on this reality, and it will be augmented reality. It could be contact lens,

15:08.560 --> 15:15.840
it could be the, it could be the, it could be the, it could be the, it could be the, it could be the

15:15.840 --> 15:23.840
the computer, a brain computer interface, like Neuralink, that you run that application on top

15:23.840 --> 15:29.200
of it. So you have basically a subjective customized experience of reality based on

15:30.400 --> 15:37.440
what you've built on top of it. AR. How have you been, David?

15:37.440 --> 15:44.400
I've been pretty well. All things in Toronto.

15:46.960 --> 15:52.320
So Toronto, as I'm hearing, because Fritz was just talking about that you guys went to a pub,

15:53.040 --> 15:56.720
Toronto is not in lockdown or anything like that currently.

15:56.720 --> 16:06.080
Just partial lockdown. Where are the places that are in lockdown?

16:09.360 --> 16:16.160
I mean, like the private businesses are still quite restricted. Like you need a

16:17.440 --> 16:22.560
a vaccine passport to get into theaters. They already run the vaccine passport in Toronto?

16:22.560 --> 16:27.120
Yeah. That's really messed up.

16:31.280 --> 16:37.120
It is if you're not vaccinated for sure. How many, what percentage of Toronto is not vaccinated?

16:39.520 --> 16:42.000
I'm not sure. I would guess

16:42.000 --> 16:52.160
like 10 or 20%. Those are the ones that are on the bus towards the camps,

16:55.440 --> 16:56.400
vaccine camps.

17:00.720 --> 17:04.640
Who's going to enforce it if you're wandering around or it's just when you're accessing anything

17:04.640 --> 17:10.320
if it gets enforced, right? Yeah, you can wander around for sure.

17:10.320 --> 17:17.120
In Austria, they're going around. Cops are going around and asking for vaccine passport.

17:20.800 --> 17:27.040
I need the papers. Show me your papers, sir. You will sign the papers. Yep.

17:27.920 --> 17:33.520
They should go all over again. Those guys look like they're almost in riot gear.

17:33.520 --> 17:45.040
Like in Australia. But Austria also put the lockdown for only unvaccinated across country.

17:47.120 --> 17:54.240
New York, for example, that they do have vaccine passport is something like 70% of African American

17:54.240 --> 18:01.840
population of New York, they're not vaccinated. So basically an apartheid, you know, it's a two

18:01.840 --> 18:11.760
tier system in New York right now. And you know, it's happening. People are like, Oh, no, people

18:11.760 --> 18:20.160
are waking up, but I don't think they're waking up fast enough. Well, what's it like in Florida?

18:20.160 --> 18:26.240
Florida is amazing. I was just telling Fritz, I'm very blessed. This governor is just the best.

18:26.240 --> 18:35.600
You know, it's not like, not only that he's not bending the knee, he's like firing back 10 fold.

18:36.800 --> 18:42.640
So we've been on the offensive and our numbers are pretty low. I think it's the lowest or second

18:42.640 --> 18:49.760
lowest in the country now. And California and New York, they're exploding again. But, you know,

18:49.760 --> 18:56.400
it seems like a lot of people, I don't say the majority, but enough people, they don't care

18:56.400 --> 19:02.480
about data, about evidence, about facts. Because there are still like on Twitter, there are people

19:02.480 --> 19:08.480
like, Oh, Florida, everybody's dying, numbers are out of control. Like, dude, we live here, we it's

19:08.480 --> 19:17.920
not like that. Like, no, no, no, you're just lying. Russian puppet or whatever. So, you know, this is

19:17.920 --> 19:23.920
a seems like it's a bigger problem that part of the mentality of part of the society is broken

19:23.920 --> 19:32.160
permanently. And, you know, they're living in a different kind of a reality, which is a set

19:32.160 --> 19:38.000
narrative by the authority, you know, whether media or politicians or their leaders, basically.

19:38.000 --> 19:47.360
And their leaders basically. Well, the legacy media in Canada underwrites that notion that,

19:47.360 --> 19:52.480
you know, places like Texas and Florida, people are dying in the streets. It's like a Monty Python

19:52.480 --> 20:01.600
sketch, bring out your dead. Is that what they're saying? Well, they're very careful how it's worded

20:01.600 --> 20:07.920
and how it's framed because you know, but the subtext that people are getting up here is, yeah,

20:07.920 --> 20:14.080
it's not good. Mind you, everyone I know that bugs out of this area, goes to Florida is gone.

20:14.960 --> 20:20.400
So anyone that has, you know, residences in Florida that they use in the winter,

20:20.400 --> 20:25.600
they've all left the minute they opened the border, the US were letting Canadians in,

20:25.600 --> 20:37.280
bang, everyone, they're dead. They're down there now. Oh, yeah, clearly. It's, it's, yeah, it's so,

20:38.000 --> 20:41.600
but again, it has nothing to do with, as you said, it's not to do with science and facts,

20:41.600 --> 20:49.360
it's all politics. So you have to underwrite the narrative that's the meme of the day in Canada,

20:49.360 --> 20:56.960
and everyone gathers around the bonfire and burns any of the witches that aren't following

20:56.960 --> 21:04.160
the prescribed narrative. It's quite bizarre. And it's insidious, because it's never emphatically

21:04.160 --> 21:12.720
stated. It's sort of implied if you read the text and read what's being said. It's, yeah, very clever.

21:12.720 --> 21:19.280
It's something you'd expect from the Politburo. I think they would have succeeded if we did

21:19.280 --> 21:30.000
and have the internet. You know, because, you know, they had very limited channels of communication

21:30.000 --> 21:37.520
before internet, and they were monopolized. So the kind of news that was being told to people

21:37.520 --> 21:45.440
as news, it was all tailored basically, and fine tuned to maintain some kind of a narrative,

21:45.440 --> 21:49.840
you know, and the newspaper is the same way, they were limited ones, they're all owned by

21:49.840 --> 21:56.400
a small group of people. But the internet, you know, democratized this ability for, you know,

21:56.400 --> 22:07.680
anybody who has any kind of a device to create and share information, right? Now this disrupted

22:07.680 --> 22:15.840
the entire notion of truth. What is the truth? You know, what is the meaning of it? If words

22:16.800 --> 22:23.440
can be misinterpreted, quote unquote, it means that they were meant to be misinterpreted.

22:23.440 --> 22:29.760
Otherwise, if they're solid by design, by their nature, then you cannot change their definitions.

22:30.400 --> 22:37.120
So these are all manmade contracts that we've, you know, we've carried on with using these

22:37.120 --> 22:44.880
tools for many centuries. And now we have the ability to question the very fundamental of it,

22:44.880 --> 22:53.920
that hey, you say good, I disagree with your definition of good. Right? That's a far deeper

22:53.920 --> 23:01.600
and bigger fight war over meanings and definitions that I think is only possible because of internet.

23:01.600 --> 23:09.200
Otherwise, people that didn't have this megaphone, you know, the term I use machine guns, monkeys

23:09.200 --> 23:16.080
with machine guns, we can't we can't even comprehend the power of this, you know, but we use it because

23:16.080 --> 23:25.120
it's amazing. So how far back do you have to go in history before you find a new kind of media

23:25.120 --> 23:32.080
that had a similar change on society? Probably. No.

23:35.600 --> 23:38.640
What do you think Martin Luther and I mean, that was, yeah,

23:38.640 --> 23:44.400
that's what I was thinking. Like the printing press disrupted society at a fundamental level,

23:44.400 --> 23:51.280
because in a similar way of decentralizing the dissemination of information and having

23:51.280 --> 23:56.000
competing sources of truth. The church lost the monopoly.

23:57.120 --> 24:03.840
Yeah, so it's truth. But with small t, because if there is if there is capital T truth,

24:03.840 --> 24:09.280
then it's available to everybody at any time anywhere. You know, it does not require any

24:09.280 --> 24:14.960
kind of knowledge or you know, you train the certain way or meditate for a certain amount.

24:14.960 --> 24:22.400
No, it's just like, it's like sunlight. If it's absolute. If it's not absolute,

24:22.400 --> 24:29.760
what is the point of it? So if we if it is, I should have said narrative for the truth,

24:29.760 --> 24:37.840
we lost control. But if we move on from inaccessibility of capital T truth, then

24:39.440 --> 24:44.240
we're in the next phase of Okay, we tried postmodernism, but postmodernism that has

24:44.240 --> 24:49.600
been enforced through objective means, you cannot say that everything is subjective,

24:49.600 --> 24:53.200
except what I'm saying, you have to take that objectively. It's like oxymoronic.

24:54.560 --> 25:00.960
Right. And now we're taking this to the next level. We have metaverse, we have virtual reality,

25:00.960 --> 25:06.960
and we can customize our own reality based on that it seems like it all goes according to some kind

25:06.960 --> 25:15.600
of a plan. Isn't it the perfect timing of everything? The doc just keeps telling me that

25:15.600 --> 25:21.120
men are just too stupid to pull something like that off of serendipity and bad luck.

25:22.400 --> 25:28.400
So I don't know. I mean, there you go. There's the the other framing of it. But I think I think

25:28.400 --> 25:34.400
people took advantage of the situation big time. It played into the hands of a lot of global actors.

25:34.400 --> 25:44.480
And that's scary. So if even if if they didn't precipitate it, they, they amplified it and

25:45.440 --> 25:50.720
went with it. I just that interviewer talked about earlier in Austria, people in the street,

25:50.720 --> 25:59.120
I mean, the meme still works. I mean, the in a society, like in European societies were,

25:59.120 --> 26:08.720
I guess the only word I can use is racist generally. That they're quite uncomfortable with

26:08.720 --> 26:12.480
anything that doesn't fit in with whatever narrative they've created around themselves.

26:13.280 --> 26:17.200
I think we're still better here in North America that way. Canada, maybe less so.

26:17.200 --> 26:25.120
US is still there's lots of stuff on the table. And as you're saying, in spite of efforts by,

26:25.120 --> 26:30.640
you know, the social media companies and the government, there's still a lot of different

26:30.640 --> 26:38.160
truths and narratives on the table available to us. I don't know how true that is in Europe.

26:40.160 --> 26:45.120
Well, apparently, there are protests all over Europe by media. Media isn't covering it.

26:47.040 --> 26:52.480
Yes, I gather that I watched some, some of the guys I watch are posting that stuff.

26:52.480 --> 27:00.480
Some of the guys I watch are posting that stuff. So, but the problem is that in countries like

27:00.480 --> 27:08.160
Austria, a lot of the protests are, it's the extreme right, it's the vestigial remains of,

27:08.160 --> 27:13.200
you know, the Newton's third law of motion for every action, there is an equal and opposite

27:13.200 --> 27:21.680
reaction. We went way too far left. And people, you know, I don't know how closely you guys are

27:21.680 --> 27:28.960
following politics in the US. But what happened in this election series of elections, like two

27:28.960 --> 27:33.920
weeks ago, or something like that, is just mind blowing. And now New York Times and Economist

27:33.920 --> 27:40.480
are all coming with pieces that this Democrats are going to get owned in the midterm elections.

27:41.200 --> 27:46.160
But are you talking about the recent election? Yeah, Virginia was one of them, but also like

27:46.160 --> 27:52.160
New Jersey, which is supposed to be like, you know, establishments playground, basically,

27:53.120 --> 28:00.000
a truck driver won over I think the Speaker of the House or President of the Senate of New Jersey,

28:00.000 --> 28:09.120
and he spent only $156. Because people are voting for a piece of crap over establishment people.

28:09.120 --> 28:15.200
Now people are done with them. But you know, they're not going to go go down without fighting.

28:15.200 --> 28:21.600
They're just like, okay, here's the power. So it's gonna be really insane. With all deep fakes and

28:21.600 --> 28:27.840
stuff. I can't even imagine how the next election cycle for president is going to be. You know,

28:27.840 --> 28:36.080
the Kyle Rittenhouse trial, they apparently doctored one video that is problematic right now.

28:36.080 --> 28:44.240
And they use AI and machine learning to like, supposedly enhance it. But they like altered

28:44.240 --> 28:54.800
the photo basically, or altered the image. I saw the video that the one presented by the prosecution

28:54.800 --> 29:03.440
was much worse quality than the one that they had in hand, because it was, it didn't actually

29:03.440 --> 29:08.720
support their case. It's insane. I mean, the fact that that trial is even happening is just,

29:09.360 --> 29:13.280
you know, a very sign that this entire system is broken really badly.

29:14.240 --> 29:18.960
Well, why don't you think it should happen? Because it's very clear it was self defense.

29:20.880 --> 29:27.120
No, that's what he's on trial for. It's determined whether it was self defense. I have no problem

29:27.120 --> 29:33.760
with him being on trial since he did actually kill two people. But I agree it was likely self

29:33.760 --> 29:41.360
defense, but you can't prove that or even show that with a video trial. Oh, you can't have the

29:41.360 --> 29:46.960
yeah, sure, but you can't have the police being the judiciary and saying,

29:48.480 --> 29:55.360
But you wind this back to the 60s and the government been pinning medals on Kyle Rittenhouse.

29:55.360 --> 30:02.240
Kyle Rittenhouse. There's something hugely changed in the whole social atmosphere and

30:02.240 --> 30:09.440
I mean, if Rittenhouse was an Antifa or Black Lives Matter, there would not be any kind of a trial.

30:11.680 --> 30:20.320
I agree. So it's not like the justice system is working in an unbiased kind of a way.

30:20.320 --> 30:31.920
He is, you know, he's like the bait that media is using to get more attention. It's so evil

30:31.920 --> 30:40.240
what these people are doing. Like a lot of people didn't even a lot of people on the left are being

30:40.240 --> 30:46.400
shocked by how much they were misled in the months leading up to the trial by the media that they

30:46.400 --> 30:54.320
trusted. And the media is still doing it. Yeah, you see the judge banned MSNBC from the

30:56.160 --> 31:02.000
and but like, yeah, I'm just shocked when you read CNN and you look at what they're saying

31:02.000 --> 31:09.200
about the trial and then you actually watch the trial. There's a total disconnect. It's utter,

31:09.200 --> 31:19.280
it's bizarre world. If you look at the viewership of past Sunday, they released every Sunday is like

31:19.280 --> 31:25.440
the most viewed programs on each network. At the first 15 or something like that, they're all Fox

31:25.440 --> 31:36.000
News. So the first MSNBC or CNN, they're not even getting like 800,000 views. Like Fox is like twice

31:36.000 --> 31:45.760
as many of them or three times as many of them, the top shows. So it's not like when they do lie,

31:45.760 --> 31:50.080
they're trying to convince people who don't believe them to believe something. They're just

31:50.080 --> 31:58.640
talking to their own audience. You know, there is still like, I would imagine 25 up to 30% of

31:58.640 --> 32:04.160
people who are totally on board with everything that is happening and everything that is happening

32:04.160 --> 32:08.080
with everything that is happening and everything that Democrats are doing, everything Biden is

32:08.080 --> 32:13.840
doing or like, yes, guns, there should not be guns in the hands of civilians. They just want

32:13.840 --> 32:20.640
a different kind of an America. They want like a European replicate, you know, European society

32:20.640 --> 32:29.920
being replicated within, you know, the boundaries of this country. So the question is, what is the

32:29.920 --> 32:38.240
solution moving forward with a system that is like, everybody's vote is basically equal. And if you

32:38.240 --> 32:42.960
vote that, yes, we're going to go towards the quote unquote, right direction and somebody else

32:42.960 --> 32:46.800
vote that no, we're going to go towards the wrong direction, then it just neutralized.

32:47.760 --> 32:52.800
And I don't think we can afford that anymore, considering how quickly technology is evolving.

32:52.800 --> 33:00.880
It doesn't neutralize as much as flip every election.

33:02.800 --> 33:04.160
Flip it to a different party.

33:06.720 --> 33:14.800
Yeah, that's what we've been seeing for recent history. The party power keeps getting voted out

33:14.800 --> 33:18.720
and replaced by the other party, which turns out to be no better. So they get voted out and

33:18.720 --> 33:25.200
replaced by the first party again. But the votes don't neutralize, but somebody wins.

33:25.200 --> 33:32.560
Isn't there a core problem? Having been entrenched in the bowels of the beast, the government,

33:34.400 --> 33:40.480
it almost doesn't matter anymore who's in charge, what party wins because of bureaucracy is driving

33:40.480 --> 33:46.560
the agenda. Right. It's never mattered. Like, both parties are pretty much on the same side of

33:46.560 --> 33:52.560
keeping in power. And if the bureaucracy wants to do something untoward, they hang it on whatever

33:52.560 --> 33:56.960
party's in power and they take the blame and the bureaucracy keeps steaming along doing whatever

33:56.960 --> 34:06.960
they want to do. And yeah, we almost, when you look at what Reagan did in the 80s, when he just said,

34:07.680 --> 34:13.200
all right, that's it, you're all fired. Unless we have someone with the stomach to do that,

34:13.200 --> 34:17.680
I don't know how to fix the bureaucracy. I mean, my buddies and I, who used to work there, we talk

34:17.680 --> 34:26.080
about this and we're absolutely dumbfounded on how this could be fixed now. Because they can take

34:26.080 --> 34:31.520
out any politician they want, as we've discovered, you know, with the Russia gate and anything else

34:31.520 --> 34:36.880
that went down there, the bureaucracy is quite capable of neutering any political change.

34:36.880 --> 34:44.400
Well, the solution is Bitcoin. It's very clear. Have a look at what Congress is doing now. They're

34:44.400 --> 34:49.040
talking about it, instituting a centralized... Yeah, but Ted Cruz at the same time is writing

34:49.040 --> 34:57.280
a bill that is going to undo the crypto part of that. Yeah, and by the... Even if they come up with

34:57.280 --> 35:05.200
a centralized digital currency, it's not going to be able to compete. Well, that's, I think I agree

35:05.200 --> 35:11.520
with you, David, absolutely. But that won't stop them. Well, they're free to go ahead. Exactly.

35:11.520 --> 35:18.320
And it's not going to be only the Fed. It's going to be Facebook, China has its own centralized

35:18.800 --> 35:26.800
currency, and all of the shitcoins, new shitcoins, basically, which would be CBDCs. They have to

35:26.800 --> 35:36.160
compete with Bitcoin, which is how many years? 11 years ahead of them. And, you know, does not

35:36.160 --> 35:40.880
have any requirement that they're having. And it's getting better every day. They're developers from

35:40.880 --> 35:47.200
all around the world. So what are they going to do about it? Miami just became the first city to

35:47.200 --> 35:57.360
give the residents of Miami Bitcoin dividend. That dude is like all in with Bitcoin. State of Wyoming,

35:57.360 --> 36:05.680
the Senator of Wyoming has laser eyes. She's like all in Bitcoin. So, you know, I think it's way too

36:05.680 --> 36:11.840
far gone for anybody to be able to do anything. But obviously, they're not just going to let it go.

36:11.840 --> 36:16.800
They're not just going to let it go. Because all of this crap that they're coming up with that, oh,

36:16.800 --> 36:23.360
it's user environment is getting warmer because of Bitcoin. I was just going to say that the climate

36:23.360 --> 36:27.840
kids are now on board with Bitcoin. Let them be. Let them be on board, you know, because

36:30.000 --> 36:38.400
El Salvador, they're mining Bitcoin with the volcano. So, you know, this is a different kind

36:38.400 --> 36:45.120
of a game and bureaucracy cannot catch up with this game. Because this game is agile, open source,

36:45.120 --> 36:51.040
and truly decentralized. You know, people are from all around the world who have a stake in it. But

36:51.040 --> 36:57.280
at the same time, it's not like they're just going to let it go. You know, so I think the solution

36:57.280 --> 37:05.040
is to accept that bureaucracy has won already. The establishment has won. And this goes beyond

37:05.040 --> 37:11.120
bipartisan kind of a deal. It has nothing to do with Democrat and Republican. It's the literal

37:11.120 --> 37:18.800
deep state. It has won. Agreed. And so all we have to do is just throw sand in its engine until it

37:18.800 --> 37:25.600
just collapse under the weight of its own bureaucracy. Well, a bunch of us talked about,

37:25.600 --> 37:33.120
you know, if all of us just went back to cash in the short term, we just stop using our credit

37:33.120 --> 37:40.640
cards. I don't have a credit card everywhere out on the street. My credit score is stellar.

37:44.720 --> 37:49.600
I want to hear. If you don't have a credit card, the bureaucracy is going to be looking at why,

37:49.600 --> 37:53.520
what are you doing? Because you're obviously you're doing something untoward, right?

37:54.960 --> 38:01.280
So back to cash, how's that going to help? It would just because the whole system now is

38:01.280 --> 38:09.200
snowballing into using digital, their digital equivalent, centralized digital. And the whole

38:09.200 --> 38:13.680
data model of selling the data of what's being sold and who's buying it and that. I mean,

38:13.680 --> 38:17.840
they're making a lot of money off that. So if everyone they're buying with cash,

38:18.400 --> 38:23.120
first of all, there's not enough cash to go around. That could be an initial problem. But

38:23.120 --> 38:30.080
it would just it would just break what they're trying to do. They it would break what the

38:30.080 --> 38:34.320
financial institutions are trying to do. But financial institutions are the place that cash

38:34.320 --> 38:41.520
is coming from. So they can't dump like what they're doing. Like, I think like 35% of the

38:41.520 --> 38:48.320
entirety of US dollar has been printed in the past year. 35% of all of it. They just dumped

38:48.320 --> 38:57.600
they dropped it on the world. Like, there you go. So if the US isn't isn't Canada, I mean,

38:57.600 --> 39:01.520
no one buys anything in the store. You never see cash being used anymore.

39:02.720 --> 39:11.840
That seldom. So that would really upset the apple cart and maybe open the door for Bitcoin and

39:11.840 --> 39:18.320
those things then to step in. But as long as we're using the existing digital way of buying things,

39:19.600 --> 39:26.160
why bother with Bitcoin? That's the feedback I'm getting from people. Well, because Bitcoin is

39:26.160 --> 39:34.240
like you have gold in your phone, that you can use it to pay for different kinds of stuff. And the

39:34.240 --> 39:41.920
value of it is not collapsing like dollar. People will be forced, I'm afraid. They're going to be

39:41.920 --> 39:51.360
forced to learn how to work with Bitcoin when the value of dollar, for example, has dropped so badly

39:51.360 --> 39:56.720
that it's just unrecognizable, you know, already gasses up like 50%.

39:59.440 --> 40:02.640
Oh, it's unbelievable. I mean, we're at we're at a buck 50 a liter.

40:02.640 --> 40:08.400
Right. So those cash or times four times foreign cash that people could be dealing with,

40:08.960 --> 40:15.280
the value of them is being determined by this entire system. So you can use cash,

40:15.280 --> 40:19.600
but the value of your $10 today is not going to be same tomorrow, it's going to be lower.

40:19.600 --> 40:23.120
And the day after that is going to be lower, then it's going to get lower, then it's going to get

40:23.120 --> 40:28.080
lower. So what's the point of that? That's why like houses are so expensive right now.

40:29.040 --> 40:34.800
If you have a property and want to sell it, you can sell it like twice the price,

40:35.360 --> 40:38.480
because of inflation, all the prices are like so high.

40:38.480 --> 40:49.920
Right. No, I'm not saying using cash is a solution of any kind, I see it more of a disruptor to what

40:49.920 --> 40:56.800
the institutions are trying to do right now. They're trying to come up with their option to

40:56.800 --> 41:05.920
cryptocurrency in their own way. And I just had a friend who's retired, used to be insurance

41:05.920 --> 41:12.960
business, send me an email saying, Wally, better make sure you update your will to include your

41:12.960 --> 41:21.760
cryptocurrency. And I thought, well, isn't that an insightful into people don't understand what

41:21.760 --> 41:27.200
cryptocurrency is? I just sent him a note back saying anyone that has my private key owns the

41:27.200 --> 41:33.680
cryptocurrency. So why would I want to share that with the government for death tax and all that

41:33.680 --> 41:44.560
stuff? But again, it's how do you break that perception of what it is? I don't think people

41:44.560 --> 41:49.200
get it yet, because we're so that's why I'm saying we're so ensconced in the whole digital

41:49.200 --> 41:56.000
world of our current banking system, and how that exists and works, which is environmentally

41:56.000 --> 42:06.000
neutral, clearly, because their computers run on sunshine and rainbows. But yeah, I'm just thinking

42:06.000 --> 42:13.120
out loud, I don't have an answer is just and maybe next the spring coming up when the housing

42:13.120 --> 42:18.720
market and everything goes belly up. And another as we have another big downturn in the economy.

42:20.880 --> 42:24.480
If you look at what's happening in China right now, I mean, that's all going pear shaped.

42:24.480 --> 42:31.120
If you can believe what you know, I tend to go to the South Asia news. I know they have a dislike

42:31.120 --> 42:36.160
for China. So I take what they say with a grain of salt, but the footage of the riots that are

42:36.160 --> 42:41.360
going on in the smaller towns and stuff that people protesting throughout China, the shortages,

42:42.240 --> 42:45.520
they don't have fuel, they don't have heat, they don't have electricity.

42:46.800 --> 42:54.080
And then the corruption in the the, the real estate markets there. That's all coming home

42:54.080 --> 43:01.040
to me. So that will make what happened with, you know, beer Stearns and in 2008, look like

43:01.040 --> 43:07.040
a church picnic, one might expect, I don't know, not being an expert in any of that, but it looks

43:07.040 --> 43:15.440
pretty ominous. So if that happens, I think that would be a huge opener for a Bitcoin and looking

43:15.440 --> 43:20.000
to, as you say, to place your money and your investment somewhere that won't depreciate.

43:20.000 --> 43:23.920
Yeah, that's why I celebrate the inflation.

43:25.520 --> 43:29.040
So just drive more people to Bitcoin, which will raise the price.

43:29.920 --> 43:37.120
You see, this is the thing about truth with capital T, because if you expand the context

43:37.120 --> 43:41.680
within which we're talking about all these things, then good and bad become meaningless,

43:41.680 --> 43:45.440
because you can say, well, inflation is terrible on its own. But if it's leading to

43:45.440 --> 43:53.360
revolution, revolutionizing the finance world, and therefore the rest of life with Bitcoin,

43:53.360 --> 44:00.320
then inflation was not necessarily a bad thing. You know, and it's endless, this stream is endless.

44:01.440 --> 44:07.440
So just take a frame of it and make a decision. And you know, it's this certainty,

44:07.440 --> 44:12.000
I tweeted something a couple days ago, that fundamentalist religions are going to make a

44:12.000 --> 44:18.160
comeback because people need a degree of certainty. Michael Flynn was saying that if you have one

44:18.160 --> 44:24.800
country under God, we need to have one religion under God. And it's like it's, you know, it's,

44:25.360 --> 44:31.200
we kind of called it on this podcast, religions are going to make a comeback.

44:33.440 --> 44:40.240
Yep. Well, I think just watching the career and what the years of, you know, Jordan Peterson,

44:40.240 --> 44:46.080
what he's been through and why people are listening to him. And it's because

44:49.920 --> 44:54.320
this meeting has been upgraded by the host and now includes unlimited. Right. Okay.

44:54.320 --> 44:55.840
I didn't do anything, but thank you.

44:59.840 --> 45:03.840
Yes. Wait a minute.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.880
Did you see the latest Jordan Peterson podcast?

45:08.880 --> 45:11.440
The warning. I didn't see that.

45:12.240 --> 45:17.440
The one where you have the safety of the author of the Bitcoin standard.

45:17.440 --> 45:20.640
I haven't said it's on my queue to watch. I haven't watched it. It is good.

45:20.640 --> 45:24.240
It is wonderful watching Peterson get orange pill.

45:25.360 --> 45:26.000
Well, nice.

45:27.680 --> 45:31.200
You can watch his mind be blown. He's it's great.

45:31.200 --> 45:44.000
He can't believe how radical it is to separate money from state. He can't believe how Bitcoin

45:44.000 --> 45:51.280
mining is actually good for the environment and frees up isolated resources and allows you to

45:51.280 --> 46:01.680
monetize sources of electricity that are off the grid. Like he kind of bought into the fear

46:01.680 --> 46:09.040
uncertainty and doubt around the environmentalists. And then he sees now that it's the truth is the

46:09.040 --> 46:13.280
opposite. Oh, I have to watch that. That'll be.

46:13.280 --> 46:19.120
Yeah. It's very fun to watch. Highly recommended.

46:19.120 --> 46:24.000
Yeah. Environmentalists. Most of them, I would argue, they don't know what the hell they're

46:24.000 --> 46:28.960
talking about. They just. Well, there's the last that the two syllable

46:28.960 --> 46:32.800
word and the last syllable, I think, is the most most applicable part of that.

46:35.120 --> 46:38.080
Not environmentalists. Yes, they are.

46:38.080 --> 46:48.320
Well, you look at what Scotland and the Edinburgh that last summit and the wheels are falling off.

46:49.600 --> 46:54.640
And I took the time and I went to the UN and read what the UN Charter says.

46:57.120 --> 47:01.360
And it ain't anything that the media is talking about. I mean, they essentially say we have a

47:01.360 --> 47:06.400
long term rise in temperature. Well, we all know that. I mean, we're still coming out of a glacial

47:06.400 --> 47:12.720
age, but that the imminent destruction of mankind is certainly not on the table.

47:13.440 --> 47:18.640
And that's what it's it's amazing to watch everyone buy into that.

47:18.640 --> 47:26.320
No, it's just we are being held back by a small group of people who are probably among the most

47:26.320 --> 47:34.320
incompetent people on this planet and their leeches. They don't produce anything.

47:34.320 --> 47:42.640
They they just, you know, monopolize in the political power and yes, they've been boiling

47:42.640 --> 47:49.840
the frog for a long time, but then Brexit and Trump happen and the freak them out and they

47:49.840 --> 47:55.920
realize that they don't have much time. And, you know, Internet, they couldn't do much about it

47:55.920 --> 48:04.880
to shut it down. They tried. They're still trying. And, you know, that's why they're getting more

48:04.880 --> 48:14.240
coercive. They're getting more violent. Well, the new the new laws in Canada are are really bizarre.

48:15.680 --> 48:24.720
That you can now be you can be charged for something you say on the Internet. That's a

48:24.720 --> 48:35.120
that's against the policy of the government. It's beyond that. It's the new legislation that

48:35.120 --> 48:42.320
they've just passed now, the new bills, they can walk into your emails and anything and hold you

48:42.320 --> 48:47.520
accountable. I mean, it's an effect in the UK. I mean, the police have come to arrested people

48:47.520 --> 48:54.960
for Australia's contents of emails. Yeah. So I mean, you really are living in the land of the

48:54.960 --> 49:00.880
free. Yes, down there. There's been no cases in Canada has not yet. But

49:02.960 --> 49:09.440
most of the computer is on board. I know my friend is stepping down now because he can't

49:09.440 --> 49:16.000
tolerate what's going on. I mean, it is crazy, especially when it's being pushed by government

49:16.000 --> 49:25.600
that got what 31% of votes even in that rigged system. Oh, 33% I apologize.

49:30.480 --> 49:34.880
Yeah, it is a bizarre system of government in that regard. It just yeah, you know,

49:34.880 --> 49:39.760
the only thing that has kept America so far is because there are like 400 million guns

49:39.760 --> 49:46.640
in this country. So they really want to take the guns away because state monopoly and violence

49:46.640 --> 49:53.360
is even better than state monopoly on finance. You can force people to do whatever you want them

49:53.360 --> 50:00.400
to do. Well, our government has doubled down on that again, and wanted to, you know, want to

50:00.400 --> 50:04.240
get rid of it. But and they keep talking about the horrible crimes and all this going on. And

50:04.240 --> 50:09.040
two things I found interesting is when you go on to the federal government websites and the RCMP

50:09.040 --> 50:17.840
websites, there's no data since 2016. Which I find interesting. Why is that? But anyways,

50:17.840 --> 50:27.360
if you look at the 2016 data, 600 people died at the hands of firearms in Canada. 250 of those

50:27.360 --> 50:34.880
were gang members shooting each other. 140 of those were in native reserves, people shooting each other.

50:36.880 --> 50:47.680
And the rest are crimes and a handful of domestics, but I mean, 638 million people is not a big number

50:48.480 --> 50:53.760
at all. That would warrant, you know, taking everyone's rights away. It's quite bizarre.

50:53.760 --> 50:57.200
But again, you don't ever see those numbers on the media are talked about.

50:58.720 --> 51:05.440
And the general perception is guns are bad. Right. I mean, it would be interesting to see

51:06.640 --> 51:17.280
how the dynamic will be changed when not when as 3D printing and 3D printable weapons become more

51:17.280 --> 51:26.640
more mainstream. And it seems like this adoption of technology is far faster in countries that are

51:26.640 --> 51:36.240
technologically behind. Like look at even Iran or Azerbaijan, Armenia, Yemen, they're using

51:36.240 --> 51:46.960
kamikaze UAVs to and they change the entire dynamic of power in that region because you make like a

51:46.960 --> 51:56.320
$500 drone and you, you know, weaponize it, you put a bomb on it. And the only way that, for example,

51:56.320 --> 52:01.840
Saudi Arabia can shoot one of them down is with a rocket that can shoot one of them down.

52:01.840 --> 52:06.880
For example, Saudi Arabia can shoot one of them down is with a rocket that costs like half a

52:06.880 --> 52:16.160
million. How can you, you know, how can you maintain the expense? So like Israel is coming

52:16.160 --> 52:21.360
with new technology. This is what I'm saying. What I'm saying there is a plan, maybe. I'm not

52:21.360 --> 52:25.920
necessarily talking about the planetary plan. I'm talking about some kind of a plan that we

52:25.920 --> 52:31.680
might not even know. Like what Einstein said that all the forces we experience in this universe is

52:31.680 --> 52:37.360
like the tail of a lion, the body of a lion is somewhere else, right? That's a different kind

52:37.360 --> 52:42.480
of a revolution that could happen and fundamentally change everything that, hey, who sets the narrative

52:42.480 --> 52:48.560
for what can be researched scientifically? Because there are people who have, you know,

52:48.560 --> 52:55.600
interest in certain kind of topics, certain kind of field to get the grant money. But now that we

52:55.600 --> 53:02.560
can crowdsource that kind of a process, what is the point of having conventional universities?

53:02.560 --> 53:07.440
You know, I remember Jordan Peterson's budget got cut down by the government in Canada and

53:07.440 --> 53:12.560
they crowdsourced it and he raised like six times the amount, seven times the amount, something like

53:12.560 --> 53:19.040
that. And then people are engaged, right? Because it's voluntary participation rather than, oh,

53:19.040 --> 53:26.800
you're forced to participate because, you know, we have to be a society somehow. Well, I mean,

53:26.800 --> 53:32.400
Peter Thiel, I haven't heard much from him lately, but he spoke out very vehemently that don't send

53:32.400 --> 53:39.040
your kid to university. There are much better options to be educated. Peter Thiel recently said

53:39.040 --> 53:49.520
that AGI isn't happening. That's the last that I heard of him. AGI. Artificial General Intelligence.

53:49.520 --> 53:54.320
Ah, well, we don't even have that in the population. How can we expect that from machines?

53:56.800 --> 54:06.000
Did I say that out loud? Yeah. Well, there's that new university being opened in Austin.

54:06.000 --> 54:12.880
It'll be interesting to see if that can make a goal of it. Of AGI? The reaction to that's been

54:12.880 --> 54:21.360
pretty funny. Yeah, exactly. The vestiges of the IDW got together and decided to create a new

54:21.360 --> 54:30.560
university, but they're not going to be accredited for some time. So first few cohorts of classes

54:30.560 --> 54:37.600
were just going to pay for the knowledge, not the credits. But actually, the Pearson and Amuse had

54:37.600 --> 54:41.760
a really interesting discussion about universities and credentials at the end of the podcast.

54:41.760 --> 54:48.880
I learned that Pearson has resigned his position at U of T. He just can't see the benefit of

54:48.880 --> 54:56.480
teaching dozens of students when he could go online and teach millions for free. And, you know,

54:56.480 --> 55:01.600
barely teaching at, you know, conventional university because at least like third of

55:01.600 --> 55:06.960
your time is being wasted talking to people who are protesting something. Somebody is offended by

55:06.960 --> 55:15.280
someone. Well, Pearson said that the great time waster in an academic job is applying for grants.

55:16.800 --> 55:22.960
That a Canadian professor will spend like 40% of their time on grant proposals.

55:22.960 --> 55:28.560
Not research, not teaching grant proposals. It's just bureaucracy.

55:30.080 --> 55:35.840
U of T just torpedoed some proposal in Toronto, didn't they? Because they didn't do it according

55:35.840 --> 55:42.400
to the criteria that they wanted. There was some controversy I just caught in the news.

55:42.400 --> 55:53.360
Sorry. You know, Orson Welles, the famed director and writer and all that. His last interview,

55:53.360 --> 55:59.440
I think it was like two weeks before he died, he also said that the biggest time waster for

55:59.440 --> 56:08.640
him was looking to raise money. And, you know, I think it's happening cross-border for

56:08.640 --> 56:16.320
entrepreneurs. This also has been the case before crypto. And crypto is kind of solving that as

56:16.320 --> 56:22.400
well, that you don't have to go and, you know, get on your knees in front of very few, like VCs and

56:22.400 --> 56:27.600
they're like, just please give me money. And I give you like 50% of my company or whatever.

56:28.960 --> 56:33.600
You know, you just launch an ICO or NFD or whatever. Yeah.

56:33.600 --> 56:38.880
I just joined a DAO yesterday, the Constitution DAO, if you know this one.

56:40.880 --> 56:49.840
So they, in something like 48 hours, raised $20 million to bid on the original copy of the

56:49.840 --> 56:55.920
US Constitution at the South Beach auction. And it's happening tonight. I don't know how it turned

56:55.920 --> 57:00.720
out. It's pretty amazing. It's a very interesting thing.

57:00.720 --> 57:06.720
Oh, hell yeah. It's pretty amazing. Yeah. Well, anything can be tokenized.

57:06.720 --> 57:14.960
Anything can be NFT. So, you know, that's another thing that it might take people a little bit to

57:15.600 --> 57:21.760
get the impact of it and significant of it. But once they get it, I think it's going to

57:21.760 --> 57:32.240
explode even further. It's already exploded. An acquaintance who's a musician in Ottawa,

57:32.240 --> 57:38.800
and she's done the whole Nashville and songwriting in LA. And she just crowdsources

57:38.800 --> 57:43.840
her albums. So two years ahead, she starts and she gets all the money. She has a target

57:43.840 --> 57:49.920
and she gets the money she needs to get to $30,000 together. And she'll put an album together.

57:49.920 --> 57:57.600
It's perfect. A really good idea. And the studios must just hate that.

57:58.640 --> 58:04.800
Well, all gatekeepers, you know, all the middlemen, all the third parties are

58:04.800 --> 58:09.600
eventually going to be affected. Because this is disruption of trust.

58:10.320 --> 58:13.840
That hey, I don't need to listen to you or go through you to do what I want to do. I

58:13.840 --> 58:20.960
can do it myself directly with my audience. And you know, you don't really need to have

58:20.960 --> 58:26.720
millions of people, you can have like 2000 people who are very committed to what you're doing and

58:27.360 --> 58:31.200
totally make a living out of it. Right? Yeah.

58:33.040 --> 58:39.840
The problem is the third parties and gatekeepers and all those people because they don't want to

58:39.840 --> 58:44.240
give up their power. I don't think they have any other choice, but they're going to fight

58:44.240 --> 58:59.040
all the way. You know, it's all about power. David, what do you think about Peter Thiel

58:59.040 --> 59:06.880
saying AGI is probably not going to happen? I'd like more details.

59:06.880 --> 59:12.640
He's a smart guy. He probably is thinking it won't happen in a certain time frame. I don't

59:12.640 --> 59:17.920
know if he offered the timeframe. I'd be surprised if he said it will never happen or it's impossible.

59:18.640 --> 59:25.360
Yeah, he was saying that. But he might be saying it's not going to happen in our lifetime, like in

59:25.360 --> 59:33.040
the next 50 or 80 years or something like that. I think he's wrong. Right? If that's what he said.

59:33.040 --> 59:41.920
I mean, another question is, how can we rely completely on our definition of AGI? Like we

59:41.920 --> 59:49.600
expect certain kind of what we consider to be intelligence to emerge as a result of a process

59:50.320 --> 59:55.280
that become AGI, but it could happen in a completely different way that we can't even comprehend.

59:55.280 --> 01:00:06.880
Possibly, but it could happen in a way that's pretty clear. That's smart. Like if it starts

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:14.720
running its own DAO on Web 3 and making a lot of money and hiring people to do its bidding,

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:20.640
that's a pretty good clue. Yeah, if we know it's AGI,

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:29.040
because it could be like an avatar influencer, because we're headed towards a place that you

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:38.000
can't really tell the difference. Right now, you can't have virtual avatar as your presentation,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:44.960
as an influencer. So like news people are going to little by little, they become virtual,

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:52.160
again, more predictable kind of positions. And then at some point, they will be driven by like

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:58.080
AIs that they just give you weather, but they're so realistic that you can't really tell whether

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:06.160
or not they're humans or AI. It could easily communicate with humans only through text,

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:12.560
like email or Discord or some other textual interface. It would be impossible to tell it from

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:19.920
a super intelligent human. You don't need to depict that really. Not in a video sense. You

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:26.000
don't have to show a face or anything. It could just be a very smart agent on the other end of

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:36.400
a textual interface. If you got a job offer through email for a million dollars a year,

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:43.360
would you take it? It just says, keep doing what you're doing, but wants to support you and

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:47.280
maybe give you some editorial direction here and there.

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.400
Sort of like the CPP.

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:54.880
Yeah, or CIA or AGI.

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:55.840
Or that, yes.

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:57.040
AGI is a new agency.

01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:06.960
Yep. Well done. Yes.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:10.560
Or if it's just writing software, it doesn't need to show a face.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:21.040
No. This anonymous economy, the Balaji actually talks about that a lot. I mean, it really is

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:25.280
awesome. It's like totally spot on every single time.

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:26.960
Wonderful. Absolutely wonderful.

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:37.760
So yeah, what is even the point of revealing your identity? If you want to get a coding job,

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:42.640
you just share your GitHub. That's it. You're hired or you're not hired.

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:44.160
What difference does it make who you are?

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:49.440
Yeah. Doesn't matter if you're one person or a team of people.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:56.880
So the solution to cancel culture is not to ban politics, is to ban office work and work

01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:07.600
at home without revealing your true identity. Deliver the work, and there is a smart contract

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:11.600
that is going to release whatever you're supposed to be getting once your work was delivered.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:15.920
Except managers in an auto offer, the government's heads are exploding because they can't walk by

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:17.120
someone's desk and poke out.

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:25.040
They can get an acoustic guitar and a bowl and start practicing how they can make money on the

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:36.080
streets. They have tough competition ahead of them. Those are really the worst people that our society

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:48.000
and this Western civilization has produced. Managerial physician, like, dude, go fuck yourself.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Who the fuck do you think you are telling me what to do? Like you're fatter than I am.

01:03:54.800 --> 01:04:00.560
You're uglier than I am, and you're definitely not as smart as I am. You're just a fatter than

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:06.480
I am. You're uglier than I am, and you're definitely not as smart as I am. You're just a fucking

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:12.000
asshole with a badge that says manager. Your parents must be proud, but I can't care less.

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:21.680
We tried to offer up our little bunch of tech guys, our little contribution to International

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:28.240
Women's Day, and that is we coined the term self-lubricating uncaring tyrants to describe

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:29.200
our management.

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:35.040
Yeah, very, yes, that's exactly what they are. That deserves to be on a t-shirt and given to

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:45.040
those people. So yeah, we're getting rid of them, and the biggest manager of it all is the government.

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:56.000
How do you unpack the FBI and CIA? You know there's lots of good competent people in the rank and

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:07.360
file. Leadership, it's the top leadership. It's one percent of the people that are in the bureaucracy

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:12.560
and in the cult, and then there's one percent of that one percent who are running the narrative

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:23.040
basically. They went out of control. What they did with Project Veritas, just raiding their homes

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:31.040
and getting into their phones, leaking information to New York Times, and as David says, a lot of

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:38.080
leftists, they're even like, what's going on? We've gone maybe a little too far here. ACLU I think

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:44.560
came out in defense of Project Veritas, but I think it's crystal clear for people on the right,

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:52.560
actual right, not corporate right, establishment right, that the system is just flawed against

01:05:52.560 --> 01:06:01.280
them and it's rigged against them culturally and politically and economically. Look, Michael Flynn

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:08.480
again, I think Bank of America, he was Bank of America. They shut down their credit cards on

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:15.360
a bunch of his accounts because they didn't want to associate themselves with him. They say it's bad

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:23.760
for the brand of Bank of America. Well, just screw this system. You create an alternative with your

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:34.320
crypto and with Bitcoin and just live as if you don't depend on these people. That's why a lot of

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:42.000
states are doubling down on state coming before the federal government, because the power of

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.920
federal government comes from the state. You don't have a mandate without having the states.

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:54.000
Yeah, and the federal government is trying to upend that big time, it seems to me.

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:59.280
They want to exert power. The same people who want to do it during the Civil War.

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:04.800
You know, Lincoln was a Republican. Now, some people can say that, well, the war was illegal.

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:13.680
The war was illegal, but that's a bigger argument that laws are laws coming prior to ethics and

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:19.280
morality or ethics and morality are coming prior to laws and who is there to define either of those

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:29.840
things. So what was the story with there were people being shipped to Florida? They're being

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:37.360
shipped all over the place. The governor here is like, we're going to send them back. We're not

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:45.040
going to accept them. Yeah, man, they're pushing people way too far and they're pushing people

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:53.440
way too far. And if things explode, it's going to explode really badly. So I don't know what's

01:07:53.440 --> 01:08:03.520
going to happen, but their approval ratings is down to like high 20s. Congress's approval rating

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:11.840
is like low 20s consistently. And at the same time, they're trying to pass this massive bill

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:17.840
that they have, build back better, but it's just a joke. If they do that, it's a very different

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:25.600
kind of a game because it's almost impossible to undo any of those entitlement programs and all

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:33.200
that that they're putting basically. Didn't they pass that one? Who was that photo of the boat

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:38.080
where they were saying get it done and Biden was signing something? Well, it was an infrastructure

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:49.200
bill. Biden signed, but this is build back better, that this is basically a Green New Deal on steroids.

01:08:51.200 --> 01:09:01.520
It expands on government programs. It will raise dumber kids and more dependent adults to the

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:11.840
government. And it's cradle to grave. It's totally socialization of America. So that actually

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:17.840
supposed to happen or not happen tonight. So people on the right, this is what I'm saying,

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:28.800
that they're making alliances around this ethos of Judeo-Christian West. And I guess we'll see.

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:34.400
Did any of you guys listen to my episode with Jason Giorgiani because he has some interesting ideas?

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:45.680
I haven't heard. No. I hope you tell. Oh, Jason Giorgiani is a, he was a co-founder of

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:53.760
Alt-right Corporation, came out, wrote a bunch of books, including Prometheism. And he had another

01:09:53.760 --> 01:10:02.000
one, Closer Encounters, said by UFOs and aliens and all that. But his thought basically is that

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:11.760
certain people have made a choice to break the, to break United States basically. So you don't

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:18.560
have any national identity, which is exactly what's been happening in Canada. And the dude said it

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:27.600
himself. It's like a globalist plan. America is the last barrier. So if that would be successful,

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:33.280
then you got to wonder what's going to happen because dollar is going to crash.

01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:37.200
A lot of people are saying the dollar is going to crash anyways. It's not going to be a reserve

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:47.120
currency of the world anymore. So we're in the crisis. So we're in the crisis. So we're in the

01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:54.960
crisis in that, the fourth turning, the fourth turning thesis in the crisis phase of it. And,

01:10:54.960 --> 01:11:00.720
you know, on the other side of this abyss could be golden days or it could be total hell. Who knows?

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:02.240
Right?

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:17.920
Right. Yeah, I have a lot of those concerns and I look at Europe and if I were in the UK,

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:23.840
I would count my blessings that I got the heck out of the EU. Because that's government on

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:30.400
steroids over the EU now. The whole cohort in Brussels that are even elected that are

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:39.920
running the show. And it sure feels like, but who would be the actors that would like to break

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:50.640
America? I read that study from MIT that was done in 2017. And they documented over two and a half

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:58.800
million people working for the CCP in China. And their job is to get on all the social media and

01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:06.320
all the email groups and everywhere and push an agenda around the world and heavily push the

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:12.720
agenda in the US. And you guys were talking about AGI. Well, a lot of that, you know,

01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:19.360
you could, they're probably working on trying to weaponize that. So you would think that

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:27.680
in the old days, it was the KGB. But I think that it would really be to the advantage of the CCP.

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:37.280
If the US did come apart. So I could see a real strong influence there, driving that.

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:45.200
And then you have all the financial institutions that have bet the farm on China. The Europe is

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:49.440
just in over their head. I mean, from Italian governments who have gotten into bed with them

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:55.680
on the Belt and Road to pay out their debts to Germany that has every industrial giant in Germany

01:12:55.680 --> 01:13:03.440
has bet the farm on setting up business in China. As the Japanese are now pulling out,

01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:08.240
you know, out of China in a big way, most of the picture, the Chinese government, the Japanese

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:14.560
government has said, given incentives to corporations to pull out of China. So they see the writing on

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:21.440
the wall. But I think the the big conglomerates out of Europe, and, you know, the Googles and the

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:26.720
the Amazons and everyone they they're left holding the bag now because I don't think they had a

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:33.600
contingency plan when the whole China thing didn't go the way they expected. When the government

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:39.360
walks into all the companies in China and says, No, we now own 51% of everything. We don't care

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:45.840
where the company's origin is. Well, that's a huge game changer. And that's pretty disruptive. So

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:51.120
yeah, there's I see a whole bunch of different forces, I should point out that are that wanted

01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:58.320
dismantle and fragment the West and they're succeeding, it seemed to me. Yeah, I mean,

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:05.680
it's far more the fault of the West than it's, you know, it's the fault of the CCP. Like why

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:12.400
wouldn't have why wouldn't they have agents trying to spread propaganda in the West? Like of course

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:18.640
they do. And the problem is that people who are supposed to be leaders of the West, they're

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:27.120
already in bed with China. They already have investments. And you know, all their interest is

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:34.160
for China to do good. There's a congresswoman from Virginia that she has, I think like a million

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:43.520
like a million dollars invested in Alibaba. Yep. So it's very corrupt. And the corruption has came

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:49.520
to the surface. You know, I keep saying, man, Trump was a psychedelic. Trump was a psychedelic,

01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:56.400
everybody really, really hard on him. Everybody, you know, now are facing their demons. And demons

01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:01.920
are all unmasked. And it's just a matter of what are you going to do with it? You know, is this is

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:09.600
this how you want to live your life that you will be given a app on your phone, which is basically

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:17.040
your new operating system, and everything else will run on that basis. And this operating system

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:22.640
will work for as long as government confirmed that you've received all the latest requirements,

01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:30.000
including vaccines and, you know, and then they give you, you know, rewards as central bank digital

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:36.240
currency, they give you a little bit of money here and there, which has an expiration date.

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:43.280
So you can't like do anything else with it, you can't really keep it, you have to spend it by

01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:50.080
certain amount of time. Otherwise, it will be expired. So this modern modern monetary

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:57.840
theory would have worked great if there was the absence of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency,

01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:04.400
because they would have monopoly on, you know, on the currency. And then they would just print

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:10.480
indefinitely. That's the idea that they have. And I think a lot of them who's still pushing this idea,

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:15.760
they just don't understand Bitcoin, or they think that they can't control Bitcoin. But maybe,

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:22.480
you know, quantum computing comes in, like some people are saying, completely change the game

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:28.400
against Bitcoin. I don't think like, with a technology that will be disruptive, a solution

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:35.760
wouldn't be developed in its counter. But that's one of the arguments that is being made that our

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:39.280
quantum computer is going to make it obsolete. I don't think that's the case.

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:45.920
I think quantum computers are hyped a bit. David would know more, I think.

01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:51.280
Yeah, like even if somebody invented a quantum computer tomorrow, they could

01:16:51.280 --> 01:17:02.560
they could break the encryption in short order. Bitcoin would just release a fork that used

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:09.200
another encryption algorithm that was quantum computer resistant and may go on. Yeah, so it

01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:17.360
might be down for a day or two as they put in the new encryption algorithm, but it's not going to

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:25.520
destroy Bitcoin. Bitcoin cannot be destroyed. Yeah, also the argument of EMP, electromagnetic

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:33.200
pulse, if they like explode something above the atmosphere. Is it above the atmosphere?

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:39.280
Yes, above the atmosphere to affect the grid, electricity grid. The moment that grid comes back

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:49.760
up, Bitcoin network is back online. Yeah, so the argument is whether or not an entity

01:17:50.880 --> 01:18:01.840
can shut down electricity and maintain that dark mode of no electricity for a long amount of time.

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:05.360
I don't think that would be the case. Even though some people again make the argument

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:11.840
that there are interests who want to basically monopolize in this singularity level technology

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:18.800
while keeping the rest of people in this very deindustrialized kind of a state that people have

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:28.400
farms and people just pray and go to church and all that. And those people, even though they don't

01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:36.720
believe, for example, in people like Jordan Peterson or Alexander Dugan, they are promoting

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:42.480
their work because it helps the society to move towards that direction away from technological

01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:53.520
adoption and this ascendance towards a more simple life of farming and community and family

01:18:53.520 --> 01:19:00.560
and religion and those kind of things. Interesting game is going on.

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:11.280
Well, again, it is stopping people from moving to farms or small villages and opting out of

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:17.840
modern society. But when they do that, they also opt out of the modern market and

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:22.960
they will encounter poverty like we had a couple hundred years ago, but that might be okay for them.

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:25.760
It's not going to affect the rest of us.

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:35.760
Yeah, they don't see it that way. They see it that the market should accept them as they are.

01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:44.080
But my argument is, even if you look at Amish, the Amish people who are being pointed out as

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:50.240
some kind of an example of look how simple life can be and how peaceful without the use

01:19:50.240 --> 01:20:00.080
of modern technology. But where are they living? Amish live in United States. They are protected

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:07.440
by layers after layers of people who are using the highest level of modern technology to protect

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:12.960
that county, to protect that state, to protect the borders of United States and US military

01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:20.320
is protecting this land and the integrity of this territory. It is only because of that that you're

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:27.680
able to live life without the use of modern technology. Otherwise, move some Amish to

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:35.280
northern Pakistan and put them in some tribal land. Just see how long you can live a happy,

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:40.240
peaceful life without the modern technology. Not that long, dude. Maybe about a week.

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:50.960
So isn't this more about decentralizing though? Our population has gone up at least 25, 30%

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:57.920
because of COVID up here, north of Toronto now, four hours north of Toronto, because people have

01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:05.200
moved up here. They bugged out of Toronto. A lot of people are, we've got fiber up here and decent

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:10.960
internet. So they're working from here. So a lot of people are remote. I know a couple of people

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:15.920
have moved up to Elliott Lake and they're working remotely. Their jobs in Toronto. They're in the

01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:23.120
insurance business and a lot of companies are supporting that because it means they can drop

01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:30.000
the huge cost of their real estate of providing desks and work areas in a building. So that's

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:38.560
happening, but that's in concert with the technology. Yeah, it's adoption, but it also leaves

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:46.480
certain people behind. For example, the person who clean or people who are in charge of cleaning

01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:53.040
up those massive corporate buildings in downtown Toronto. If work is going to be mobile, what's

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:56.480
going to happen to those buildings? What's going to happen to those buildings? What's going to

01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:00.800
be mobile? What's going to happen to those buildings? What's going to happen to concept of

01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:09.760
cities and how much investment has been made both psychologically and financially by the system

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:17.360
in order to concentrate people in the smaller places that depends on their services more and

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:24.000
more. So they can be surveilled. So they can be dependent on using, as you said, credit cards,

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:32.560
or they'll be forced to get loans and mortgages. Most people are already living on this social

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:38.720
credit system. It's just that it hasn't been expanded to the level that they want to expand

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:45.680
it to, which is basically every aspect of your life. So yeah, decentralization is absolutely

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:52.160
the key. It's just a matter of adoption of it and infrastructure of it.

01:22:52.160 --> 01:23:02.000
I mean, if people leave the city, then people that could not previously afford to move to the city

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
will be able to move to the city.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:15.680
Yeah, bang on, David, bang on. Toronto is gotten ahead of itself in terms of what it can do and

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:23.600
what it can deliver, I think, to the citizens that are there now. And a lot of it, I'm guessing,

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:28.320
is a lot of foreign money came into buying property and driving the prices up. I don't know if

01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:34.320
that's true or not, but that was my perception. So this would equalize some of that now if people

01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:41.200
are decentralizing and moving away. So I see that as a good thing. I don't.

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:46.160
I'm not all that pleased that all these people have arrived on my doorstep here because I was

01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:52.640
kind of liking the isolation. But on the other hand, it means it means work, it means more

01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:57.120
prosperity for the people that are here. And it has in the past been one of the poorest

01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:05.040
townships in Ontario. So I think there'll be a long-term benefit. But change is tough.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:09.760
It's going to take a while to sort of balance it all out. Yeah. And while people are trying

01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:19.280
to balance it all out, technology has advanced tenfolds. And so what are they going to do then?

01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:28.160
They're going to go further and further into smaller communities? I don't think this is

01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:35.040
an escape from technology at all. I think this is an escape from a city that's not

01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:44.320
financially viable. Oh, for sure. Yes. The job, the pay scales are not keeping up with what it cost

01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:52.480
to live there. And I think the fear of COVID and infection in Toronto, I think it's going to be

01:24:52.480 --> 01:25:04.640
a real push last year while a lot of people came up. And I think a lot of people looked at,

01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:11.600
well, they had real property already. Where do I want to live? So I think it was more

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:18.560
moving away from something they were afraid of or something that was unsavoury or something that

01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:24.800
wasn't economically make sense anymore. So capitalise on the money you have in the city,

01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:28.880
liquidate and move up here and buy something for a third of the cost of what it would cost,

01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:33.520
you know, in the city. So if you can swing your business to do that, I think, and a lot of people

01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:38.560
were able to, I don't think it's a move away. I don't think it's a back to the nature thing or

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:44.560
back to the farm thing at all. Certainly not up here because you can't farm up here. It's rocks.

01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:50.000
Rocks, if you want to mine uranium, you'd be all set. But other than that, be careful not renting

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:59.520
out to Iranians then. No, no, Iranians will be mining uranium. Yes, right. Great play on

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:04.560
that. Yes, good one. Well, I mean, similar things have been happening here. A lot of people

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:14.880
are leaving California for Texas, leaving New York for Florida, basically getting out of blue states,

01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:23.120
blue cities, urban areas to either purple or red areas. And interestingly enough, a lot of people

01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:28.000
were saying that, well, they're going to change the balance of, for example, Florida that voted

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:35.600
overwhelmingly for Trump, even though the number of registered Democrats here has been consistently

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:44.640
higher than Republicans. But for the first time ever in the history of, recent history of this

01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:53.600
state, number of registered Republicans surpassed registered Democrats. So we also have a governor

01:26:53.600 --> 01:27:00.080
election coming next year. So Democrats have been running two people for about a year to test the

01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:05.120
water, basically see how they're doing. And none of them were doing good at all. So they're

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:09.520
introducing the third person just a few months away from the election because the first two

01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:14.640
couldn't get any kind of attraction. So something fundamental is changing among a lot of people who

01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:21.440
would have probably said that I'm an independent or moderate Democrat because these insane people

01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:27.920
who are in charge of the system right now, they just gone overboard and people are blown away.

01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:35.040
A lot of people have regrets and stuff about voting for Biden. But again, they're not going to give

01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:40.080
up power and they have enough people to make some kind of a mob and like, well, this is actually

01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:46.080
the right way to do it. Yes, it is a moral position to say that if you're white, you're just

01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:51.360
a, you know, you're just messed up. You're just an evil person by because that's what they're teaching

01:27:51.360 --> 01:28:00.320
kids. This is why a lot of people are, you know, the rising up a lot of parents. So everything is

01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:08.720
changing. But I don't think our policymakers and the system of governance is prepared at all to

01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:14.000
address those kinds of changes. And the changes are going to get, you know, more and more radical

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:18.480
and more significant because technology is evolving exponentially.

01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:28.160
Well, that's my understanding is that's one of the strengths of the US. Because of the independence

01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:37.680
of the states, people will go to where it makes sense to them. And that will set out an agenda

01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:43.280
for the entire country then. Yeah, it's supposed to be, it's supposed to be like this. And the

01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:48.240
problem, the main problem is the federal government has gotten too big and too powerful.

01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:54.880
But now states are, you know, there are some states, not all states, but some states are

01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:58.960
standing their ground basically, like we're not going to do it. We're not going to deal with this.

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:07.280
So like in Florida, they immediately banned vaccine mandates or vaccine passports, not only by like

01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:17.600
companies, but by like government stuff, but also by businesses. So, you know, it's not ideal that

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:24.880
you need to have laws in order to be able to live like some kind of a life with pursuit of liberty.

01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:31.440
But what else are you going to do? These people are insane. They just want to take over everything.

01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:37.520
They want to keep you in masks, two masks, five masks. They're like in California, they had a,

01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:45.040
they had a guidance that it's okay to take your masks when you're taking a bite of your food,

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:49.600
but you have to put your mask back on between bites. And a lot of people are following that.

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:53.680
They're like, what, what, what do you expect then from a system that these people vote in?

01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:58.960
Yeah, no, I, it doesn't make any sense to me to mandate that stuff. If, if you can't put a solid

01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:06.000
case forward, why to do any of these things in this age of science and, and a compelling case

01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:10.800
forward that, and people are willing to adopt it, well, then you've already failed

01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:18.160
and to impose it is going to backfire, I think. And I think you're going to, I think you're going

01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:25.200
to, there's going to be a backlash in Austria for, for what they've done. And I, I just don't

01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:33.120
understand why the recall of the governor of California, how that fell on its face. And I

01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:37.120
would have thought people would have seen through what was going on in California with Newsom and

01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:45.200
the crew, but too far gone. I found that, I found that, I found that, I found that, I found that

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:51.520
too far gone. I found that too far gone. And Hollywood behind it. Tim Draper.

01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:58.720
It's for mandates. Haven't you noticed that there's a good portion of the population that will

01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:04.800
follow every mandate that comes down, no matter how ridiculous it is, not only will they follow

01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:10.320
it, they will enforce it themselves on their fellow citizens. On behalf of the state.

01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:16.560
They don't need the, on behalf of the state. Yeah. Most of the enforcers are other people.

01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:25.680
Yep. So what, so I'm not nearly as optimistic as all you hear that the people will rebel.

01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:31.280
I think no matter what the state does, there'll be statists and authoritarians that follow along

01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:36.240
and enforce it for them. Yeah, absolutely. When I was growing up in Iran, Khomeini asked

01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:42.560
kids to spy on their parents and on their teachers. And teacher is spying on their students,

01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:48.160
basically playing people against each other. And people are more than willing to do that.

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:57.200
Like I said earlier, masks for a lot of people has the same purpose that swastikas had

01:31:57.200 --> 01:32:03.840
for a lot of people during the thirties. You know, it's not that everybody who wore swastika

01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:10.240
were over full on Nazi is that they just wanted to be part of the system. I want to be part of

01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:20.160
the accepted elite. It becomes part of the uniform. It's a coalition signal more than

01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:28.640
absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. So interesting in Florida that you see some people wear masks. Some people

01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:36.480
wear masks. Some people don't wear masks and everybody's getting along. And it's really

01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:41.440
interesting, especially in South Florida, there are a lot of people who are coming from like Cuba

01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:50.560
and Venezuela. So these people have a very good understanding of communism and how it creeps in.

01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:57.840
So I think I mentioned that in one of our talks that Trump's rally in Miami, which was two days

01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:03.840
before the election, it was not called the Trump rally. It was called the rally against communism.

01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:13.520
So, you know, they're not fooling around. They know what's going on. And so they're very accepting

01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:23.200
all the Latinos here. And, you know, for as long as there are some examples, I think the spirit

01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:31.760
of liberty and humanity is very strong, especially when it gets to your kids, that your kids are

01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:39.520
being forced by people to do certain things that is jeopardizing their liberty, their freedom,

01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:46.880
their, you know, your right over their protection. And people are, at least here, I don't know what's

01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:53.600
like how they're going to deal with it in Canada, with all this like CRT stuff in the school system.

01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:59.840
But here there are a lot of parents are waking up to it and they're standing up to it. You know,

01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:06.720
it doesn't matter that they're being labeled as domestic terrorists by the Department of Justice,

01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:12.240
which is just so insane. But they're not just they're not they're not giving up. It's about

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:18.640
their kids. So I think they overreach people on the left, far left. And that's why they're getting

01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:25.920
violent. And they're getting like very obviously coercive and obviously, you know, very overt kind

01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:36.080
of aggression. Yeah, I'm I'm not I'm with David in terms of Canada. I don't see Canada being able

01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:42.880
to pull that off. I mean, I certainly hear a lot of people. And people I talked to are not happy

01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:50.160
with the situation. But certainly my generation is going now what the hell? What can we do anyway?

01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:57.120
Let's you know, let's you've given up your generation given up? Yeah, I think so. I think

01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:06.400
I've seen that big time. I see. I think a lot of people have given up because they just hired.

01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:13.920
Yeah. And that's probably the scariest aspect of this whole COVID thing, that it's drained a lot

01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:20.240
of people for a lot of different reasons. And our society is vulnerable right now. It's also that

01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:28.880
to 1% of Canadians would be around 300,000 people. 1% of Americans would be around 30 million people,

01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:37.040
no, 3 million people. So there's a big difference. Yeah. So 3 million, 3 million people,

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:45.920
if they're hungry, and they're armed, is not a good kind of a perspective for any kind of

01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:52.880
a government to push people towards that. 300,000 people who are not armed.

01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:56.640
It's a very different dynamic.

01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:03.280
But if, if things go pear shaped economically,

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.560
there's going to be a lot of people in Toronto that are going to. Yes.

01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:17.520
I perceive a lot of people in Toronto have been underwritten by the government financially

01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:24.800
and are dependent on them. That can't keep going. So yeah.

01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:31.040
So there's a woman that Biden has nominated here to be in charge of currency,

01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:38.960
that she wants to end private bankings. And she's saying that everybody's account should be

01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:47.200
with the Fed, basically with Federal Reserve. And she's from Soviet Union. Like it's just a comical.

01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:54.160
She was part of a group called the young communists or something. It's just insane.

01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:59.680
But I was thinking a lot of people obviously are speaking out against it. And I don't think that

01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:07.200
I don't think that that's going to happen. But I was just thinking, if this supposed to happen in

01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:13.840
Canada, first of all, who would know? And second, who's going to stop this process? If they say,

01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:23.360
for example, that equivalent of Federal Reserve in the US and Canada, whatever it may be like

01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:29.920
Central Bank of Canada, Bank of Canada, Bank of Canada is going to take over all banks.

01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:37.280
And so all your mortgages, your credit card debts and all that now is owned by Bank of Canada,

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:45.760
which is going to buy it from you in effect. So Bank of Canada is going to become a partial owner

01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:52.480
of your property that you owe some money towards. It can be your credit card, it can be your house

01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:56.320
or anything like that. Well, isn't that nationalization of property?

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:05.920
Yes, exactly what China's done. That's what the CCP did to the Chinese people. They don't own

01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:11.760
anything the government owns. In the end, that's the core of communism that there is no private

01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:25.520
property. You'll be happy. Turns out the World Economic Forum actually sent that message.

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:33.600
Yeah, they also said that Earth benefited from lockdowns. And they did a video about it that how

01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:38.720
beneficial it was to cities for people to stay home and not use cars and all that.

01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:42.800
I'm sure that they're convinced they're doing the good thing and they're doing the right thing.

01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:49.200
That's that's another level of understanding for people that if you disagree this fundamentally

01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:55.200
with someone, you have to consider that it's not that they know or they think they're evil.

01:38:55.200 --> 01:39:02.880
They think they're at the right. No, they're they think that you're the bad guy who is standing up

01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:11.360
against this progress and the path to utopia. How dare you? Right. And once you're brainwashed with

01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:16.720
that, it's a religion. It's an ideology. I mean, there's no way you can convince them otherwise.

01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:24.800
I mean, the Tower of Babel is such a great narrative on what's going on right now. People

01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:31.360
and when Moses came down from the mound and saw everyone had built gold idols and were worshiping

01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:39.520
them, if you lose your faith in anything more important than yourself and you make yourself

01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:49.520
the center of the universe, then you can. People aren't humble enough to say, hmm, I may not be

01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:55.040
right. There's a whole bunch of pieces, you know, as Peterson always says, it's complicated

01:39:55.760 --> 01:40:03.760
and don't think you can fix it. Yeah. But there are a whole group of people have bought into this

01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:11.760
whole environmental religion, social religion, the collectivism. Yeah, it's mind boggling. And

01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:17.520
we're talking about my generation's given up. Well, my generation caused this. I mean, my

01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:24.000
generation spearheaded this in the sixties and seventies. When I look at when I look back at

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:29.760
the seventies now, I see what's happening right now. A mirror image of what happened in the

01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:38.000
seventies, economically, financially, socially, financially, socially, economically,

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:48.800
financially, socially. It's frightening. Only this time, it's global. Last time it was North

01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:57.280
America. Yeah, I don't know how you unpack that. I find it really upsetting. How do you connect

01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:04.560
the dots? What did you see in the seventies that is being recapitulated now? The whole movement,

01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:10.240
the whole social justice movement, everything. I mean, the US was turned upside down.

01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:18.000
The Vietnam War was a catalyst. The environmental movement. I remember all the rallies that we have

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:23.680
to shut down nuclear power because nuclear power was bad. It was evil. It was going to destroy the

01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:29.280
planet. Meanwhile, the oil industry is funneling all that money into those groups to help them,

01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:37.120
to wind them up, to fight against it because they didn't want nuclear power to be running things.

01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:40.240
Was it the oil industry and the petrochemical industry would have lost? They would have big

01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:48.720
time. Were all these things going on? We had the oil embargo out of the Middle East crank up the

01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:54.160
prices. We now have the failure of China economically. That looks like it's going to hit home.

01:41:54.160 --> 01:42:02.240
We had Jimmy Carter. We have Biden. I mean, the parallels are uncanny.

01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:13.680
And we had the whole Nixon thing going on. We had the whole Trump thing going on. And again,

01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:20.000
they aren't 100% equal, but the similarities I find just quite appealing. When I'm looking at

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:28.080
what happened in the 70s and what's happening now, I remember all the lineups all around the US.

01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:36.480
People couldn't get gasoline. They had to get cars because another group of individuals were

01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:43.920
looking out for themselves as the CCP is. I mean, yeah, those are off the top of my head,

01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:52.800
the things that come to mind. So this woman nominee of being in charge of currency wants to

01:42:53.920 --> 01:43:01.760
end private banking. She also said that oil and gas companies going bankrupt is actually a good

01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:08.880
thing because climate change. Yeah, I caught that clip. Couldn't believe it.

01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:14.400
But how do these people even get into power? That's what's so disturbing.

01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:19.840
They've been in power in different levels. It's just that they're coming to the surface now.

01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:31.280
Well, all my cohort of social collectivists ended up as teachers and professors because

01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:34.320
they didn't have what it takes to

01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:42.640
make a living. And they've really doubled down. I mean, you look at that. I mean, it start really

01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:50.800
realistically, the whole socialist movement. I was telling David, I discovered Hayek and

01:43:50.800 --> 01:44:02.880
the road to serfdom. And that is beyond epiphany. I mean, he just lays it out to a T when it comes

01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:08.480
to what's happened. You just listen to the narrative there and what he says. It's

01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:13.840
exponentially worse now than he even thought it was going to be.

01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:17.120
Published in the forties?

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:23.600
55. Yeah, you're right. Late forties and it reached North America. But what I found really

01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:29.600
disturbing is it hit North America in 55. And the outrage in North America against this book

01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:34.800
apparently was epic. The government, people all over the place wanted to get rid of this book

01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:43.600
because it was evil. And that's right in the middle of the McCarthy era. So there was already

01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:50.000
this huge polarity between academics and Hollywood, wanting socialists and collectivism

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:57.360
and socialism and the fight against the capitalists. And then if you roll that back even further,

01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:05.040
I mean, you look at Britain, collectivism was alive and well in Britain. Right back in the

01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:10.240
20s already. And that's why Britain's a mess now because government control of everything.

01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:12.400
And that hasn't ended well.

01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:18.880
Well, one argument is that China fell to the CCP exactly because there were Marxists already

01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:26.240
within the US government. So the pushback wasn't as strong as it should have been because China

01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:35.120
was an ally, you know, leading to that point. But then it fell to the CCP because there were

01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:41.840
people Marxists in the US government. And then after World War II, a lot of Nazis came to the

01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:51.760
US government because Project Paperclip that they brought all the, not all, but many of the high,

01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:58.560
high ranked Nazis to boost American industries, including the space industry that, you know,

01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:08.480
we went basically to the moon because of Nazis. And, you know, it gets rid of the moral high

01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:16.880
ground, but it also shines a light on a very cold, brutal practicality upon which all these

01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:26.960
systems work. And so I think for a lot of people, you know, it's just dreamland, the kind of utopia

01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:33.360
that they're thinking about that, you know, it's like all these communists, so-called communists

01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:40.400
and Marxists on Twitter, these kids, they think like they're going to farm collectively and then

01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:48.640
they're going to go and write poetry. And it's just a ridiculous kind of worldview that obviously,

01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:52.640
you know, all these people that you were saying, they became teachers and professors and all that

01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:57.760
they just put that in their brain. And this is how they see the world. And if you argue with it,

01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:02.640
you're the bad guy. It's not like let's have debates. This is what I was saying to Peter

01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:08.720
Borussian when I had him on the podcast, he had a book, How to Have Impossible Conversations. I was

01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:12.560
like, dude, what will happen if they don't want to have conversations at all?

01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:18.560
And that's where we're at. They don't want to. People have to resign themselves.

01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:23.760
There's a huge court of people. Yeah, really? Yeah. Well, yes, he just did. I saw that.

01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:28.400
He's gone to the University of Boston. Well, he has. Okay, good for him.

01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:37.920
Yeah, the, you know, I listen, I quite often drop in on Gad Saad and watch what he's talking

01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:44.560
about and saying. And I'm quite astounded that Concordia hasn't dumped him yet.

01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:53.120
Has he got tenure? Because I think he does too. Not that it would ultimately matter. You know,

01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:58.960
they will be like, oh, you're like, you're a hyper racist. And that goes against tenure position.

01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:08.240
I mean, he, he is a person of color. He's Jewish and, and he's just self-proclaimed.

01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:21.360
He's just, he's just a Nazi. He's a Jewish Nazi. So ignore everything he has to say. Making sense

01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:31.200
is white supremacy. Making sense is not good. Yeah. Isn't it just, but that, you know, we joke

01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:39.120
about that, but that's a reality. Reality is a joke now. So that's how it is. You know, we're,

01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:47.520
we're living in animal farm. We're living in clown world. Exactly. Yes. James Lindsay.

01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:53.280
I thought, yeah, cause James Lindsay, but I thought clown world was a joke. It's real.

01:48:53.280 --> 01:49:00.400
It's real. Absolutely. Yeah. We were mistaking, thinking that it is not a clown world,

01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:04.960
that there is any, anything serious about it. And so once you recognize as a clown world,

01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:07.360
you just laugh about it. I mean, what else can you do?

01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:15.520
Exactly. That's the position I take these days is it's, it's all so absurd. It's hilarious.

01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:20.800
But friends that have moved here and immigrated from Venezuela are horrible. Well, I mean, yeah,

01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:24.880
they, they see what's happening. They see, you know, as you mentioned in Florida, they up here,

01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:30.000
they see what's happening in Canada and they see a collective communist nightmare unfolding

01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:35.200
and they're debating what to do. And you know, the other option is Europe, but the Europe's even

01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:43.920
worse off. So, um, one can only keep our fingers crossed that at some point something changes in

01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:50.080
this country, but I don't know. David, what were you going to say? You were going to say something.

01:49:55.680 --> 01:50:01.200
Latest is my favorite Twitter fight is now between Bernie Sanders and Elon Musk

01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:09.520
fighting over the future of the space program. I must say I keep forgetting you're still alive.

01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:18.880
Yes. What Sanders, what's Saunders saying? Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders is saying that

01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:25.680
private citizens like Bezos and Musk should not be involved in saying the direction of the space

01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:30.640
program that belongs to the American people and therefore the American government and therefore

01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:39.040
senators like Bernie Sanders, I guess. Yeah. And Congress has about 21% approval rating

01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:48.880
Congress that supposedly rip 21% represent the people. The American people has 21% approval

01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:59.120
rating. So I think at any given situation, Elon Musk is far greater than the entirety of the

01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:05.120
U S Congress, but especially people like Bernie Sanders who've done nothing throughout their lives

01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:14.480
other than leeching out of taxpayers money and saying in the beginning millionaires and billionaires

01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:18.560
and then he became a millionaire. He dropped the millionaires. Now it's only billionaires

01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:25.760
who has to pay the most taxes. Like Elon Musk probably should pay zero taxes. Just keep doing

01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:32.400
what you're doing, dude. Single-handedly is advancing the human experience in all different.

01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:38.160
I just heard today that they're going to release Tesla phones that is going to work with Starlink.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:44.000
I'm like, hell yeah, man. What has Bernie Sanders done recently?

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:48.000
Other than becoming like a flavor of an ice cream Ben and Jerry.

01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:56.240
So the problem is people like Bernie Sanders who are throwing rocks and obstacles on the way of

01:51:56.240 --> 01:52:02.720
someone like Elon Musk to what? To give handouts to people that they require their votes.

01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:16.480
I guess the other part of the discussion though is when you have companies like Amazon that own the

01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:23.360
government, then that becomes a problem as well. So there's stuff that has to be fixed, but

01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:27.840
destroying capitalism and private enterprise is not a solution.

01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:30.160
How does Amazon own the government?

01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:38.080
They have a huge influence on policy in the government.

01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:39.200
But how?

01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:44.400
By lobbying. Lobbying and funding, money.

01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:46.640
Politicians doing influence peddling?

01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:47.680
I agree.

01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:54.080
Politicians, I think that's where the, if there's a problem there, it's in the politicians.

01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:58.240
No, I agree where you're going. A hundred percent, David. I agree with you.

01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:00.560
The root of the problem are the politicians and the government.

01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:09.600
And that they're enabling and the private, you know, private wealthy corporations are

01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:12.800
taking advantage. Just the way they did in the 1800s with the railways. I mean,

01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:20.720
that it's the same kind of game going on. But that has to be on the table, right?

01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:26.400
And I think people are seeing that. They're seeing the influence peddling going on.

01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:31.440
They're seeing what the hell was that? What the heck happened in Portland?

01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:36.880
I mean, how could anyone have witnessed what happened in Portland and not go,

01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:42.560
something is horribly, horribly broken here with the government, that that was allowed to happen.

01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:46.800
So I think people are seeing all these things. And

01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:55.920
hopefully they're recognizing, as David pointed out, that the problem is not with,

01:53:55.920 --> 01:54:01.040
you know, capitalism. The problem is with government and central planning and control

01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:07.840
that manifests. But the collectivists keep pointing at capitalists as the core of the problem.

01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:15.680
Of course they are. The Iranian government also is blaming Israel and United States for all their

01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:20.400
problems. You know, for as long as you have an enemy, you don't have to take responsibility

01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:31.920
over your failures. And capitalism is fine in the crypto land. And the only example of free market

01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:39.040
that I can think of is darknet. You know, otherwise the rest of the markets are manipulated

01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:48.320
in one way or another. I guess we were talking earlier to bring it full circle. We were talking

01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:57.440
about tipping points in terms of moving to cryptocurrency. The whole stock market and the

01:54:57.440 --> 01:55:04.320
financial institutions, that's going to be the legacy environment that has to sort of slide

01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:11.440
and capitulate in some way. I mean, there's all sorts of solutions for central, you know,

01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:16.240
for the financial and for the stock market that would lend themselves. But once it's

01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:19.920
once it's turned into a crypto environment, that's going to be much harder to gain.

01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:30.320
You know, this is like religious institutions who are attempting to become transhumanists,

01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:39.920
like Mormon Transhumanist Association, or, you know, whatever sect of Christianity that

01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:48.080
would use or attempt to use AI in order to evangelize Christianity. There is no need

01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:58.080
to carry out or carry on a lot of this stuff that humans have come up with. Thousands of years ago,

01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:04.720
concepts that we have come up with, and all they do is slowing us down. That's one thing. The other

01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:11.760
thing is there is no central authority to define anything for this collective that is humanity.

01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:22.000
So we lack the point of alignment. And we have ran out of time, I think, to establish any kind of

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:28.560
a central point of alignment. People have tried throughout history, you know, all these religions

01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:34.880
attempts have been made in order to like, our God is the only God, so just worship him. That's the

01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:39.200
higher, you know, that's the highest level of authority. But now that the concept has been

01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:45.600
entirely broken, shattered, anybody who, you know, is on TikTok and has 100,000 followers,

01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:52.160
for example, you you have authority to, you know, convince a bunch of people to see the world in a

01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:59.360
certain kind of a way. And so centralization, any variation of it is completely meaningless.

01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:05.760
Of course, banks want to play a role in this digital revolution. But the point of this digital

01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:14.720
revolution is that we need to move beyond, for example, the central banking system or central

01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:23.680
governance system. And, you know, it, it expands from there to all different aspects of our

01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:29.200
experience as humans, including our cultures, including our ethics and morality, including

01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:37.520
of including everything else that we have taken for granted as some kind of a default state.

01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:44.800
No, those are all, you know, been disrupted. A lot of them have been shattered. And they don't have

01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:52.240
that good of an argument. You know, being traditionalists and isolationists as some kind

01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:58.400
of a counter to technological advancement and growth, that's not a solution. That's just a cope.

01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:06.880
And it's probably a, you know, not a very successful cope. So I think that's where we are. We are just

01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:14.240
completely disconnected, because we are we are just pursuing different kind of different kind of

01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:21.760
objectives. How is it possible for people who believe in reason and truth and factuality to

01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:28.880
live side by side by with people or share resources with people who believe a politician who come and

01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:35.280
say on national television that it's more important to be morally right than to be factually

01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:44.000
correct? I mean, how how are you going to ever come up with any kind of common ground with any

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:45.680
of these people? It's just impossible.

01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:49.360
Do you think that the dreams of utopia are ever going to go away, though?

01:58:50.240 --> 01:58:56.400
That's what I think all these ideologies have in common, like the socialists and this

01:58:57.280 --> 01:59:06.320
social justice people and, and even, I guess, once they have faith in democracy, they, but they all

01:59:06.320 --> 01:59:13.120
have in common is kind of a vision of a monoculture. Like, if, if only everyone thought the way we did,

01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:19.840
the world would be great. Right. So if communists took over the world, or if democracies took over

01:59:19.840 --> 01:59:26.160
the world, or if Christians took over the world, if as long as you just had one monoculture, things

01:59:26.160 --> 01:59:30.560
would just be fine. So I think that's the kind of vision that we all have in common.

01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:36.160
If Christians took over the world, if as long as you just had one monoculture, things would just be

01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:45.040
fine. I think a lot of people retain that vision, even if they don't realize it. It's implicit in

01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:52.240
their belief system. It is, it doesn't require that much thinking and understanding. And it also

01:59:52.240 --> 02:00:02.160
immediately give you the feeling of righteousness. Right. Yeah, because then it becomes a global

02:00:02.160 --> 02:00:10.720
battle that's good and evil against everyone else. Good and evil. Well, I don't think it's going to

02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:16.400
go away. But I also don't think that it's consistent with nature of reality and everything,

02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:24.640
because everything, the nature of reality is quantum. Right. But the way out of that, I think,

02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:31.120
is to grow up, to become more mature and understand that there will always be diversity. And if your

02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:34.480
system can't handle diversity, then it's bound to fail. They're not going to do that.

02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:46.480
Maybe not everyone, but as a, don't you think humans as a species were less mature at some

02:00:46.480 --> 02:00:52.000
stage in the past? We've grown up somewhat in the last few hundred years.

02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:57.920
But what is the goal again? I think it's important to...

02:00:57.920 --> 02:01:05.920
The goal is to live in harmony. Yeah. Is that a goal though? I think, well, the goal for me,

02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:13.360
or I think the goal that we should have is civilization, meaning not the now, but the

02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:20.480
process of becoming more civilized, meaning less violence and more cooperation over time and space.

02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:26.320
So I think we can grow up and become more civilized. We're a long ways from there right now,

02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:30.480
obviously. We're not very civilized. We're not very mature as a species.

02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:35.040
But did enlightenment open the door to that? Yeah, I think so.

02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:40.160
And then when we, as Nietzsche says, when we walked away from when God was dead,

02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:46.160
all of a sudden, there was a vacuum in our society and it got filled with

02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:53.360
totalitarian regimes of Europe of the early 1900s. And communism made sure it squished

02:01:53.360 --> 02:02:00.000
anything left of Christianity. So... Christianity is still going strong.

02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:03.440
Well, Christianity is being revived.

02:02:05.200 --> 02:02:11.120
I hear that, but not amongst... I suspect you're not going to find a lot of Christians amongst

02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:19.120
the CT, the CRTs or the environmentalists. No, they're against, they have their own religion.

02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:22.560
That's right. It is a religion.

02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:27.680
Yeah. So I, but I think that's, because when I talk

02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:35.440
from conservatives, traditional conservative people, I talk to listen.

02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:40.000
The, the people that are on the hard left don't know how to listen.

02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:45.680
So they're so ensconced in what they think is right. I mean, they're lost in their religion.

02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:53.200
Well, which group has made advances and gained ground? Conservatives or the far left?

02:02:55.440 --> 02:02:57.920
Currently, or over the last couple hundred years?

02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:05.280
Uh, like who's in power right now? Who's in power right now?

02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:12.480
Okay. What are you saying? I'm saying that what we consider to be a future

02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:20.080
could very well be interpreted as a bug within a system. Yes. Because it is the openness of the

02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:24.480
system. And that's what we're talking about. And that's what we're talking about.

02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:33.040
Yes. Because it is the openness of the system that has allowed something like this to grow to begin

02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:42.960
with. Because I can't think of any other country that is a serious country to deal with people who

02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:49.360
are very openly are saying that the foundation of your country is evil. It's not that we have

02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:56.240
a problem with this statue or that statue, the institution, the building block of your civilization

02:03:56.240 --> 02:04:04.160
is evil. And it should be destroyed. And they they're not willing to even provide any kind of an

02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:11.600
coherent alternative other than utopia very vague, which again is on you know, by design,

02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:17.840
you don't want to you don't want to settle on any specific kind of objective because you want to be

02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:23.440
able to move the goalposts. And you know, we look at it and like, well, what what kind of scumbags

02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:31.040
would be doing that they're doing it and they're gaining power. So listening to other people hasn't

02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:40.000
necessarily worked that well for conservatives. Right, I agree. But I think, as we mentioned

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:47.840
earlier, I think there's a there is the force pushing this along. There are agendas and there

02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:55.280
there are bad actors from other nations that are encouraging this and underwriting it and funding

02:04:55.280 --> 02:05:04.400
it. So you have this generation that are crippled because of our educational system, and don't have,

02:05:04.400 --> 02:05:10.400
as David points out, the wherewithal to sort of say, I'm an individual, and I have to listen

02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:14.960
to other people. And we have to come up with, you know, we have to work things out. Because

02:05:16.160 --> 02:05:22.080
traditionally, it actually worked that way in North America. You know, just like in Florida,

02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:30.240
I mean, someone wants to wear a mask, fine, someone doesn't find. So I know there are

02:05:30.240 --> 02:05:37.600
there are parts of the world that are making it work. I mean, UK is not allowing mass mandates,

02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:42.400
mandatory vaccines or anything, because the people just wouldn't stand for it. We're in a

02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:48.160
country like Austria, everyone's doubled down on it. So I guess you'd have to look at what's

02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:54.400
different about Florida, what's different about the UK, that they're able to withstand some of

02:05:54.400 --> 02:06:02.960
this bizarreness. I mean, I, the UK seems to have been far more effective against CRT than we have

02:06:02.960 --> 02:06:09.040
been in certainly in Canada and in parts of North America. But Virginia stepped up to the plate,

02:06:09.680 --> 02:06:15.040
and said, No, I don't think we want to do that anymore. So I guess it would be interesting to

02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:24.560
try to distill the difference there. I'm not, I don't know what it is, are people more grounded

02:06:24.560 --> 02:06:32.320
in traditional value system, be it Christianity or anything else that community? Or is it because

02:06:33.360 --> 02:06:38.560
the educational system in these communities hasn't been able to isn't as entrenched in,

02:06:38.560 --> 02:06:44.400
in the postmodernist world? I don't know. I don't understand. I mean, I would have thought

02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:48.480
something like the UK and what they've been through, would have been far more vulnerable to

02:06:48.480 --> 02:06:55.120
groupthink. And because of the way they've been socialized there, but apparently they're not. So

02:06:55.120 --> 02:07:01.840
what's with that? I don't know. But I think there are aspects of our Western society that is standing

02:07:01.840 --> 02:07:06.880
up quite remarkably well. I think you look at countries like Poland, Poland, Poland,

02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:12.640
you look at countries like Poland, and they're going, No, we took all those Ukrainian refugees,

02:07:12.640 --> 02:07:18.240
we paid our dues, we're not going to not we're not going to knuckle under the EU. And then the EU

02:07:18.240 --> 02:07:23.920
doubles down and calls them racist and calls them fascists. And you know, that's the best they can

02:07:23.920 --> 02:07:31.440
do in terms of responding to them. So yeah, I'm hopeful. I'm not particularly hopeful on where

02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:40.160
Canada is going. But certainly, if you go to Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, there's

02:07:40.160 --> 02:07:48.960
a lot of pushback. The oil industry in Alberta is just there. They're ecstatic that oil is $100 a

02:07:48.960 --> 02:07:54.240
barrel again. Because in spite of any efforts Trudeau is going to do, the oil industry in Alberta

02:07:54.240 --> 02:08:04.560
is launching again. So I see little glimmers. And but I don't understand why it's working in

02:08:04.560 --> 02:08:11.600
some places and not working in other places. I don't know. But I think that would be a worthwhile

02:08:11.600 --> 02:08:17.520
understanding that. It's just that people are different. People have always been different.

02:08:17.520 --> 02:08:26.960
And now we see it more directly how different people are. But I'm sure there's Democrats,

02:08:26.960 --> 02:08:33.360
I know of Democrats, hardcore Democrats in Florida. As well as you know, I remember driving

02:08:33.360 --> 02:08:42.160
going to pick up a pizza in Sebring and looking at, you know, the Bible Institute and the firing

02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:48.960
the gun range there. And the slogans on the front of it and just chuckling and so

02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:55.760
why does it work there when you have the diversity? Yeah, but it's not like those Democrats are fine

02:08:55.760 --> 02:09:01.520
with it. There are many Democrats here who are not fine with it or can cannot wait to get rid of

02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:09.680
DeSantis and to implement lockdowns and mandates and all that. And I have no trouble with that.

02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:13.760
As long as there's a balanced push from both sides, because the conversation has to be had.

02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:19.520
Florida is in this position exactly because there hasn't been a balance to push on both sides.

02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:28.640
This is a red, red state that got even redder because of Trump. And, you know, like culturally,

02:09:29.520 --> 02:09:34.320
people are red. And so a lot of people who registered Democrat, they ended up voting for

02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:41.280
Trump too, because, you know, as I said, they realize that, you know, or they realize that this

02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:46.560
is not about Trump. This is about changing the entire dynamic of a relationship between people

02:09:46.560 --> 02:09:51.600
and the government. But there are also Democrats here who can't stand it, as I said, who cannot

02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:56.640
stand everything that is going on. Like this is the worst place to be. DeSantis sucks. Look at how

02:09:56.640 --> 02:10:03.280
many people have died. And their argument is not that now the numbers of cases in Florida is

02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:08.080
I think the lowest or the second lowest in the country, their argument would be, well,

02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:13.920
just imagine how many people didn't have to die. If you had done lockdowns and so how are you ever

02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:19.280
going to, you know, compromise with these people? Just don't give them power. Well, that's how it

02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:27.120
works. You don't give them power. You do not give them power. But the conversation, okay, well, I

02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:31.440
would argue the conversations were going on. That's why Democrats moved to the Republicans.

02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:35.280
So the people were caught talking amongst themselves, and they're absorbing and analyzing

02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:40.080
what's going on, be it viscerally, or be it scientifically, and drawing conclusions.

02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:46.160
But this is not like majority of Democrats, as you said, it is mind blowing that the recall

02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:53.200
election in California after all of this failed. Right. So in a state like California, those who

02:10:53.200 --> 02:11:00.800
are leaving are the sane ones. So the state is being left behind, when the state is being left

02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:08.000
behind, with people who are perfectly fine in San Francisco, that up to $1,000 if you steal is not

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:17.280
even a misdemeanor. So all the stores are shutting down at like 4pm. Because theft is out of control.

02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:24.320
They're homeless all over that city. The crazy people walking all around, and people who stay

02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:29.280
there are fine with it. Like, well, we are equal. This is how it is. They're fucked up because of

02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:37.200
us, I guess. So we have to pay the price. But that's the question I'm asking. Why are people

02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:45.520
in California, why were people in Florida who are Democrats able to make a logical decision

02:11:45.520 --> 02:11:50.000
that we know what's going to be better in the long run? And why were people in California not

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:58.400
able to make that decision? What's different? Because the white progressive women in California

02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:07.920
and New York, mainly, and you know, if you look at the the polls, almost always consistently, the

02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:17.600
highest percentage of approval of Biden administration is white women who are college educated.

02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:26.560
So right there, they're college educated, they've gone to college and gotten a degree in feminist

02:12:26.560 --> 02:12:34.480
hair dyeing, or gender studies or whatever. And you know, they became professors and they give,

02:12:34.480 --> 02:12:38.800
you know, given grants to other people who are interested in feminist hair dyeing and gender

02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:46.160
studies. And you know, that's their worldview. They talk among each other about it. And you know,

02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:52.400
it's a cult. It's a cult. But then that hasn't that hasn't happened in Florida, Florida.

02:12:52.400 --> 02:13:01.120
There is a pushback culturally from the opposite side. So it's not like they have monopoly of

02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:06.160
power in Florida to be able to implement whatever they want in the school, whatever they wanted,

02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:15.360
like the cultural level, education level. What I'm saying is that there is a supremacy of power

02:13:15.360 --> 02:13:21.040
towards Republicans and conservatives in Florida. But what's special about Florida is that a lot of

02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:27.680
people, they're not like Trump Republicans, but they also are seeing that Democrats are moving

02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:33.680
towards a very bad place that this is just the beginning of it. Even Democrats who live,

02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:38.560
many of the Democrats who live in Florida, because they're, you know, they could be Jewish,

02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:46.640
they could be, again, from like, South American countries, or Eastern European countries,

02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:54.320
that they socially were liberal. But this is not about liberal and conservative. This is about

02:13:54.320 --> 02:14:01.280
American and anti-American, and they can see it. But a lot of people in California, they don't see

02:14:01.280 --> 02:14:08.880
it, they see what they're being promised as the ideal situation as an ideal outcome. This equity

02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:18.480
that they're being promised is an ideal outcome for them. So using David's suggestion, Florida has

02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:24.080
managed to evolve up a little bit higher than the people in California. They're still stuck in an

02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:29.280
old paradigm. There must be a reason that a lot of these VC people from Silicon Valley, they move to

02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:36.960
Miami. You know, there must be a quality about like Austin and Miami, mostly Miami.

02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:42.240
Well, part of, I think for the corporations, it's a lot of it's because of the tax. I mean, right,

02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:48.480
they were, if you sell the business, they were dinging you horribly for taxes in California.

02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:54.560
There's no doubt that California has become a hostile environment for technology companies.

02:14:54.560 --> 02:15:00.400
Yeah, and also an authoritarian state. I had Tim Draper on, this is a couple years ago,

02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:08.560
the 50th episode of this podcast, that he collected signatures more than required to split,

02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:16.640
to put it as a prop on the ballot to split California into three. I think it was like

02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:23.760
southern, northern and central and run it in a decent kind of way. I think he required like

02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:31.760
600 signatures. He collected about 800,000 and he said that the Supreme Court of California just

02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:38.480
tossed it. It was like five people or six people, he was saying, overruled the will of like 800,000

02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:45.200
plus people. So he was saying that we're no longer in a democracy. And this was like, I don't know,

02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:51.920
three, four years ago, maybe that, you know, he's lost faith in both parties. He lost faith in

02:15:51.920 --> 02:15:56.320
you know, he's lost faith in both parties. He's no longer a Republican or a Democrat,

02:15:56.320 --> 02:16:04.560
because this is just ridiculous. And, you know, I have to laugh because it was never democracy.

02:16:06.400 --> 02:16:12.400
Yeah, the illusion of freedom has been collapsed. John McAfee was also saying like,

02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:18.320
a lot of people are sheep. And I was like, well, they're voting those still. And it was like,

02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:24.240
well, lucky for us, their vote don't matter really. Like that dude had, you know, his eyes

02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:33.840
were open long before many others. He's also crazy. Very crazy. Or are we the crazy ones to put up

02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:51.440
with this bullshit? Who knows that book, somebody wrote a book based on his secret tapes.

02:16:54.480 --> 02:17:00.480
Yeah, really? Yeah. Apparently, he did this interview with this one guy, Scottish guy, I think,

02:17:00.480 --> 02:17:03.520
that hours and hours of tape, and he made it into a book.

02:17:08.400 --> 02:17:15.920
Yeah, so the fact that he had a tattoo saying that if I ever appear to commit suicide, don't believe

02:17:15.920 --> 02:17:20.080
it. I wouldn't put it beyond him to commit suicide.

02:17:20.080 --> 02:17:29.600
Totally. Yeah, I don't, I don't think he was the kind of person who would stand by anything.

02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:36.720
By anything, which which is a very, very fluid kind of a situation to be insane with Trump.

02:17:36.720 --> 02:17:40.240
Like, are you standing by what you said? And like, I'm not standing by anything.

02:17:40.240 --> 02:17:41.840
So how are you going to be the president?

02:17:44.880 --> 02:17:48.720
Well, yeah, I would have thought McAfee would have had a dead man switch somewhere.

02:17:49.280 --> 02:17:53.600
There are a lot of theories about it. You know, that building that collapsed in Miami?

02:17:53.600 --> 02:17:58.960
Oh, there was a building. Oh, yeah.

02:18:00.720 --> 02:18:09.440
They were saying that McAfee had had a unit there. And it collapsed because his the content of his

02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:13.520
dead man switch basically was there. So there are a lot of conspiracy theories going around.

02:18:14.480 --> 02:18:19.520
But I mean, who knows, you know, one man's conspiracy theory is another man's doctrine.

02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:21.840
Yes.

02:18:27.440 --> 02:18:30.720
All right, folks, we went on for how long? A while.

02:18:31.760 --> 02:18:33.840
Oh, my God. Two and a half hours.

02:18:33.840 --> 02:18:37.680
We can wrap it up if you guys want or we can just keep on going for a little bit more.

02:18:40.400 --> 02:18:41.440
Any last words?

02:18:43.520 --> 02:18:47.840
What's the one thing we didn't haven't talked about that we should be that should be talked about?

02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:50.640
But one last topic that we've missed.

02:18:54.320 --> 02:18:58.240
Well, China, Taiwan, that's on the table, but I mean, it's probably going to happen.

02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:04.240
Yeah, and they've threatened Australia now officially.

02:19:04.880 --> 02:19:09.280
So I mean, the dudes and, you know, official emperor now.

02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:17.840
So this is the difference between uber centralized country and this mess that we're dealing with in

02:19:17.840 --> 02:19:28.960
the West. None is perfect. But maybe it's as the result of this conflict that something else will

02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:36.400
emerge that is fundamentally different and is what is needed in order to take us to the next level.

02:19:36.400 --> 02:19:42.400
You know, even like postmodernism can be seen as a philosophical bridge between where we've been to

02:19:42.400 --> 02:19:47.680
where we're going with respect to metaverse and all that, and this ability to subjectively create

02:19:47.680 --> 02:19:49.680
the world that you want in your own image.

02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:52.800
I think that's true.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:59.280
Well, I think India is really doing a lot of soul searching now that China's taken over and

02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:10.000
reestablished the air base in Iran and in Afghanistan and is trying to weaponize Pakistan

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:14.480
because I think China wants India out of the game when it goes for Taiwan.

02:20:14.480 --> 02:20:21.840
Yeah, and not only not only like financially and manufacturer wise, but also philosophically.

02:20:21.840 --> 02:20:28.640
India is very well prepared for this decentralization at the philosophical level.

02:20:28.640 --> 02:20:30.640
It's already a decentralized society.

02:20:32.640 --> 02:20:35.440
Well, I never thought of that. That's yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

02:20:37.120 --> 02:20:45.440
And Australia and Japan are working very hard to do business arrangements and set up a commerce

02:20:45.440 --> 02:20:49.440
between themselves and India and moving away from China.

02:20:49.440 --> 02:20:52.240
So, you know, it's very obvious what needs to be done.

02:20:52.240 --> 02:20:55.040
China bans Bitcoin. We have to double down on Bitcoin.

02:20:55.840 --> 02:21:00.640
China bans free Internet. We have to double down on free Internet.

02:21:01.440 --> 02:21:09.040
So they have to go against human nature because their entire society depends on social safety net.

02:21:09.840 --> 02:21:17.040
And, you know, the difference is if like 1% of Americans are unemployed, for example,

02:21:17.040 --> 02:21:21.040
it's not that big of a deal. 1% unemployed in China is a revolution.

02:21:22.240 --> 02:21:29.040
So, you know, there are weaknesses and strength on both sides, but none again, none is perfect.

02:21:29.040 --> 02:21:31.840
But at the same time, we have technological solutions.

02:21:31.840 --> 02:21:38.640
It's really stupid to think about this system of governance when we have smart contracts,

02:21:38.640 --> 02:21:43.840
when we have blockchain, when we have, you know, models right now like Miami.

02:21:43.840 --> 02:21:48.640
What this dude, the mayor is doing, what Elon Musk is doing.

02:21:48.640 --> 02:21:56.640
I remember last year, it was the same day that people start burning places across the country

02:21:56.640 --> 02:21:58.240
because of George Floyd.

02:21:58.240 --> 02:22:05.040
It was the same day that SpaceX launched the first first launch with astronauts.

02:22:05.040 --> 02:22:06.640
It was a test dragon.

02:22:07.440 --> 02:22:11.840
And I went to see it and on the way back, I was just thinking, man, how obvious it is.

02:22:11.840 --> 02:22:17.440
And America has a very clear choice between cancel culture and building culture.

02:22:17.440 --> 02:22:20.240
And this is exactly the story with China and us too.

02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:22.240
China is about cancel culture.

02:22:22.240 --> 02:22:28.240
We have to focus and double down on building culture, you know, rather than trying to change

02:22:28.240 --> 02:22:32.240
the system like Buckminster Fuller said.

02:22:32.240 --> 02:22:42.240
Buckminster Fuller said, you create an alternative that make the existing system obsolete.

02:22:42.240 --> 02:22:44.240
Yep, just the way.

02:22:44.240 --> 02:22:46.240
Agreed.

02:22:46.240 --> 02:22:47.040
All right, great.

02:22:47.040 --> 02:22:50.240
Since we all agree, this is the best way to get it.

02:22:50.240 --> 02:23:06.240
Yeah.

02:23:20.240 --> 02:23:24.240
Thank you.
