0	3120	People's concept of what's hap- what happy is is like so fucked up.
3120	4920	That's why I have something against happiness.
12920	18000	Hello, and welcome to the third episode of Neo Human Podcast.
18000	19160	I'm Agabahari.
19160	24200	You can follow me on Twitter and Instagram at Agologist.
24200	29800	And you can follow the show on Live in Limbo at liveinlimbo.com.
29800	43120	So for the third episode, I'm here with Kurt Jaimungal, who is a physics and math grad
43120	48240	from University of Toronto, and he is a filmmaker now.
48240	53320	So when did you graduate from a physics and math program?
53320	57480	Like I spent way too long in undergrad.
57480	59680	Why did you choose that field?
59760	61800	I love- I still love physics and math.
61800	69960	When I was a kid, my dad would make me learn math and chess and stuff at like a really
69960	70960	young age.
70960	72760	He would like pressure me and I hated that.
72760	77400	And I didn't like him at a young age because of that because it was like a lot of pressure.
77400	80400	Even I remember I wanted to watch The Simpsons one time.
80400	85840	And so I was playing- he would make me play blindfolded chess with my sister.
85840	86840	So I would be blindfolded.
86840	92680	My sister is allowed to be not blindfolded because she wasn't as good as me.
92680	94240	So I would be blindfolded.
94240	97280	And then I was just making mistakes on purpose because I knew the new Simpsons episode was
97280	100440	coming on and my dad saw this and he physically cut the cable.
100440	102280	And then I went upstairs crying.
102280	105280	I went upstairs crying and my mom woke up and then she's like, Paul.
105280	107600	My dad's like, Paul, what are you doing to the child?
107600	110280	She's like, he's like, Christ, that's my mom's name.
110280	111280	Just yelling at each other.
111280	113800	And then I'm crying in my room and I don't have TV.
113800	114800	I can't do anything.
114800	115800	I just have to sit in the dark.
116760	121600	Yeah, so I was just kind of pressured from a young age to do like analytical things.
121600	124440	Was your dad a- or is your dad an academic?
124440	129440	Oh, well he's a teacher, but of woodworking.
129440	134120	Although he studied chemistry in university.
134120	138320	He just wanted his kids- like, you know, when I was- even my brother- my brother went through
138320	139800	worse than what I did.
139800	142280	So you had two brothers, one sister?
142280	143280	One brother, two sisters.
143520	144520	It's like two boys, two girls.
144520	145520	Oh, okay.
145520	146520	Yeah.
146520	151720	And like when I was a kid, it's that classic thing of like the parents say, like, you'll
151720	152720	thank me later.
152720	157600	And I really- I wish that he was harder on me because it really helped me out throughout
157600	158600	the rest of my life.
158600	159600	Oh, yeah?
159600	164200	Because, you know, I was learning- I was learning calculus in grade three.
164200	168840	Like actual calculus and integral calculus, not just regular calculus.
168840	174560	So when you talk about your childhood, would you categorize it as a good or bad childhood?
174560	175560	Good.
175560	178000	I'd say it's pretty good.
178000	179000	I'd say it's pretty good.
179000	183440	Aside from that stuff, I had a pretty good childhood.
183440	186120	Which was bad because it didn't prepare me for like the crappy adulthood.
186120	187120	Was it in Canada?
187120	188120	Yeah.
188120	189120	Yeah.
189120	190120	Everything's in Canada.
190120	191120	Yeah.
191120	192120	In Toronto.
192120	193120	Yeah, in Toronto.
193120	194120	That's awesome.
194120	195120	Born and raised.
195120	196120	Basically born and raised.
196120	200800	But I mean, I came here when I was like two months old or three months old.
200800	201800	Yeah.
201800	202800	Yeah.
202800	204320	And then I always liked math and physics.
204320	208400	I always liked math in particular.
208400	209400	And then physics.
209400	211760	I forgot how physics came about.
211760	217360	I think my brother was explaining something to me about quantum fluctuations one time.
217360	220600	This was when Blockbuster was still around.
220600	226080	And then I remember finding that fascinating that particles can come in and out of existence.
226080	228240	Like just like that.
228240	231440	Because all I knew was that you cannot create or destroy anything.
231440	233960	And then he's telling me, no, you can.
233960	236080	It's just in very small time scales you can.
236080	237400	And it happens all the time.
237400	238400	Happening in front of us right now.
238400	240000	It happens in between atoms.
240000	243320	Like anytime there's empty space, that's happening.
243320	244320	And that fascinated me.
244320	247240	I think I just from there, I always looked up like physics.
247240	249840	Yeah, so I always loved physics.
249880	259280	When you say coming in and going out of existence, in existence it's very tangible.
259280	261600	It's understandable.
261600	268240	What is out of existence from the point of view of a person who is passionate about physics
268240	271720	and has studied physics?
271720	273520	Let's say you have empty spaces.
273520	274520	There's nothing in it.
274520	275520	Right.
275520	278840	This is a vacuum is what they call it.
278840	282680	And then so you're looking at this vacuum and there's nothing.
282680	288240	But then what happens is out of this nothing, you'll see an electron and then an anti-electron
288240	289800	appear and then collide.
289800	294560	An anti-electron, whenever antimatter collides with regular matter, matter will destroy itself.
294560	297040	Usually it destroys itself in energy.
297040	299920	So a photon will be emitted.
299920	308000	But in these little anti-particle pairs, they'll come in and out of existence like this constantly.
308160	312680	I'm making a gesture with my hands that no one can see.
312680	319440	Yeah, so there's nothing, they come and then they go like, yeah.
319440	323280	Where are they coming from?
323280	331040	It doesn't mean that they're coming from somewhere, it's just that it's like the laws say that,
331040	334120	okay, you've heard of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, right?
334120	335440	Yes, but say it anyways.
335880	341740	This basically comes from Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which says you can't simultaneously
341740	353840	measure a particle's position with 100% accuracy and know its momentum with any accuracy.
353840	357660	There's a trade-off between knowing how sure are you of its position and how sure are you
357660	358880	of its momentum.
358880	362720	If you try and measure one with a certain degree of accuracy, it will limit the other's
362720	365080	accuracy.
365080	371760	So people normally kind of say it like, imagine you're playing like billiard balls, I mean,
371760	377640	you're playing pool, and let's say it's dark, okay, so you can't see the balls but you can
377640	381200	only shoot another ball at the ball that you're trying to measure.
381200	386000	You're trying to figure out where is this white ball, let's say, okay?
386000	389200	So the only way you can know is if you interact with it by throwing other balls.
389200	393120	So usually that's photons, we're looking at something, we're interacting with it by looking
393120	394120	at it, right?
394160	396800	Photons are being emitted to it.
396800	401120	So let's say we're trying to find out where this white ball is.
401120	404480	We don't know, the white ball could be moving, it could have momentum, momentum just like
404480	407820	velocity and speed, okay?
407820	410880	It could be moving or it could be still and we don't know where on the board it is, so
410880	411880	we're just shooting.
411880	416200	Let's say we shoot it with the ball.
416200	417280	This is such a bad analogy.
417280	427000	So basically, the harder you hit the white ball, let's say I use my billiard ball to
427000	431640	hit the white ball really hard, okay, and the white ball goes flying off somewhere but
431640	436000	my ball stays right where the white ball was, okay, like I just hit it and then my ball
436000	440840	stays and the white ball goes there, then I'll know like, oh, I have a pretty good idea
440840	445080	of where the position was of that white ball but now I don't know its momentum anymore
445480	447760	because I just changed it.
447760	455720	Whereas before, I could kind of like go very softly to it and let's say the white ball
455720	461120	is moving and I go very softly with my billiard ball to hit it, my billiard ball will move
461120	466600	a little bit and I won't really know its position but that's such a bad analogy.
466600	470960	But anyway, it's like basically, there's a trade-off.
470960	474200	But then here's the thing that most people don't know is that the trade-off doesn't happen
474200	478040	because we suck at observing or there's some human thing.
478040	483640	The trade-off is even the atom itself doesn't know its own momentum and position accurately.
483640	484640	That's what's the interesting thing.
484640	491400	Is this the same thing with when it's being observed, it behaves as a particle and when
491400	493480	it's not observed, it behaves as waves?
493480	498200	No, it behaves as both even when you observe it and when you don't observe it.
498200	503960	What they're saying is it lives in a superposition of like up and down, left and right, all these
504000	506720	things simultaneously until you observe it, then it chooses one.
506720	507720	Right.
507720	515800	That's just an interpretation of quantum mechanics that like that...
515800	520560	The equations kind of imply that but it's just an implication, right?
520560	524200	Like there's many different other implications, different interpretations of what the equations
524200	525200	mean.
525200	529400	All we know is these equations are the most accurate equations in all of science.
529520	539360	They're the most tested of any sort of scientific field even more than cellular biology or whatever.
539360	544320	These equations are correct down to the degree of accuracy of like, let's say you're trying
544320	551480	to measure the earth and your measurement is within a marble, like within a penny's
551480	554360	sort of length of like the radius of the earth.
554360	555780	That's your error.
555780	558980	That's also how accurate we can measure certain things quantum mechanically.
558980	561660	Like of course we just go down to the scale of that.
561660	563900	How long has it been since we developed this?
563900	565700	That's 100 years now.
565700	566700	100 years.
566700	574740	Basically, what I'm understanding from this conversation so far is that physics has attempted
574740	583460	to explain the world and life and the universe and has succeeded in your opinion and maybe
583580	588260	my opinion and in the opinion of a lot of people has succeeded greatly but there is
588260	590460	a huge amount that we still don't know about.
590460	594740	There are things that we don't know that we don't know.
594740	601660	Is physics in general and physics departments around Canada and United States getting the
601660	606500	budget from your point of view because you experienced a university life as well?
606500	612900	Getting the budget that they need to test and prove a lot of these theories in order
612940	618300	to explain more so we can understand more or is there a problem in that department?
618300	621980	No, there's this cool book, this really cool book, the same book that we were listening
621980	626380	to in the car, that towards the end of the book the guy kind of goes on this sort of
626380	630180	rant, which I don't like the end of the book because it's like some sort of he talks about
630180	635420	like we should give women more things and I don't think we should give women more.
635420	637220	I'm just misogynistic.
637220	644220	But then he's like he's talking about how the predominant like if you want to get a
644220	650340	faculty position at any sort of major university for the past 20 years it's basically all been
650340	651340	string theory.
651340	654580	You have to be a string theorist for some reason just and that a lot of that is because
654580	657460	there's already string theorists in power and they're the ones that get to choose whether
657460	658460	or not you.
658460	661380	There's a lot of politics about it.
661380	665900	And he's like advocating we need new ideas and we need to encourage new ideas.
665900	670020	So I would say that that would be like the things just encouraging ideas and it doesn't
670020	671020	have to do with the budget.
671020	677420	It's just like the the and when you say like you have to be a string theorist to be able
677420	680180	to get a good job.
680180	684140	Why would you think about any other thing outside of that box?
684140	685140	That's right.
685140	695600	So it's a sort of systematic change or to just be like to be yeah it's a it's some sort
695600	701240	of systematic change that needs to be done and I don't know how to do that but like or
701240	705560	just go against the system and just just study it on your own time or and don't get paid
705560	706560	for it.
706560	707560	Like yeah.
707560	711360	So if you want to get paid you should be a string theorist is basically the thing.
711360	715400	And my brother my brother he studied string theory so I don't really know anything about
715400	716400	string theory.
716400	717560	He studied it.
717560	722480	He did his PhD in it and and then he went and now he's doing mathematical finance because
722480	726760	he left it because he he didn't like string theory because it was too disconnected from
726760	727760	the real world.
727760	733440	Like it was too like there's so many assumptions that you're just making that just have to
733440	738520	be you're just assuming they're right because the equations kind of look elegant but they're
738520	739980	not really describing a world.
739980	743800	But then string theorists say well we're just not smart enough to sort of figure out the
743800	744800	equations yet.
744800	745800	They will describe our world eventually.
745800	751320	But that's such a big there's like a thousands of people have been working on it now for
751360	756280	like 30 years or 40 years and there's still no like big advancement.
756280	760720	But the equations are so elegant that they're like it must be right.
760720	762760	So he left it because of that.
762760	764320	And now he's starting to go back.
764320	769760	He just told me like just a couple of months ago and he said there's like been so little
769760	773960	advancement in the past 20 like 15 years since he left it.
773960	775060	So little change.
775060	781200	Like even though all these really bright people are working on it like there's no new ideas.
781200	782800	So what is the future of physics?
782800	784840	I don't know.
784840	787800	I'm going to be part of that though but that's secret stuff.
787800	788800	It's secret.
788800	789800	Yeah.
789800	790800	Secret stuff.
790800	794040	Well let's talk about women shouldn't have more things then.
794040	795040	Sure.
795040	798040	Let's talk about women.
798040	804800	Your movie Kurt just finished the movie shooting it and editing it.
804800	807480	And I think it's like 95 percent done overall.
807480	808480	Yeah.
808480	810600	And it will be screened on February 16.
811200	812200	That's right.
812200	813600	Where is it going to be screened?
813600	816400	At TIFF in the evening time.
816400	817400	So Tuesday night.
817400	819400	It's a lovely place.
819400	820720	It's a lovely movie.
820720	821720	It is a lovely movie.
821720	822720	Oh boy.
822720	824560	I can't watch my own movie.
824560	829200	So last the reason why I took a while to get back to you with notes on the stuff is.
829200	830200	Yes.
830200	836860	I'm doing I'm editing the dialogue for the film and he's talking about giving me notes
836860	839840	about the things that a director wants to change.
839840	844800	He directed the film written it and played in it.
844800	845800	Yeah.
845800	850560	And I guess I guess I guess doing a good job everybody.
850560	852560	And when.
852560	855960	So anyway I just like every time I have to watch my film to make notes because you have
855960	859520	to keep watching the revisions keep watching it being like oh the sound is too loud.
859520	865140	This not necessarily your stuff but just like object drops or whatever in the film or this
865140	866840	needs to be paced out differently.
866840	868800	Whatever I dread it so much.
868800	873560	Like I'll procrastinate like crazy like I feel so I feel so embarrassed.
873560	877360	I feel like like like my film sucks really really bad.
877360	883640	I know this this sucks for promotion because like but but just constantly understand the
883640	884640	feeling perfectly.
884640	885640	Yeah.
885640	890280	Like and there's so much dread and like I'd rather do anything else than watch it.
890280	893760	And to the point where I even went at the premiere I didn't even want to watch it like
893760	898040	because I was like it would just embarrass me.
898040	901800	I'm glad people like it because they don't they don't see it the way I'm seeing it like
901800	903640	they don't see the flaws.
903640	909600	But to me also just like I feel like it's just I don't know I keep I keep but you see
909600	914240	I think those are being considered flaws but you because you've already categorized them
914240	915400	as flaws.
915400	917160	A lot of people don't notice them.
917160	919560	A lot of people don't consider them as flaws.
919560	921600	So it just is.
921600	922600	Yeah.
922600	923600	Well yeah.
923600	927600	The reason I'm saying I understand what you're talking about is because I had the same experience
927600	935320	making my first album that my music album that I was playing like a guitar solo for
935320	940000	16 hours for like a week every day.
940000	941080	And I hated everything.
941080	942080	I hated myself.
942080	949520	I hated that music everything to perfect every single part of it and it will never be perfected.
949520	954880	And I'll just learn that you had to or I had to let go at some point and like you know
954880	956920	what this is this is cool.
956960	957960	This is awesome.
957960	964280	I'm going to let it go and then whatever did I learn from that experience I will apply
964280	970200	to my next experience and whatever I learn from that my next experience to the experience
970200	971200	after that.
971200	975480	And that's that's how it happened to me.
975480	977080	What sort of music?
977080	978980	What genre?
978980	979980	That album.
979980	980980	Yeah.
980980	984560	It was instrumental progressive rock jazz fusion.
984560	985560	What is that?
985560	986560	There's so many things.
986720	987720	Like technical things.
987720	988720	Technical.
988720	994200	Is there an example of something that like you're like it's like this that I could.
994200	996720	Do you know Dream Theater?
996720	997720	No.
997720	998720	Yeah.
998720	1000920	I know what those individual words mean.
1000920	1004960	I don't know.
1004960	1008960	I can't really think of what kind of music you listen to.
1008960	1011080	I just listen to I listen to Nirvana.
1011080	1012080	Yeah.
1012080	1013080	Nirvana.
1013080	1014080	Our Lady Pea is like the 90s rock.
1014080	1015080	Yeah.
1015120	1016120	Basically just those two.
1016120	1019520	And then I listen to like 1950s.
1019520	1026640	What kind of 1950s songs?
1026640	1027640	Easy Living.
1027640	1028640	Do you know Easy Living?
1028640	1029640	No.
1029640	1030640	Billie Holiday?
1030640	1031640	Yeah.
1031640	1032640	Okay.
1032640	1033640	So stuff like that.
1033640	1040440	Like I also like this song is like oh I'm the type of guy who never settles down for
1040440	1041440	pretty girls.
1041440	1042720	You know that song?
1042720	1043720	Is it Elvis Presley?
1044160	1045160	Oh it sounds like it.
1045160	1046160	I forget what his name is.
1046160	1047160	I'm a wanderer.
1047160	1048160	Yeah I'm a wanderer.
1048160	1051160	I roam around around.
1051160	1052160	Do you know this song?
1052160	1053160	No.
1053160	1055160	Okay.
1055160	1056160	So just I don't know.
1056160	1060640	I get it from Fallout because Fallout the video game is like all sort of 1950s songs
1060640	1061720	and I just liked it from that.
1061720	1062720	So I don't listen to it.
1062720	1063960	I actually don't listen to music.
1063960	1069280	This is something like most people don't realize or think is weird about me.
1069280	1071560	I never listen to music for enjoyment.
1071600	1075800	I just never, I don't have music downloaded on my computer.
1075800	1079080	My car speakers have never had music played out of them unless other people are hooking
1079080	1081720	up their phones to it or whatever.
1081720	1085920	I just, I don't listen to music for pleasure.
1085920	1093560	On the set of the film, whenever that we were not shooting, Kurt was singing Nirvana songs
1093560	1100320	with Kurt Cobain voice and some people liked it, some people didn't like it I guess.
1100360	1101360	Who didn't like it?
1101360	1102360	I don't know.
1102360	1107560	I heard a couple of times that you were asked to shut the fuck up.
1107560	1111240	I don't recall that at all.
1111240	1116520	I recall people being happy and delighted and asking for more.
1116520	1119520	What is about Nirvana?
1119520	1123240	Just the song structure or you can relate to the lyrics?
1123240	1124240	I don't know.
1124240	1126280	Not the lyrics.
1126280	1129680	I like, this is the same reason I like Our Lady Peace.
1129680	1130960	I like the melody.
1130960	1139560	I love sort of, I love melody in music a lot which is why I like, I actually kind of like
1139560	1144720	Lady Gaga's, this cool Lady Gaga song, Bad Romance and I like the part where he goes
1144720	1147480	da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
1147480	1148480	That's my favorite part of the song.
1148480	1152760	I really, really like that part but it's like weird to like a Lady Gaga song like if you're
1152760	1153760	just...
1153760	1154760	It's so weird.
1154760	1155760	I like Lady Gaga songs.
1155760	1156760	Yeah, it's not weird.
1156760	1157760	Thank you.
1158760	1165520	Yeah, so I just like melody so much and I think it's melody.
1165520	1166520	I think that's all it is.
1166520	1171560	Like the Nirvana songs are very melodic and then Our Lady Peace's songs are melodic and
1171560	1174360	I was listening and people are like, yeah, you should like Pearl Jam and stuff then if
1174360	1175360	you like Nirvana.
1175360	1178160	Pearl Jam stuff is not like melodic like Nirvana.
1178160	1185600	It's weird and then, and I don't like when people do like, I don't know, these weird
1185600	1191760	things with their, they go like, yeah, like stuff like that.
1191760	1194520	Like that's not melodic and then to me that's not melodic.
1194520	1198880	It's like more like sort of a vocal prowess, like showing your vocal prowess like Beyonce
1198880	1199880	would or something like that.
1199880	1200880	Right, show off.
1200880	1202080	Yeah, but that's fine.
1202080	1205760	Some people like that but I like the melody and that's not that melodic to me.
1205760	1211440	Like if he did that in a melodic way, I might like it but yeah and I think that's why I
1211440	1212440	like it.
1212480	1216080	Another thing that I, another great book that I've been reading recently is called You're
1216080	1217080	Not So Smart.
1217080	1218440	Have you heard of it?
1218440	1219440	You're Not So Smart, no.
1219440	1220720	It's a great, great book.
1220720	1222440	It's like, and each chapter is really short.
1222440	1229360	It has like 60 chapters and one of those chapters talks about you, it basically goes through
1229360	1234600	all sort of psychological biases you have as a human, psychological deficiencies, all
1234600	1235600	these things.
1235600	1238560	All these things, you think you're a rational person but here's why you're so irrational,
1238560	1241160	like more irrational than you think and then they were talking about-
1241160	1242160	Who's it by you now?
1242160	1243160	I don't know.
1243160	1248920	Then they were talking about what you think, they start off the chapter with like how you
1248920	1250600	think you are and this is how you are.
1250600	1254960	Like it's like you think you are, you have reasons for liking everything you do and you'll
1254960	1259680	even list reasons but the truth is you don't, those reasons are in your subconscious and
1259680	1262760	you don't have access to them and they are completely unrelated to what you think they
1262760	1263760	are.
1263760	1268520	So maybe these reasons I'm saying I like Nirvana are completely like BS, like I'm just making
1268520	1271040	them up but I don't know I'm making them up.
1271440	1275200	He's saying like giving examples like you think you like the song because you might
1275200	1278920	say well I like the drums and blah blah blah but it turns out you like it because when
1278920	1283520	you were a kid you watched this movie that had that and it was your favorite movie for
1283520	1288360	whatever other reason and the ending soundtrack sounds similar to that and so years later
1288360	1289360	you like that song.
1289360	1293440	I agree absolutely, yeah.
1293440	1298280	I think everything is like a domino, it's like one thing and this is like since the
1298320	1303560	beginning of everything, if it's Big Bang, yeah exactly.
1303560	1314560	So I actually don't think we have any free will in a sense that we can make a decision.
1314560	1319360	First of all I think all possibilities exist like whatever decision we want to make the
1319360	1325920	result of that is predetermined but we are just choosing like pathos.
1325920	1327200	What do you mean by that?
1327240	1335920	I mean I'm gonna go out of the house and then I get to a street that I can turn left or
1335920	1337160	right.
1337160	1344120	If I turn left series of things will happen like bird will fly over, wind will blow that
1344120	1346680	leaf, a car will pass by.
1346680	1349520	If I go right different things will happen.
1349520	1353160	What I'm saying is that left and right is already predetermined but I'm choosing if
1353160	1355680	I'm going left or right.
1355680	1357320	That's as much free will as I have.
1357320	1359000	Oh I see what you're saying.
1359000	1360000	That's my understanding.
1360000	1361000	What do you think?
1361000	1363440	I don't even believe that.
1363440	1365280	I believe in the gist of what you're saying.
1365280	1367920	So I do believe we don't have free will.
1367920	1372320	The universe is not deterministic, it can't be, which I can explain why, because of quantum
1372320	1374240	mechanics, just because of quantum mechanics, because of randomness.
1374240	1377640	So it's not determined but that doesn't have anything to do with free will.
1377640	1378640	Maybe it doesn't.
1378640	1381120	I'm not saying it's determined in a sense that...
1381120	1384440	Like from the single moment of Big Bang we can determine all future events.
1384440	1385440	Yes.
1386000	1389080	But all possibilities exist.
1389080	1390080	That's what I think.
1390080	1391080	What do you mean by that?
1391080	1397160	It means that everything that can happen, like alternate universes.
1397160	1401920	If I'm turning left here, one of me in one alternate universe will turn right.
1401920	1403640	You believe in the multiverse.
1403640	1406480	I don't know if multiverse will explain that.
1406480	1410040	Multiverse is the only thing that I can explain this what I think with now.
1410040	1411040	Okay.
1411040	1412040	Yeah.
1412040	1416280	I think everything exists and we are just taking different paths.
1416280	1421000	That path already exists but it's not predetermined that we're going to take that path.
1421000	1422000	Interesting.
1422000	1423000	Okay.
1423000	1426840	That decision that we're making at that point is a reaction to another action which by itself
1426840	1427840	is a reaction to another action.
1427840	1428840	Yeah.
1428840	1429840	I agree with that.
1429840	1434800	And I don't even think it's only about us and like me and you, we're talking and we
1434800	1438280	are affecting each other's train of thought.
1438280	1439280	Yeah.
1439640	1442480	We are also affected by the elements.
1442480	1444160	So everything is like this.
1444160	1449040	So we just have to write it and observe and understand things.
1449040	1454440	I think more and more to understand that everything is connected, we're just going with the flow
1454440	1456240	is like a drop in the ocean.
1456240	1457240	That's what I think.
1457240	1463560	You ever hear this thing about the only thing you can know for sure is that you're the only
1463560	1465320	thing that's conscious or whatever?
1465320	1466320	Right.
1466440	1471000	That to me, that is one of the dumbest things I've ever heard and they'll tell you why.
1471000	1472000	Yeah.
1472000	1480640	It's true but then why, if that was true and I was the only conscious thing or that person
1480640	1484960	who wrote it was the only conscious thing and she or he, I think it's a she just because
1484960	1487480	my hatred for this person.
1487480	1489960	So she wrote this thing.
1489960	1490960	Why would you even write it?
1490960	1495560	Why would you spend the tens and hundreds of hours to write this whole thesis statement
1495560	1502000	about why you are the only one that really exists or that you can know for sure exists?
1502000	1504440	If you really believe that, why bother?
1504440	1507360	Why not just not do anything or murder people?
1507360	1508360	Obviously it's not true.
1508360	1513120	If you ask anybody who knows that, they would say or they would just say they don't believe
1513120	1517320	that because otherwise you would live your life completely differently if you really
1517320	1518320	thought that was true.
1518320	1524200	I know theoretically or whatever if you're talking about like in terms of experience,
1524200	1527320	you can only talk about your own experience.
1527320	1528960	Like that's the only thing you could say is true.
1528960	1534000	Everybody else could be a robot but it's just one of the dumbest sort of arguments that
1534000	1536400	someone makes that's trying to sound intellectual.
1536400	1540080	Like I just hate that argument so much.
1540080	1543160	It's just if it was true, why would you do it?
1543160	1544160	Why would you even say it?
1544160	1546480	Like what's the point of even doing anything?
1546480	1550560	I don't know if there is any point overall.
1550560	1559560	The point is probably to not die of hunger and be somewhere warm, you know?
1559560	1568480	But then we have imagination and we have the tool to make it happen so we make things.
1568480	1574600	But what I'm saying is that we don't have any control over decisions individually because...
1574600	1580200	So let's say that thing was true, that thing that conscious being thing was true.
1580200	1583160	Like you only know that you're the only conscious being.
1583160	1586320	So then if it's true, then that means that I'm the only conscious being because right
1586320	1588360	now I'm the only one experiencing myself right now.
1588360	1591120	So I feel like I'm the only one that's living, really.
1591120	1598980	Well they really say in a conversation between two people, there are multiple of us exist.
1598980	1601080	One of me is who I think I am.
1601080	1603960	One of me is who you think I am.
1603960	1611840	Which is completely different from me, but that's how you categorize aga in your mind.
1611840	1614640	And one version is who I really am.
1614640	1618580	Who are you aga?
1618580	1620160	You tell me.
1620160	1625840	You just made this argument about how I can't, that there is an alternate aga.
1625840	1628800	I think there is alternate of everything.
1628800	1630000	Who you think you are.
1630000	1633480	Let's probe into this one particular alternate thing.
1633480	1635360	Who are you?
1635360	1638520	What's something about you that I don't know?
1638520	1644720	Nothing like trivial, like you like orange socks or something strange.
1644720	1651000	I don't give a fuck about overall.
1651000	1658040	I think it just, you make things and you make you enjoy the result for most people, but
1658040	1661280	the point is to be able to enjoy the process of making them.
1661320	1662720	Do you ever have regret?
1662720	1663720	Huh?
1663720	1665520	Do you ever have regret?
1665520	1667560	I don't believe in regret.
1667560	1669080	I don't think it's logical.
1669080	1674480	I know, but we're just, you know, irrational or logical beings, so I want to know if you
1674480	1675480	can...
1675480	1677240	Well, we don't have to.
1677240	1678880	We don't have to be irrational or logical.
1678880	1682820	Oh, but you're not so smart books, Differ is, begs to differ.
1682820	1685200	You should read that book, it's a great book by the way.
1685200	1689440	Anyway, so obviously like I don't believe in a, like there's lots of things you can
1689440	1690620	logically know.
1690620	1697380	I think regret comes from judging a event in the past with our present knowledge and
1697380	1700260	wisdom and in hindsight.
1700260	1705900	But I can also equally say that the opposite of regret, which is like, um, whatever acceptance
1705900	1712820	maybe, if regret is irrational, why is acceptance not irrational?
1712820	1714500	That is also irrational.
1714500	1716620	So what, what is the most, what do you do?
1716620	1717620	How do you, what do you do?
1717740	1721300	Do you just sit there in the state of like, of just like, just, you just...
1721300	1723300	No, because I have to survive.
1723300	1724660	That's the thing.
1724660	1725660	I have to survive.
1725660	1726660	I have to eat.
1726660	1728500	I have to drink water.
1728500	1739420	But my point is, it's very Buddhist, I guess, is like that I should be fine with being in
1739420	1747860	that room that you're saying completely empty or being in, in the middle of, you know, a
1747860	1748860	palace.
1748860	1755980	Like, I knew I'm limited to pretty much one room, doesn't matter where I live because
1755980	1756980	that's how I grew up.
1756980	1758980	What do you mean?
1758980	1759980	I was always in my room.
1759980	1762980	Oh, this was just a metaphoric, I was just joking.
1762980	1766260	I didn't literally mean, are you going to be in a room?
1766260	1769260	You could be.
1769500	1770500	And I could be.
1770500	1771780	So when you say like, you know...
1771780	1779380	But what I'm saying is that we are, we, there is nothing objective about what we're experiencing.
1779380	1781020	It's a complete subjective experience.
1781020	1784300	So the reality that you're experiencing is a very different reality than I'm experiencing
1784300	1785300	everybody else's.
1785300	1786300	Yeah.
1786300	1789980	No, but what I'm, I agree with that, but what I'm talking about is like, you said you don't
1789980	1798100	give a fuck, which I believe you, but I want to know, so you don't really, I want to know
1798100	1799100	if you experience regret.
1799100	1802700	I know you don't think it's rational, but that's a different thing entirely.
1802700	1804700	Whether or not you experience regret or whether or not you think...
1804700	1805700	Sometimes I do.
1805700	1806700	Yeah.
1806700	1811700	So you give, you basically, you do give a fuck, but just way less than most people.
1811700	1816300	I think it's just a matter of discipline and practice to get to a point that you can't
1816300	1820900	change your past and you're building your future right now.
1820900	1825840	So the best thing to do is to focus on right now, whatever it is that's happening.
1825840	1837360	So for me, I want to be the most observant and present in the moment that I can be to
1837360	1841000	experience that.
1841000	1846340	Does that, and does that bring you happiness?
1846340	1847340	What is happiness?
1847340	1849240	No, that's, that's why I'm asking you like...
1849240	1853600	Well, you should define happiness.
1853600	1856560	What do you define happiness as?
1856560	1864400	I define happiness as healthy, being healthy, being fulfilled and being successful.
1864400	1865400	Okay.
1865400	1866400	But...
1866400	1868600	Let's get rid of the successful part.
1868600	1869600	Let's say...
1869600	1872360	Successful, it doesn't necessarily relate to money.
1872360	1873360	No, I know.
1873360	1874360	Material success.
1874360	1875360	No, of course, of course.
1875360	1877080	But I, so let's say the fulfillment thing.
1877080	1878080	So do you feel...
1878080	1879080	All right, fine.
1879080	1880080	Put in successful.
1881080	1882080	Do you feel happy?
1882080	1884240	You're whatever your definition of happy is.
1884240	1885240	Fuck yeah.
1885240	1890880	I think I'm the fucking luckiest person that I know.
1890880	1892440	Good.
1892440	1893960	And I'm an atheist.
1893960	1898220	So I don't have God to thank to.
1898220	1904720	And I found out that saying thank you universe is also that fucking same bullshit.
1904720	1907020	Yeah, who says thank you universe?
1907020	1908440	Some people do.
1909000	1915840	They want to replace God with something else, but it's the same fucking nonsense.
1915840	1917840	So I'm just happy.
1917840	1923240	There's this girl on my Facebook feed that like, I just, I met her at Starbucks.
1923240	1928120	She, I don't know, she looked like a normal person.
1928120	1931120	And then, and then we just exchanged Facebook contact.
1931120	1935440	And I see her, the stuff that she posts on Facebook, it's all, she's always like, she
1935640	1939360	puts these vlogs that like three people see, but she talks like she's, she acts like she's
1939360	1942680	talking to like thousands or she has like a cult following.
1942680	1944880	She's like, she's like, Hey everybody.
1944880	1946240	Oh my God.
1946240	1947820	It's such a beautiful day.
1947820	1949520	Don't you just like shut your mouth.
1949520	1953520	And she, and she talks about like, like you should like go on a cleanse.
1953520	1956520	Like I just went on a, a yoga retreat.
1956520	1958800	Who goes fuck you on a fucking yoga retreat.
1958800	1960520	I hate her so much.
1960520	1965040	And I keep her as my friend because it aggravates me sometimes like, you know, some people,
1965040	1969080	they go to Reddit, like they browse R funny, R slash funny or whatever, to like make themselves
1969080	1970080	feel good.
1970080	1974280	Sometimes I'll, I'll browse things to make myself feel bad just cause I'm a weirdo.
1974280	1978200	And so, so whenever I want to feel like hatred, I'll just, I'll look at her Facebook feed.
1978200	1986600	It's like all about like, there's, there's toxins in like, like in like the, like the
1986600	1992740	government is, is a toxin, not, not that that's actually like another thing.
1992740	1996900	The government puts toxins in your, just like, oh, fucking bullshit.
1996900	1999880	Well, people are looking for a purpose now.
1999880	2001300	It's bullshit purpose.
2001300	2004100	Yeah, but she's, she just sucks as a person.
2004100	2005460	A lot of people did.
2005460	2008900	Yeah, but she in particular, she broadcasts it.
2008900	2013980	She broadcasts it with such confidence and such sincerity to convince herself that she's
2013980	2014980	a good person.
2014980	2016420	No, she, she's already done that.
2016420	2018680	She's done that a long time ago.
2019560	2025680	And she also has like really like, she's also not even that fit, but she keeps talking about
2025680	2027280	how she's so fit.
2027280	2028680	She needs to lose some weight.
2028680	2033660	She needs to like you, like she needs to, she's, she's not a good person.
2033660	2034660	She bothers me so much.
2034660	2038380	I wish I could say her name.
2038380	2044460	I once posted something, oh, oh, oh, she also, we just never, I just added her and then we
2044460	2045540	never talked, right?
2045540	2048460	So she doesn't even know who I am anymore because it's been so long, right?
2048460	2050860	Why did you add her as a first place?
2050860	2051860	This was like two years ago.
2051860	2052860	But why?
2052860	2053860	Why?
2053860	2054860	I don't know.
2054860	2055860	I was just adding everybody at that time.
2055860	2056860	No, I was not, not everybody.
2056860	2058820	I was just adding, cause she was a woman, she was a girl.
2058820	2060820	So I was like, okay, maybe I could sleep with her.
2060820	2061820	Yeah.
2061820	2062820	Did you?
2062820	2063820	No.
2063820	2067220	I'm at her vagina is probably like, probably like she probably doesn't, I don't know.
2067220	2068980	She probably does weird things to it with like.
2068980	2069980	Like what?
2069980	2076860	It's like one of those things that you take where you dilute it in water so many times.
2076860	2078020	What's that thing?
2078020	2079020	What's that thing called?
2079020	2083420	Where you dilute it in water and then homeopathic, she probably does homeopathic solutions for
2083420	2086900	her real yeast infection and it's just not going away.
2086900	2089900	She's like, no, it's working.
2089900	2091140	I can feel it.
2091140	2096780	Is this a, is this a hatred towards women or you're just very critical of them?
2096780	2100740	Cause it's kind of a pattern that can be also seen in your film.
2100740	2102540	Oh, seriously?
2102540	2103540	Yeah.
2103540	2109740	So, well, tell me this first, is your film, how would you categorize that?
2109740	2114060	Is comedy, philosophical, romantic?
2114060	2116020	Oh, very interesting.
2116020	2121260	So, so there's so much, something that's really, something that I wanted to do is like, whatever
2121860	2126860	I write, I write it for, I want it to be like the best thing that I could possibly write
2126860	2132180	at the time and I'm not going to dumb it down for anybody.
2132180	2139540	So there's a lot of stuff in there that's like sort of weird and esoteric and it's like,
2139540	2141460	also then, then I also, here's another thing.
2141460	2144900	Just like that girl where she has three followers, but she acts like she has a thousand, I'm
2144900	2147620	criticizing her, but I kind of do the same thing with my film.
2147620	2155540	Like I, I, I put so many things in there that you really have to be so observant to realize.
2155540	2159620	Like you have to watch the film three times to be like, oh, that sentence means this.
2159620	2162300	Oh, that implies there's another layer underneath.
2162300	2166780	And then, and then I put like, for those people that figure that out, for the hardcore fans,
2166780	2170620	like you can be like, oh, there's another layer underneath that.
2170620	2173440	And then, and then even one more that like no one will figure out until like ask them
2173440	2177500	one specific question, like, oh, well, why do you think this character did this?
2177500	2179620	And then they'd be like, holy shit.
2179620	2182100	And then they inspire you to start writing.
2182100	2187220	What did you get inspired to get into movies?
2187220	2197540	I used to do standup and it was just, I just wanted to do something like, you know, everybody
2197540	2198740	wants to do movies.
2198740	2203260	Everybody like, everybody says that, oh, I have a story or whatever they, so it's like
2203260	2206380	in our culture to just like want to do movies and I was already doing standup.
2206380	2209300	So then I was like, okay, I can write it.
2209300	2215300	Then I, the real story is like I made a script for Comedy Central when I just did one performance.
2215300	2220180	All I did was one performance on stage and I did pretty good.
2220180	2221580	And I just thought it was like the best.
2221580	2226980	So I wrote a script for Comedy Central after one performance on stage and it sucked so
2226980	2228460	bad and they rejected it.
2228460	2232980	And then I was just like, I just, instead of me being like, fuck, what the fuck, man,
2232980	2233980	I suck.
2234100	2237380	Instead of me being like that, which I normally would, I don't know why it wasn't, I was just
2237380	2240060	like, who are they to reject my amazing script?
2240060	2242700	I was like, such overconfidence about it.
2242700	2243700	And the script, by the way-
2243700	2244700	How long ago was that?
2244700	2247180	This was like when I was 18.
2247180	2249180	How old are you now?
2249180	2250180	27.
2250180	2252380	So nine years ago, yeah.
2252380	2256780	So then I just like learned, I was like, fine, I'll make my own script, learned to use a
2256780	2257780	camera.
2257780	2260340	Then I wanted to get a director and no one would direct it, like I didn't know how to
2260340	2261340	get a director.
2261340	2262340	I'm like, fine, I'll learn to direct.
2262340	2264460	I'll be my own director.
2264460	2265460	Wanted to get someone to edit.
2265460	2266460	I'm like, no one will.
2266460	2268340	Fine, I'll learn to edit it myself.
2268340	2271260	Then it just kind of went that way of like people saying no, then I was like, fine, I'll
2271260	2272460	do it anyway.
2272460	2278180	And then so it just kind of came about from doing a bunch of those little comedy things
2278180	2279180	or little-
2279180	2280180	It's awesome.
2280180	2281180	Videos, yeah.
2281180	2285300	Is this story based on something that happened to you personally?
2285300	2288380	All of it is like, almost all of it is real.
2288380	2291220	Yeah, very, very little of it is not real.
2291220	2295740	Like almost everything is a storyline that really happened, except obviously Japiness,
2295740	2301100	which is a story that there's no real, there's a story in the film, the character gets, wants
2301100	2304860	to make a story for Japanese people and then he's-
2304860	2307780	It's not racist, it's cultural awareness.
2307780	2308780	Yeah.
2308780	2310620	And then it's just-
2310620	2311620	It's pretty good.
2311620	2315740	Yeah, then that's fake, obviously.
2315740	2319340	You were influenced by Larry David, clearly.
2319340	2320340	Yeah.
2320340	2321700	Did he yell into you or no?
2321700	2325900	Not really, but someone said that, someone said Wes Anderson, which I really disagree
2325900	2326900	with.
2326900	2327900	I don't even like Wes Anderson.
2327900	2331500	I watched his films like once each, not even twice.
2331500	2332900	Which ones did you watch?
2332900	2339420	So I watched Bottle Rocket, which I think is the one that I like the most.
2339420	2342700	And I really, oh, I like Mr. The Fantastic Fox, something like that.
2342700	2345540	I really like that one.
2345540	2349340	And then the rest I don't really like, like Darjeeling Unlimited or whatever.
2349340	2350940	Oh no, I love that film.
2350940	2356340	Yeah, so I didn't really like it, but then what else?
2356340	2362340	His most recent ones I didn't like, the past three, Hotels, no the Hotel Chavalier was
2362340	2364060	a short film I think.
2364060	2366380	Yeah, that's a short film.
2366380	2371980	That one I really totally liked though, that one I liked, and that wasn't comedic at all.
2371980	2372980	Yeah.
2372980	2377380	Yeah, so it was strange that people said it was Wes Anderson, it's only because I love
2377380	2379300	like straight-ons of people.
2379300	2383620	I love straight-ons, and just for people who aren't into film, that just means you film
2383620	2387380	a character straight-on and not at an angle, like they're looking almost at the barrel
2387380	2388380	of the lens.
2388380	2389740	I love that.
2389740	2394900	And I guess Wes Anderson does that too, so that's pretty much the only, maybe Whip Pans.
2394900	2399260	Maybe that and Whip Pans is the, but for me, I wrote that in the script, like I wasn't
2399260	2406660	even thinking Wes Anderson, I just, that was just a better scene transition than a cut.
2406660	2409060	It just, it flowed better.
2409060	2414300	Like I could see it while I was writing it, that if it was a cut, it would be 5% different
2414300	2417180	in terms of the emotion that I wanted to evoke.
2417180	2418660	So I was like, okay, I can make it.
2418660	2421500	How do you define people, like actors especially?
2421500	2422500	Mandy.
2422500	2425300	Just Mandy, that's it.
2425300	2429380	A little bit through this website called My Goalio, which is this new website.
2429380	2435020	And then you went by faces for actors or did they audition for it and you were like, okay,
2435020	2437180	not you, not you, not you, you, yes.
2437180	2438180	Yeah.
2438180	2439180	It was like Tinder.
2439180	2443060	It was like swiping on Tinder, especially for the women, because there's, but not because
2443060	2445020	I'm just going for who looks good.
2445020	2449380	I'm just going for like who looks like the role that I, like you have to, first, the
2449380	2453100	first filter is you have to look like the person that I want you to look like.
2453100	2455660	And then the second thing is like, then you have to act it.
2455660	2461140	So I could eliminate a lot of the people just by like swiping left or archiving or whatever.
2461140	2462140	Yeah.
2462140	2465300	And same with the guys too.
2465300	2467580	How long was the process?
2467580	2472780	Pre-production started two weeks before production, like it was so hectic, man.
2472780	2476100	And we were doing pre-production while we're doing production too.
2476100	2484020	In fact, the guy who played the lead role, Hanny, the second lead, it was going to be
2484020	2486660	someone completely different than his schedule changed.
2486660	2488380	And he was the most ideal person.
2488380	2491980	And then he was quoting me some crazy amount of money that he wanted.
2491980	2495900	And then it was like just per day, even if it was one hour, but it was a crazy amount,
2495900	2500900	like more money than my cinematographer is being paid, more money than like even my cinematographer
2500900	2503820	and producer together are being paid.
2503820	2504820	And he's not even that good.
2504820	2506940	He's not like, I don't know why he wanted that.
2506940	2510340	I think he was doing that as a way to get out, but whatever.
2510340	2512620	So I couldn't get him.
2512620	2514460	And then he wouldn't even guarantee me dates.
2514460	2517180	So I'm like, I was thinking like, if I'm going to pay you that much, you better say that
2517180	2520980	you're free on the dates that I want you to be free if I'm telling you in advance.
2520980	2523260	And he's like, no, I can't do those dates.
2523260	2530460	But anyway, so then we got Hanny, the guy who played his name, Sean Ray, and this is
2530460	2531460	not good.
2531460	2537580	Sean Ray wouldn't want to hear this, but like he was like our, we were just like, I personally
2537580	2539540	was like, fuck it, fine.
2539540	2540540	We'll just get this guy.
2540540	2542540	Like seriously, I feel so bad.
2542540	2543740	He did a really good job though.
2543740	2548740	No, he did a great job, but like at the time when I watched his audition, I was watching
2548740	2549740	a bunch of auditions.
2550500	2555060	The whole theme of the script, the whole theme of the movie after a while became fuck it,
2555060	2556060	whatever.
2556060	2559940	Like for every little decision, like certain things would start to go wrong and or like
2559940	2564540	you just never ideal, then you just say fuck it, whatever, just move on.
2564540	2568660	Even to this, to the supporting lead, like we're watching the auditions, he, he sucked
2568660	2569660	the least.
2569660	2573340	I was like, ah, fuck it, we'll just cast him.
2573340	2574340	So we got him to come in.
2574340	2578360	I told him it was an audition and it was, but we set up lights and everything.
2578360	2582640	We set up the whole scene with the fog machine, with the labs, with everything so that we
2582640	2586960	could film it at the same time so that if it did work, we could put it in the film.
2586960	2590720	And then that scene ended up going in the film.
2590720	2594280	It was the one where he had to ADR because that was one with the dialogue that was the
2594280	2595280	worst.
2595280	2596280	Yeah.
2596280	2598760	But no, he ended up being really good.
2598760	2599960	I didn't want him to do the accent.
2599960	2603160	I first, I put that in the script and then I thought the accent was too silly and I didn't
2603160	2604640	want that in the movie.
2604640	2609040	But then Khan and Jess and the, and someone else that was there just said like, no, the
2609040	2610040	accent's good.
2610040	2611040	The accent's good.
2611040	2612040	I'm like, whatever.
2612040	2615240	We did multiple takes with the accent without, for that one scene.
2615240	2619080	And then I was like, okay, fine, we'll, we'll put the accent in and everybody loved him
2619080	2620080	a lot.
2620080	2621080	Yeah.
2621080	2622080	Like people were surprised he doesn't even have that accent.
2622080	2624680	No, he's doing a really good job.
2624680	2626680	Yeah, he's the, he's the best actor.
2626680	2628100	I'm the worst actor.
2628100	2630280	And then it goes, I have, I'm pretty bad.
2630280	2631600	I don't think you're too bad.
2631600	2632600	I'm like cracking.
2632600	2634200	I'm like laughing at certain scenes.
2634200	2636240	It was, it was, I was okay.
2636240	2637240	Fine.
2637240	2638240	I was okay.
2638240	2641240	I was better than the, I don't want to say the other people that weren't that good, but
2641240	2642240	yeah.
2642240	2643240	Do you have the second movie planned?
2643240	2644240	I do.
2644240	2645240	Yeah.
2645240	2646240	What's that?
2646240	2648760	So, so that one's going to be a big, big movie.
2648760	2650200	I can talk about that later.
2650200	2651200	I can't talk about things.
2651200	2652200	It's not that planned.
2652200	2658840	That's why it's very in its infancy, but it's going to be, it's going to be like, I keep
2659320	2665880	But it's going to be considered to be one of the greatest movies ever made.
2665880	2667200	And people are like, oh yeah, sure.
2667200	2668200	Well, that's good.
2668200	2669200	You're shamed for that.
2669200	2671760	That's like how people think it, but I'm, I'm serious.
2671760	2674360	Like it's going to be that good.
2674360	2680080	Like we know how there's the standard top 100, which is like Citizen Kane, Godfather,
2680080	2683400	I don't know, Shawshank maybe.
2683400	2684400	It's going to be up there.
2684400	2688080	It's like, it will almost, it's going to be good.
2688120	2689600	My next one's going to be amazing.
2689600	2693080	Then my third one, I have that one kind of planned.
2693080	2696520	That one is not going to be in terms of, it's going to be good.
2696520	2697520	It's going to be great.
2697520	2700880	To me, it'll be even better than my second, but it won't be considered by critics and
2700880	2705800	stuff to be like the top 100, but that one will change people's lives.
2705800	2711040	Like my third one is like one that will like make you be like, oh, like rethink a lot of
2711040	2712040	stuff.
2712040	2715640	That one's, my third one's a very thought provoking one.
2715640	2716640	Interesting.
2716640	2717640	Yeah.
2718320	2721440	Have you started a process of writing a script for both of them at the same time?
2721440	2722440	No.
2722440	2725600	I just have the idea for the third one and I kind of have the idea for the second one
2725600	2727120	that I'm writing still.
2727120	2728120	Yeah.
2728120	2734840	You mentioned that you have a special kind of passion for Toronto and you want to do
2734840	2741160	with Toronto what Woody Allen did with New York.
2741160	2745880	What makes you so interested in Toronto and are your future movies also going to be in
2745880	2748480	Toronto and all your movies are going to be in Toronto?
2748480	2752240	At least the next two, right, because I haven't planned and I have something interesting planned
2752240	2754360	for how I'm going to do my second one about Toronto.
2754360	2759000	It's going to almost be like, not CG, but like it's going to be a changed, it's a Toronto
2759000	2765080	you haven't seen, like a very tweaked Toronto, kind of like her, like slightly futuristic,
2765080	2769600	but it's not really, it's not a future in this movie.
2769600	2774360	It's not like a science fiction, so her is like kind of fantasy in the future.
2774360	2781240	This is not that, but anyway, yeah, it's going to be in Toronto and the reason why, I don't
2781240	2783800	know, I have an irrational love for Toronto.
2783800	2788960	It's irrational, just like you're not so smart tells me in the book, but really I have no
2788960	2792640	reason to love the city that much other than it's the first world country, which is great
2792640	2798560	and like I always, I constantly tell people, people ask me like, what's something you do
2798560	2799560	for fun?
2799600	2806320	And something I love to do is like just walk around downtown at night with just the streetlights
2806320	2807320	and just everything.
2807320	2813000	Like I feel, there's like this childlike sort of like, I feel so happy, so like content
2813000	2817920	and happy and like, and grateful, I'm like, look at all these things we have that everybody's
2817920	2822160	just walking past and they don't even care about, but like we have like paved, first
2822160	2825800	of all, we have paved roads and not just like any paved, they're great, they're like normal
2825920	2832560	roads, they're not like Trinidad roads in my country.
2832560	2836440	So they're great, we have clean water, anytime we want, we can just get clean water.
2836440	2838360	We don't even have to, we can go to a store and it's...
2838360	2842320	Clean water apparently is not the case across Canada, but it is in Toronto definitely.
2842320	2844320	Sure, okay, so let's say Toronto, yeah.
2844320	2846440	So that's what I'm saying, like how good we have it here.
2846440	2847440	So clean water.
2847440	2849560	Oh, this is like heaven.
2849560	2851200	It's amazing, like the worst...
2851200	2853080	Not like heaven, this is heaven.
2853160	2858960	Like a homeless person here has it better than like the average Nigerian or whatever,
2858960	2859960	so choose something.
2859960	2862880	Yeah, like 90% population of the world probably.
2862880	2868640	Yeah, so it's really cool and people are so, they don't really appreciate it.
2868640	2873400	It's not that people don't appreciate it, people want more and I think that's what,
2873400	2877000	it's one of those things of being a human.
2877000	2880960	This is something that bothers me about that whole 1%, 99% thing, I really hate that whole
2880960	2882680	movement.
2882680	2884160	I hate anybody that...
2884160	2886520	I don't like that movement either.
2886520	2890160	Anybody that talks about inequality, I could not care, I could not care less about inequality,
2890160	2893680	I couldn't, because here's my argument for any, about the whole thing.
2893680	2898920	So if you are part of the 99% and you're just middle class or like, let's say even lower
2898920	2900400	middle class, okay?
2900400	2904240	Of course poverty line like, even the poverty line is like okay compared to other countries,
2904240	2906440	but let's just talk about lower middle class, okay?
2906440	2908440	You're talking about here.
2908440	2912240	Yeah, so here in the States, here and the States, okay?
2913200	2918880	You have it, you are living like royalty lived like a thousand years ago, not royalty but
2918880	2921680	like the rich lived a thousand years ago, way better than them.
2921680	2926440	You have cell phones, you have like right angles on streets and like all these, you
2926440	2928160	have cars and do you know what I mean?
2928160	2933000	Like you have it better, why do you care if someone else has it even better than you if
2933000	2934000	you have it good?
2934000	2937680	You should never look at someone else's plate and be like, why do they have more food?
2937680	2940120	You should look at your own plate and do I have enough and maybe look at someone else
2940120	2941720	and be like, do they have enough?
2941720	2944800	But don't look at someone else and be like, I should be having that, that sort of feeling
2944800	2950760	of being jealous and being like, oh it's unfair, it's unfair that they have more.
2950760	2952680	Who cares as long as you're satisfied.
2952680	2955120	That's exactly how they feel though.
2955120	2960280	I know but that's, to me that's, it's like, it doesn't, it's so irrational like you're,
2960280	2961280	you have every...
2961280	2964080	It's not irrational for them, it's irrational.
2964080	2966480	No, it's real to them but it's still irrational.
2966480	2974560	For you and for me and for people who have certain kind of comfort, that's the thing.
2974560	2978800	That's what I mean by not all of us experiencing the same reality.
2978800	2985360	Here's the thing, here's the thing, if I told you, if I just, people's concept of what happy
2985360	2989200	is is like so fucked up, that's why I have something against happiness but I can go on
2989200	2993840	for like hours about that but like, so people say, if I ask you, let's take someone who's
2993840	2994840	happy okay?
2995800	2996800	So are you happy?
2996800	2997800	And they say yes.
2997800	3000040	I'm like okay, can you list out all the reasons why you're happy?
3000040	3005440	And then they're like, okay, I can go to a restaurant whenever I want, I can blah blah
3005440	3008640	blah, I have kids that love me blah blah, okay?
3008640	3014360	Then I say, okay by the way, that's great, now did you know that there are aliens that
3014360	3017800	live and they live in like, you didn't know this but they live like right on the outer
3017800	3023800	atmosphere of earth and they live in this great like hunger games, like palace of like
3023800	3029120	royalty and it turns out that you can actually fly as a human but they've limited you and
3029120	3030120	you can't fly.
3030120	3031120	Are you happy?
3031120	3033800	Most people would be like no, what the fuck, that's fucked up.
3033800	3038080	But what on that list that you just wrote down that made you happy has changed?
3038080	3041880	That list is exactly the same, you should still be happy but now you feel like oh I'm
3041880	3044840	missing out on something and then that makes you unhappy?
3044840	3045840	Your list has not changed.
3045840	3047560	Yeah, they want to be special.
3048360	3049520	That bothers me so much.
3049520	3051840	So your happiness is relative to other people's?
3051840	3053720	Yeah, for them.
3053720	3055280	I'm not saying it's right, I think it's-
3055280	3056280	I know, that's just-
3056280	3060560	But that's not going to change, it's just a matter of evolution, I think chimps are like
3060560	3061560	that.
3061560	3064760	Exactly, exactly, there's the whole thing about the chimp and the grapes.
3064760	3068920	I've always thought if we want to understand people really well, we have to start watching
3068920	3074440	a lot of documentaries about chimps because that explains a lot, the jealousy, greed-
3074440	3079520	Right, no, they have evolutionary roots but that doesn't mean that they're okay.
3079520	3084600	Just like, I'm not looking at someone being unjust and then looking at a chimp yelling
3084600	3087600	about not getting enough grapes and being like, oh yeah, well that chimp really had
3087600	3092840	a point, that chimp is really smart and really deduced based on logic and reason behind that.
3092840	3098040	For the chimp's logic and reason, that's the thing, how are we going to compare a human
3098040	3100680	logic and reason with chimp's logic and reason?
3100680	3102400	But that's what they're doing.
3102480	3106720	I have the same feeling about religion and extremely religious people, that they just
3106720	3113200	buy into that fact because that gives them a sense of purpose and that's a problem I
3113200	3114200	think.
3114200	3118920	When you say it's rational to them, what do you mean?
3118920	3121520	Because okay, I can see how they can think it's rational.
3121520	3127800	What I mean is that I'm going to quote David Lynch, a great director and philosopher I
3127800	3134080	would say, that if you have a golf ball size consciousness, your understanding of the world
3134080	3136840	is a golf ball size.
3136840	3141200	If you have a box, that's the amount of your understanding of the world.
3141200	3145520	If it's infinite, okay, okay, fine.
3145520	3150960	So what I would say, what they are experiencing, you know, that triangle of our crucial needs
3150960	3154120	and stuff, it starts with, yeah.
3154120	3162560	So they have less amount of security and comfort and ease of mind than you, me and privileged
3162560	3163560	people.
3163560	3167360	It's not that we're privileged, but we're pretty comfortable.
3167360	3171880	Yeah, okay, I know what you're going to say, sorry to cut you off, but what I would say
3171880	3176960	to that is like, there's a difference between something being rational to them and it being
3176960	3178200	rational.
3178200	3179960	So objectively rational.
3179960	3182400	I don't think there is such a thing as objective rationality.
3182400	3186160	Oh, well, we can talk about that another time.
3186160	3187160	Yeah.
3187160	3197840	I think we, there are certain laws like gravity and yeah, but nothing like related, even,
3197840	3201000	you know, related to morality at all.
3201000	3205520	What about Sam Harris's whole moral landscape?
3205520	3206520	I love that book.
3206520	3208680	And do you not agree with it?
3208680	3209680	I don't know.
3209680	3217640	I think he changed also a lot of, not a lot, but some way of thinking about his too.
3217640	3219560	After that book came out, you mean?
3219560	3225340	There is a bit, I see the difference between moral landscape and wake up, right, or waking
3225340	3226340	up.
3226340	3227340	Yeah.
3227340	3228340	I don't know.
3228340	3229340	Which one did you like more?
3229340	3230340	Can I guess?
3230340	3231340	Yeah.
3231340	3235800	I think you like waking up more.
3235800	3236800	I think so too.
3236800	3237800	Yeah.
3238720	3241960	So I really liked the moral landscape a lot and I just didn't like waking up.
3241960	3242960	Yeah.
3242960	3243960	Yeah.
3243960	3249840	I listened to it and I was like, no, well, I mean, he just talks about spirituality,
3249840	3252480	but there's nothing there that was like a new idea to me.
3252480	3253680	It was more like just talking about spirituality.
3253680	3260440	I basically like him coming to that place that he considers that, which I think is pretty
3260440	3261440	cool.
3261440	3264840	And just so your listeners aren't confused, when Sam Harris talks about spirituality,
3264840	3267240	it's not like regular people talking about spirituality.
3267240	3271280	He just, he's using that as a word because he has no other word to do.
3271280	3274920	He's a neuroscientist philosopher who...
3274920	3275920	Atheist too.
3275920	3276920	Atheist.
3276920	3279040	One of the greatest atheists.
3279040	3281680	So let me ask you two final questions.
3281680	3286400	The first one would be, what is the purpose of life?
3286400	3287400	There is no purpose.
3287400	3290760	A purpose kind of to me implies some sort of higher being.
3290760	3294960	That's another reason why I have something against the word deserved.
3294960	3299320	When anybody says, oh, you deserve this, there's something that irks me inside.
3299320	3300320	And women say that a lot.
3300320	3302880	This is all ties back to...
3302880	3305840	We didn't get to talk deeply about your hatred for women.
3305840	3308080	No, but women say this thing all the time.
3308080	3310240	They're like, girl, you deserve that break.
3310240	3311240	You deserve...
3311240	3313720	Girls use the word deserve like far too much.
3313720	3315000	Explain to me one sentence.
3315000	3317360	What is the core difference between men and women?
3317360	3318800	Oh, there's so many.
3319640	3326760	So I'll tell you, a man's sort of power and status in his life comes from him struggling
3326760	3328240	hard to make it.
3328240	3331280	Okay, unless you're just really good looking, which there are very few guys that are good
3331280	3337440	looking and just make it off their good looks, versus a girl who can just be...
3337440	3340960	When I say girls, I'm talking about like, let's say you're seven and a half and above,
3340960	3343560	because then if you're six and below, you're just...
3343560	3347720	If you're five and below, you're like, I'm sorry, you might as well be a man.
3347720	3351400	So I'm talking about like a certain status of women, okay?
3351400	3358560	So if you're a woman, then you just like, guys would just like, take your luggage for
3358560	3360160	you, just do everything for you.
3360160	3361160	I remember I was...
3361160	3365720	There's a story about this guy who did stand up for like 30 years, was doing great.
3365720	3369200	Finally like, he went off stage, like everyone's applauding and like turning heads and stuff.
3369200	3371200	I'm like, he's like, yeah, I feel good.
3371200	3375600	Then some hot girl came in like two minutes later and all the heads turned to look at
3375600	3379880	her in the same way that he got looked at because he was a celebrity.
3379880	3383080	That's just quintessentially, that's what you have to do as a man.
3383080	3387920	Those 30 years of experience to just kind of equal what a girl gets automatically.
3387920	3392760	Yeah, but you should look at countries like Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan and those places
3392760	3399320	that they keep their women in the closet and in the beekeeping suit and they can't even
3399320	3401320	drive.
3401320	3407880	So who gives a fuck if somebody can't get drinks or applause because they have big boobs?
3407880	3414720	People are attracted to big boobs and they are to male physics, majority of people.
3414720	3424440	I think we should all sort of aspire to be like Saudi Arabia and I'm just kidding.
3424440	3428880	So I'm only talking about the Western world, of course.
3429000	3430000	I don't care about the...
3430000	3433240	I mean, I do care but I'm not ranting about...
3433240	3439000	I'm not like gonna go tell a woman who's getting acid in her face like, yo, well, you had it
3439000	3441320	good your whole life so now you get acid.
3441320	3443000	I'm not gonna tell that, you know.
3443000	3445040	So I'm talking about like...
3445040	3448560	And then there's so much more awareness of women's issues than there are men but yet
3448560	3451880	the society thinks it's totally the opposite.
3451880	3458520	The way society thinks like, if you grew up in the 80s, if you were born in the 80s and
3458520	3461880	above, you're just feminized.
3461880	3464640	It's all liberal arts, like every...
3464640	3471200	Even the word rape was only very recently made to incorporate a man.
3471200	3474240	People think that women were more oppressed than they were.
3474240	3476160	People think that women make $0.75...
3476160	3478320	Oh, it's much better than it used to be.
3478320	3480560	No, but also people think that...
3481040	3485920	There are still a lot of problems like pay is a big deal, you know, call paying.
3485920	3488160	No, but that's been shown to be false.
3488160	3493600	Like, so another thing I used to study was economics like a little bit and there's so
3493600	3498920	many economics, economic like just things about money that people are wrong about.
3498920	3501920	So the whole $0.75 a dollar thing is shown to be false.
3501920	3507920	If you make everything equal, like you try to control for, does this girl have the same
3507960	3508960	education as the guy?
3508960	3512080	Has she stayed in the company the same as the guy, the same position?
3512080	3513840	Then they get paid the same.
3513840	3515160	It turns out they get paid the same.
3515160	3523040	The difference is like if you add up, like in total, how much money do women make?
3523040	3524040	How much money do men make?
3524040	3528120	It's about 75% of what men make, something like that, okay?
3528120	3531600	And then that comes in because women make different choices, they go into different
3531600	3532600	fields.
3532600	3536320	Men tend to go into engineering or whatever, women tend to go into whatever, other things
3536320	3537320	that pay like...
3537480	3542720	So you're saying the women who go to engineering do not have equal pay to men who are engineers?
3542720	3545920	Oh, well then you have to also account for did they have kids?
3545920	3547360	Did they take time off of work?
3547360	3550660	So if you account for all these things and did a man take time off of work, blah, blah,
3550660	3553520	if you account for those things and you hold them, that's what you have to do in science
3553520	3557880	before you make a correlation between variables, you have to fix every other thing to say that
3557880	3562880	these things are the causation, there's a cause and effect.
3562880	3565200	Then it turns out that the pays are equal.
3565200	3567120	And so I could just send you so many videos on that.
3567120	3570680	There's search pay wage gap myth or something like that.
3570680	3572080	There's tons of videos about that.
3572080	3573800	Yeah, it's a myth.
3573800	3577720	Are you following US politics, US election campaigns?
3577720	3585040	No, no, I don't know who Bernie Sanders is and I don't know, I want...
3585040	3588680	I would love it if Trump got elected.
3588680	3590800	I kind of like what he says.
3590800	3595400	A lot of people say like, yeah, Trump sucks, like, oh, why?
3595400	3598080	He's just a negative man.
3598080	3601240	That's not even like an argument against like, what particular policy...
3601240	3605760	Well, you know, actually, we were talking on the first episode of this podcast how I'm
3605760	3610400	going to support Donald Trump if Bernie Sanders don't get the Democratic candidacy because
3610400	3613060	Hillary Clinton is the other person.
3613060	3619160	But she brought Sarah Palin to the game and that's where he lost me because that is just...
3619160	3620160	Trump brought Palin?
3620160	3621160	Yeah.
3621160	3622160	It's just...
3622160	3623160	Marketing.
3623400	3628600	It is, but I mean, to what kind of people is just bringing shit show, you know?
3628600	3631600	Anyways, let me ask you the final question.
3631600	3638320	If you come across an intelligent alien from a different civilization, what would you tell
3638320	3644320	that intelligent alien as the worst things that humanity has done and what would you
3644320	3647160	tell that alien as the best thing that we have achieved?
3647160	3650160	Oh, that's a very good question.
3650160	3661160	Um, the worst thing is like, just torture, just people being tortured.
3661160	3670160	Like how, just, you know, like, obviously people will say, yeah, the US torture is going
3670160	3671160	to be...
3671160	3672160	Well, okay, fine, whatever.
3672160	3673160	It's in the US too.
3673160	3678560	But also Japan and like World War II, like some of this stuff they did is crazy and no
3678560	3681560	one hears about it because it's just not taught, they talk more about Germany.
3681560	3688560	So like it's like, I used to just, like I said, how sometimes I want to get mad at things.
3688560	3690720	Like I want to get mad at that girl on my Facebook.
3690720	3694760	Sometimes I want to know, I want to know the real, how the world really is.
3694760	3697800	Even if it makes me like feel sad and depressed.
3697800	3700720	So sometimes I'd like purposely go out of the way to search for depressing facts just
3700720	3705720	because I feel like to get a sort of broad-eyed, bird's-eye view of everything.
3705720	3707680	Some of the things Japan did was fucked up.
3707680	3712360	So just suffering and torture is the worst.
3712360	3714000	I don't particularly care about slavery.
3714000	3719480	I mean, no, don't misconstruing me anybody in the future.
3719480	3724960	What I mean is like, to me, slavery compared to suffering, compared to torturing, sorry,
3724960	3725960	is not that bad.
3725960	3728920	Unless you torture your slaves.
3728920	3730920	There's nothing that compares to torture.
3730920	3733840	So torture is the worst that humanity does.
3733840	3737440	Even to animals, I really hate that.
3738000	3753480	The best thing is, I don't know, the internet, the internet, something like that.
3753480	3757240	Yeah, it's probably something like that.
3757240	3765280	Or whatever is the start of a technological revolution that would eventually make the
3765280	3766280	internet anyway.
3766280	3769520	And the internet's going to make something else and make those other things and singularity,
3769520	3770520	blah, blah, blah.
3770520	3773240	So whatever started that, that was the best thing.
3773240	3776320	Because without it, we wouldn't be on that thing to the singularity.
3776320	3778720	And I think the singularity is going to be the best thing.
3778720	3784520	But whatever starts it is obviously also good because it started us into an almost inevitable
3784520	3786400	push to the singularity.
3786400	3793680	Like Ray Kurzweil shows, even past World War I and World War II, that law of accelerated
3793680	3797600	returns doesn't even perturb, despite World Wars.
3797600	3799080	It's almost like inevitable.
3799080	3800200	So yeah.
