1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
People's concept of what's hap- what happy is is like so fucked up.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,920
That's why I have something against happiness.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello, and welcome to the third episode of Neo Human Podcast.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,160
I'm Agabahari.

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,200
You can follow me on Twitter and Instagram at Agologist.

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,800
And you can follow the show on Live in Limbo at liveinlimbo.com.

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:43,120
So for the third episode, I'm here with Kurt Jaimungal, who is a physics and math grad

8
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,240
from University of Toronto, and he is a filmmaker now.

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,320
So when did you graduate from a physics and math program?

10
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,480
Like I spent way too long in undergrad.

11
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,680
Why did you choose that field?

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,800
I love- I still love physics and math.

13
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:09,960
When I was a kid, my dad would make me learn math and chess and stuff at like a really

14
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,960
young age.

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,760
He would like pressure me and I hated that.

16
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,400
And I didn't like him at a young age because of that because it was like a lot of pressure.

17
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,400
Even I remember I wanted to watch The Simpsons one time.

18
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,840
And so I was playing- he would make me play blindfolded chess with my sister.

19
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,840
So I would be blindfolded.

20
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,680
My sister is allowed to be not blindfolded because she wasn't as good as me.

21
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,240
So I would be blindfolded.

22
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,280
And then I was just making mistakes on purpose because I knew the new Simpsons episode was

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,440
coming on and my dad saw this and he physically cut the cable.

24
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,280
And then I went upstairs crying.

25
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,280
I went upstairs crying and my mom woke up and then she's like, Paul.

26
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,600
My dad's like, Paul, what are you doing to the child?

27
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,280
She's like, he's like, Christ, that's my mom's name.

28
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,280
Just yelling at each other.

29
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,800
And then I'm crying in my room and I don't have TV.

30
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,800
I can't do anything.

31
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,800
I just have to sit in the dark.

32
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,600
Yeah, so I was just kind of pressured from a young age to do like analytical things.

33
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,440
Was your dad a- or is your dad an academic?

34
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,440
Oh, well he's a teacher, but of woodworking.

35
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,120
Although he studied chemistry in university.

36
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,320
He just wanted his kids- like, you know, when I was- even my brother- my brother went through

37
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,800
worse than what I did.

38
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,280
So you had two brothers, one sister?

39
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
One brother, two sisters.

40
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,520
It's like two boys, two girls.

41
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,520
Oh, okay.

42
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
Yeah.

43
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,720
And like when I was a kid, it's that classic thing of like the parents say, like, you'll

44
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,720
thank me later.

45
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,600
And I really- I wish that he was harder on me because it really helped me out throughout

46
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
the rest of my life.

47
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Oh, yeah?

48
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,200
Because, you know, I was learning- I was learning calculus in grade three.

49
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,840
Like actual calculus and integral calculus, not just regular calculus.

50
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,560
So when you talk about your childhood, would you categorize it as a good or bad childhood?

51
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,560
Good.

52
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,000
I'd say it's pretty good.

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'd say it's pretty good.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,440
Aside from that stuff, I had a pretty good childhood.

55
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,120
Which was bad because it didn't prepare me for like the crappy adulthood.

56
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,120
Was it in Canada?

57
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
Yeah.

58
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,120
Yeah.

59
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,120
Everything's in Canada.

60
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,120
Yeah.

61
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,120
In Toronto.

62
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,120
Yeah, in Toronto.

63
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,120
That's awesome.

64
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,120
Born and raised.

65
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,120
Basically born and raised.

66
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,800
But I mean, I came here when I was like two months old or three months old.

67
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
Yeah.

68
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Yeah.

69
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,320
And then I always liked math and physics.

70
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,400
I always liked math in particular.

71
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
And then physics.

72
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,760
I forgot how physics came about.

73
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,360
I think my brother was explaining something to me about quantum fluctuations one time.

74
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,600
This was when Blockbuster was still around.

75
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:46,080
And then I remember finding that fascinating that particles can come in and out of existence.

76
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,240
Like just like that.

77
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,440
Because all I knew was that you cannot create or destroy anything.

78
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,960
And then he's telling me, no, you can.

79
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,080
It's just in very small time scales you can.

80
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,400
And it happens all the time.

81
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
Happening in front of us right now.

82
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,000
It happens in between atoms.

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,320
Like anytime there's empty space, that's happening.

84
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,320
And that fascinated me.

85
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,240
I think I just from there, I always looked up like physics.

86
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,840
Yeah, so I always loved physics.

87
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:19,280
When you say coming in and going out of existence, in existence it's very tangible.

88
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,600
It's understandable.

89
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,240
What is out of existence from the point of view of a person who is passionate about physics

90
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,720
and has studied physics?

91
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,520
Let's say you have empty spaces.

92
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,520
There's nothing in it.

93
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,520
Right.

94
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,840
This is a vacuum is what they call it.

95
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,680
And then so you're looking at this vacuum and there's nothing.

96
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,240
But then what happens is out of this nothing, you'll see an electron and then an anti-electron

97
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,800
appear and then collide.

98
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,560
An anti-electron, whenever antimatter collides with regular matter, matter will destroy itself.

99
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,040
Usually it destroys itself in energy.

100
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,920
So a photon will be emitted.

101
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:08,000
But in these little anti-particle pairs, they'll come in and out of existence like this constantly.

102
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,680
I'm making a gesture with my hands that no one can see.

103
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:19,440
Yeah, so there's nothing, they come and then they go like, yeah.

104
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,280
Where are they coming from?

105
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:31,040
It doesn't mean that they're coming from somewhere, it's just that it's like the laws say that,

106
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,120
okay, you've heard of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, right?

107
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,440
Yes, but say it anyways.

108
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:41,740
This basically comes from Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which says you can't simultaneously

109
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:53,840
measure a particle's position with 100% accuracy and know its momentum with any accuracy.

110
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,660
There's a trade-off between knowing how sure are you of its position and how sure are you

111
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,880
of its momentum.

112
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,720
If you try and measure one with a certain degree of accuracy, it will limit the other's

113
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,080
accuracy.

114
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:11,760
So people normally kind of say it like, imagine you're playing like billiard balls, I mean,

115
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:17,640
you're playing pool, and let's say it's dark, okay, so you can't see the balls but you can

116
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,200
only shoot another ball at the ball that you're trying to measure.

117
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,000
You're trying to figure out where is this white ball, let's say, okay?

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,200
So the only way you can know is if you interact with it by throwing other balls.

119
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,120
So usually that's photons, we're looking at something, we're interacting with it by looking

120
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,120
at it, right?

121
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,800
Photons are being emitted to it.

122
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,120
So let's say we're trying to find out where this white ball is.

123
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,480
We don't know, the white ball could be moving, it could have momentum, momentum just like

124
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,820
velocity and speed, okay?

125
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,880
It could be moving or it could be still and we don't know where on the board it is, so

126
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,880
we're just shooting.

127
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,200
Let's say we shoot it with the ball.

128
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,280
This is such a bad analogy.

129
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:07,000
So basically, the harder you hit the white ball, let's say I use my billiard ball to

130
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,640
hit the white ball really hard, okay, and the white ball goes flying off somewhere but

131
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,000
my ball stays right where the white ball was, okay, like I just hit it and then my ball

132
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,840
stays and the white ball goes there, then I'll know like, oh, I have a pretty good idea

133
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,080
of where the position was of that white ball but now I don't know its momentum anymore

134
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,760
because I just changed it.

135
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:35,720
Whereas before, I could kind of like go very softly to it and let's say the white ball

136
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:41,120
is moving and I go very softly with my billiard ball to hit it, my billiard ball will move

137
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,600
a little bit and I won't really know its position but that's such a bad analogy.

138
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,960
But anyway, it's like basically, there's a trade-off.

139
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,200
But then here's the thing that most people don't know is that the trade-off doesn't happen

140
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,040
because we suck at observing or there's some human thing.

141
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,640
The trade-off is even the atom itself doesn't know its own momentum and position accurately.

142
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
That's what's the interesting thing.

143
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:11,400
Is this the same thing with when it's being observed, it behaves as a particle and when

144
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,480
it's not observed, it behaves as waves?

145
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,200
No, it behaves as both even when you observe it and when you don't observe it.

146
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,960
What they're saying is it lives in a superposition of like up and down, left and right, all these

147
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,720
things simultaneously until you observe it, then it chooses one.

148
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,720
Right.

149
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:35,800
That's just an interpretation of quantum mechanics that like that...

150
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,560
The equations kind of imply that but it's just an implication, right?

151
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,200
Like there's many different other implications, different interpretations of what the equations

152
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
mean.

153
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,400
All we know is these equations are the most accurate equations in all of science.

154
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:59,360
They're the most tested of any sort of scientific field even more than cellular biology or whatever.

155
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,320
These equations are correct down to the degree of accuracy of like, let's say you're trying

156
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:11,480
to measure the earth and your measurement is within a marble, like within a penny's

157
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,360
sort of length of like the radius of the earth.

158
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,780
That's your error.

159
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,980
That's also how accurate we can measure certain things quantum mechanically.

160
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,660
Like of course we just go down to the scale of that.

161
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,900
How long has it been since we developed this?

162
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,700
That's 100 years now.

163
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,700
100 years.

164
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:34,740
Basically, what I'm understanding from this conversation so far is that physics has attempted

165
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:43,460
to explain the world and life and the universe and has succeeded in your opinion and maybe

166
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:48,260
my opinion and in the opinion of a lot of people has succeeded greatly but there is

167
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,460
a huge amount that we still don't know about.

168
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:54,740
There are things that we don't know that we don't know.

169
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:01,660
Is physics in general and physics departments around Canada and United States getting the

170
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,500
budget from your point of view because you experienced a university life as well?

171
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:12,900
Getting the budget that they need to test and prove a lot of these theories in order

172
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:18,300
to explain more so we can understand more or is there a problem in that department?

173
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,980
No, there's this cool book, this really cool book, the same book that we were listening

174
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,380
to in the car, that towards the end of the book the guy kind of goes on this sort of

175
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,180
rant, which I don't like the end of the book because it's like some sort of he talks about

176
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:35,420
like we should give women more things and I don't think we should give women more.

177
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,220
I'm just misogynistic.

178
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:44,220
But then he's like he's talking about how the predominant like if you want to get a

179
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:50,340
faculty position at any sort of major university for the past 20 years it's basically all been

180
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,340
string theory.

181
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,580
You have to be a string theorist for some reason just and that a lot of that is because

182
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,460
there's already string theorists in power and they're the ones that get to choose whether

183
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,460
or not you.

184
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:01,380
There's a lot of politics about it.

185
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,900
And he's like advocating we need new ideas and we need to encourage new ideas.

186
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,020
So I would say that that would be like the things just encouraging ideas and it doesn't

187
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,020
have to do with the budget.

188
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:17,420
It's just like the the and when you say like you have to be a string theorist to be able

189
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,180
to get a good job.

190
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,140
Why would you think about any other thing outside of that box?

191
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,140
That's right.

192
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:35,600
So it's a sort of systematic change or to just be like to be yeah it's a it's some sort

193
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,240
of systematic change that needs to be done and I don't know how to do that but like or

194
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,560
just go against the system and just just study it on your own time or and don't get paid

195
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,560
for it.

196
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,560
Like yeah.

197
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,360
So if you want to get paid you should be a string theorist is basically the thing.

198
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,400
And my brother my brother he studied string theory so I don't really know anything about

199
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
string theory.

200
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,560
He studied it.

201
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,480
He did his PhD in it and and then he went and now he's doing mathematical finance because

202
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,760
he left it because he he didn't like string theory because it was too disconnected from

203
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,760
the real world.

204
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,440
Like it was too like there's so many assumptions that you're just making that just have to

205
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,520
be you're just assuming they're right because the equations kind of look elegant but they're

206
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,980
not really describing a world.

207
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,800
But then string theorists say well we're just not smart enough to sort of figure out the

208
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
equations yet.

209
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
They will describe our world eventually.

210
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:31,320
But that's such a big there's like a thousands of people have been working on it now for

211
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,280
like 30 years or 40 years and there's still no like big advancement.

212
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,720
But the equations are so elegant that they're like it must be right.

213
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,760
So he left it because of that.

214
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,320
And now he's starting to go back.

215
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,760
He just told me like just a couple of months ago and he said there's like been so little

216
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,960
advancement in the past 20 like 15 years since he left it.

217
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,060
So little change.

218
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:01,200
Like even though all these really bright people are working on it like there's no new ideas.

219
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,800
So what is the future of physics?

220
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,840
I don't know.

221
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,800
I'm going to be part of that though but that's secret stuff.

222
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
It's secret.

223
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,800
Yeah.

224
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
Secret stuff.

225
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,040
Well let's talk about women shouldn't have more things then.

226
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,040
Sure.

227
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,040
Let's talk about women.

228
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:24,800
Your movie Kurt just finished the movie shooting it and editing it.

229
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,480
And I think it's like 95 percent done overall.

230
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,480
Yeah.

231
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,600
And it will be screened on February 16.

232
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
That's right.

233
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,600
Where is it going to be screened?

234
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,400
At TIFF in the evening time.

235
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,400
So Tuesday night.

236
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,400
It's a lovely place.

237
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,720
It's a lovely movie.

238
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,720
It is a lovely movie.

239
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,720
Oh boy.

240
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,560
I can't watch my own movie.

241
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,200
So last the reason why I took a while to get back to you with notes on the stuff is.

242
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,200
Yes.

243
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:56,860
I'm doing I'm editing the dialogue for the film and he's talking about giving me notes

244
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,840
about the things that a director wants to change.

245
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,800
He directed the film written it and played in it.

246
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,800
Yeah.

247
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,560
And I guess I guess I guess doing a good job everybody.

248
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,560
And when.

249
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,960
So anyway I just like every time I have to watch my film to make notes because you have

250
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,520
to keep watching the revisions keep watching it being like oh the sound is too loud.

251
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:25,140
This not necessarily your stuff but just like object drops or whatever in the film or this

252
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,840
needs to be paced out differently.

253
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,800
Whatever I dread it so much.

254
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,560
Like I'll procrastinate like crazy like I feel so I feel so embarrassed.

255
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,360
I feel like like like my film sucks really really bad.

256
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,640
I know this this sucks for promotion because like but but just constantly understand the

257
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,640
feeling perfectly.

258
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,640
Yeah.

259
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,280
Like and there's so much dread and like I'd rather do anything else than watch it.

260
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,760
And to the point where I even went at the premiere I didn't even want to watch it like

261
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,040
because I was like it would just embarrass me.

262
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,800
I'm glad people like it because they don't they don't see it the way I'm seeing it like

263
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,640
they don't see the flaws.

264
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:09,600
But to me also just like I feel like it's just I don't know I keep I keep but you see

265
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,240
I think those are being considered flaws but you because you've already categorized them

266
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,400
as flaws.

267
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,160
A lot of people don't notice them.

268
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,560
A lot of people don't consider them as flaws.

269
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,600
So it just is.

270
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,600
Yeah.

271
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,600
Well yeah.

272
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,600
The reason I'm saying I understand what you're talking about is because I had the same experience

273
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:35,320
making my first album that my music album that I was playing like a guitar solo for

274
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:40,000
16 hours for like a week every day.

275
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,080
And I hated everything.

276
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,080
I hated myself.

277
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:49,520
I hated that music everything to perfect every single part of it and it will never be perfected.

278
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,880
And I'll just learn that you had to or I had to let go at some point and like you know

279
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,920
what this is this is cool.

280
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,960
This is awesome.

281
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:04,280
I'm going to let it go and then whatever did I learn from that experience I will apply

282
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:10,200
to my next experience and whatever I learn from that my next experience to the experience

283
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,200
after that.

284
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,480
And that's that's how it happened to me.

285
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,080
What sort of music?

286
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,980
What genre?

287
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,980
That album.

288
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,980
Yeah.

289
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,560
It was instrumental progressive rock jazz fusion.

290
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,560
What is that?

291
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,560
There's so many things.

292
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,720
Like technical things.

293
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,720
Technical.

294
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,200
Is there an example of something that like you're like it's like this that I could.

295
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,720
Do you know Dream Theater?

296
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,720
No.

297
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
Yeah.

298
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,920
I know what those individual words mean.

299
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,960
I don't know.

300
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,960
I can't really think of what kind of music you listen to.

301
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,080
I just listen to I listen to Nirvana.

302
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,080
Yeah.

303
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,080
Nirvana.

304
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,080
Our Lady Pea is like the 90s rock.

305
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,080
Yeah.

306
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,120
Basically just those two.

307
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,520
And then I listen to like 1950s.

308
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:06,640
What kind of 1950s songs?

309
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,640
Easy Living.

310
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,640
Do you know Easy Living?

311
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,640
No.

312
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,640
Billie Holiday?

313
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,640
Yeah.

314
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,640
Okay.

315
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,640
So stuff like that.

316
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:20,440
Like I also like this song is like oh I'm the type of guy who never settles down for

317
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,440
pretty girls.

318
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,720
You know that song?

319
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,720
Is it Elvis Presley?

320
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,160
Oh it sounds like it.

321
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,160
I forget what his name is.

322
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
I'm a wanderer.

323
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
Yeah I'm a wanderer.

324
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,160
I roam around around.

325
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,160
Do you know this song?

326
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,160
No.

327
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,160
Okay.

328
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,160
So just I don't know.

329
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,640
I get it from Fallout because Fallout the video game is like all sort of 1950s songs

330
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,720
and I just liked it from that.

331
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,720
So I don't listen to it.

332
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,960
I actually don't listen to music.

333
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:49,280
This is something like most people don't realize or think is weird about me.

334
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,560
I never listen to music for enjoyment.

335
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,800
I just never, I don't have music downloaded on my computer.

336
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,080
My car speakers have never had music played out of them unless other people are hooking

337
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,720
up their phones to it or whatever.

338
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,920
I just, I don't listen to music for pleasure.

339
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:13,560
On the set of the film, whenever that we were not shooting, Kurt was singing Nirvana songs

340
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:20,320
with Kurt Cobain voice and some people liked it, some people didn't like it I guess.

341
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
Who didn't like it?

342
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,360
I don't know.

343
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,560
I heard a couple of times that you were asked to shut the fuck up.

344
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,240
I don't recall that at all.

345
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:36,520
I recall people being happy and delighted and asking for more.

346
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,520
What is about Nirvana?

347
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,240
Just the song structure or you can relate to the lyrics?

348
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,240
I don't know.

349
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,280
Not the lyrics.

350
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,680
I like, this is the same reason I like Our Lady Peace.

351
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,960
I like the melody.

352
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:59,560
I love sort of, I love melody in music a lot which is why I like, I actually kind of like

353
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:04,720
Lady Gaga's, this cool Lady Gaga song, Bad Romance and I like the part where he goes

354
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,480
da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

355
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,480
That's my favorite part of the song.

356
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,760
I really, really like that part but it's like weird to like a Lady Gaga song like if you're

357
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,760
just...

358
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,760
It's so weird.

359
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,760
I like Lady Gaga songs.

360
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,760
Yeah, it's not weird.

361
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,760
Thank you.

362
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:25,520
Yeah, so I just like melody so much and I think it's melody.

363
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,520
I think that's all it is.

364
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:31,560
Like the Nirvana songs are very melodic and then Our Lady Peace's songs are melodic and

365
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,360
I was listening and people are like, yeah, you should like Pearl Jam and stuff then if

366
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,360
you like Nirvana.

367
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,160
Pearl Jam stuff is not like melodic like Nirvana.

368
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:45,600
It's weird and then, and I don't like when people do like, I don't know, these weird

369
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:51,760
things with their, they go like, yeah, like stuff like that.

370
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,520
Like that's not melodic and then to me that's not melodic.

371
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,880
It's like more like sort of a vocal prowess, like showing your vocal prowess like Beyonce

372
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,880
would or something like that.

373
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,880
Right, show off.

374
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,080
Yeah, but that's fine.

375
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,760
Some people like that but I like the melody and that's not that melodic to me.

376
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,440
Like if he did that in a melodic way, I might like it but yeah and I think that's why I

377
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,440
like it.

378
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,080
Another thing that I, another great book that I've been reading recently is called You're

379
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,080
Not So Smart.

380
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,440
Have you heard of it?

381
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,440
You're Not So Smart, no.

382
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,720
It's a great, great book.

383
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,440
It's like, and each chapter is really short.

384
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:29,360
It has like 60 chapters and one of those chapters talks about you, it basically goes through

385
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,600
all sort of psychological biases you have as a human, psychological deficiencies, all

386
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,600
these things.

387
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,560
All these things, you think you're a rational person but here's why you're so irrational,

388
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,160
like more irrational than you think and then they were talking about-

389
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,160
Who's it by you now?

390
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
I don't know.

391
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:48,920
Then they were talking about what you think, they start off the chapter with like how you

392
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,600
think you are and this is how you are.

393
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,960
Like it's like you think you are, you have reasons for liking everything you do and you'll

394
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,680
even list reasons but the truth is you don't, those reasons are in your subconscious and

395
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,760
you don't have access to them and they are completely unrelated to what you think they

396
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,760
are.

397
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,520
So maybe these reasons I'm saying I like Nirvana are completely like BS, like I'm just making

398
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,040
them up but I don't know I'm making them up.

399
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,200
He's saying like giving examples like you think you like the song because you might

400
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,920
say well I like the drums and blah blah blah but it turns out you like it because when

401
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,520
you were a kid you watched this movie that had that and it was your favorite movie for

402
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:28,360
whatever other reason and the ending soundtrack sounds similar to that and so years later

403
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,360
you like that song.

404
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,440
I agree absolutely, yeah.

405
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,280
I think everything is like a domino, it's like one thing and this is like since the

406
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,560
beginning of everything, if it's Big Bang, yeah exactly.

407
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:54,560
So I actually don't think we have any free will in a sense that we can make a decision.

408
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:59,360
First of all I think all possibilities exist like whatever decision we want to make the

409
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,920
result of that is predetermined but we are just choosing like pathos.

410
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,200
What do you mean by that?

411
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:15,920
I mean I'm gonna go out of the house and then I get to a street that I can turn left or

412
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,160
right.

413
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:24,120
If I turn left series of things will happen like bird will fly over, wind will blow that

414
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,680
leaf, a car will pass by.

415
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,520
If I go right different things will happen.

416
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,160
What I'm saying is that left and right is already predetermined but I'm choosing if

417
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,680
I'm going left or right.

418
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,320
That's as much free will as I have.

419
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,000
Oh I see what you're saying.

420
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
That's my understanding.

421
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
What do you think?

422
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,440
I don't even believe that.

423
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,280
I believe in the gist of what you're saying.

424
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,920
So I do believe we don't have free will.

425
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:52,320
The universe is not deterministic, it can't be, which I can explain why, because of quantum

426
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,240
mechanics, just because of quantum mechanics, because of randomness.

427
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,640
So it's not determined but that doesn't have anything to do with free will.

428
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,640
Maybe it doesn't.

429
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,120
I'm not saying it's determined in a sense that...

430
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,440
Like from the single moment of Big Bang we can determine all future events.

431
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,440
Yes.

432
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,080
But all possibilities exist.

433
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,080
That's what I think.

434
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,080
What do you mean by that?

435
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:17,160
It means that everything that can happen, like alternate universes.

436
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,920
If I'm turning left here, one of me in one alternate universe will turn right.

437
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,640
You believe in the multiverse.

438
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,480
I don't know if multiverse will explain that.

439
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,040
Multiverse is the only thing that I can explain this what I think with now.

440
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,040
Okay.

441
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,040
Yeah.

442
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:36,280
I think everything exists and we are just taking different paths.

443
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:41,000
That path already exists but it's not predetermined that we're going to take that path.

444
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Interesting.

445
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Okay.

446
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,840
That decision that we're making at that point is a reaction to another action which by itself

447
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,840
is a reaction to another action.

448
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,840
Yeah.

449
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,840
I agree with that.

450
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,800
And I don't even think it's only about us and like me and you, we're talking and we

451
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,280
are affecting each other's train of thought.

452
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,280
Yeah.

453
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,480
We are also affected by the elements.

454
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,160
So everything is like this.

455
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:09,040
So we just have to write it and observe and understand things.

456
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:14,440
I think more and more to understand that everything is connected, we're just going with the flow

457
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,240
is like a drop in the ocean.

458
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,240
That's what I think.

459
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:23,560
You ever hear this thing about the only thing you can know for sure is that you're the only

460
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,320
thing that's conscious or whatever?

461
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,320
Right.

462
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:31,000
That to me, that is one of the dumbest things I've ever heard and they'll tell you why.

463
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Yeah.

464
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:40,640
It's true but then why, if that was true and I was the only conscious thing or that person

465
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,960
who wrote it was the only conscious thing and she or he, I think it's a she just because

466
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,480
my hatred for this person.

467
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,960
So she wrote this thing.

468
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,960
Why would you even write it?

469
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,560
Why would you spend the tens and hundreds of hours to write this whole thesis statement

470
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:02,000
about why you are the only one that really exists or that you can know for sure exists?

471
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,440
If you really believe that, why bother?

472
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,360
Why not just not do anything or murder people?

473
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,360
Obviously it's not true.

474
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:13,120
If you ask anybody who knows that, they would say or they would just say they don't believe

475
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,320
that because otherwise you would live your life completely differently if you really

476
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,320
thought that was true.

477
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:24,200
I know theoretically or whatever if you're talking about like in terms of experience,

478
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,320
you can only talk about your own experience.

479
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,960
Like that's the only thing you could say is true.

480
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,000
Everybody else could be a robot but it's just one of the dumbest sort of arguments that

481
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,400
someone makes that's trying to sound intellectual.

482
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,080
Like I just hate that argument so much.

483
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,160
It's just if it was true, why would you do it?

484
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,160
Why would you even say it?

485
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,480
Like what's the point of even doing anything?

486
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,560
I don't know if there is any point overall.

487
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:59,560
The point is probably to not die of hunger and be somewhere warm, you know?

488
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:08,480
But then we have imagination and we have the tool to make it happen so we make things.

489
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:14,600
But what I'm saying is that we don't have any control over decisions individually because...

490
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:20,200
So let's say that thing was true, that thing that conscious being thing was true.

491
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,160
Like you only know that you're the only conscious being.

492
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,320
So then if it's true, then that means that I'm the only conscious being because right

493
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,360
now I'm the only one experiencing myself right now.

494
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,120
So I feel like I'm the only one that's living, really.

495
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:38,980
Well they really say in a conversation between two people, there are multiple of us exist.

496
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,080
One of me is who I think I am.

497
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,960
One of me is who you think I am.

498
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:51,840
Which is completely different from me, but that's how you categorize aga in your mind.

499
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,640
And one version is who I really am.

500
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,580
Who are you aga?

501
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,160
You tell me.

502
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:05,840
You just made this argument about how I can't, that there is an alternate aga.

503
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,800
I think there is alternate of everything.

504
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,000
Who you think you are.

505
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,480
Let's probe into this one particular alternate thing.

506
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,360
Who are you?

507
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,520
What's something about you that I don't know?

508
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:24,720
Nothing like trivial, like you like orange socks or something strange.

509
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:31,000
I don't give a fuck about overall.

510
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:38,040
I think it just, you make things and you make you enjoy the result for most people, but

511
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,280
the point is to be able to enjoy the process of making them.

512
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,720
Do you ever have regret?

513
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,720
Huh?

514
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,520
Do you ever have regret?

515
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,560
I don't believe in regret.

516
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,080
I don't think it's logical.

517
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:54,480
I know, but we're just, you know, irrational or logical beings, so I want to know if you

518
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,480
can...

519
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,240
Well, we don't have to.

520
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,880
We don't have to be irrational or logical.

521
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,820
Oh, but you're not so smart books, Differ is, begs to differ.

522
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,200
You should read that book, it's a great book by the way.

523
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,440
Anyway, so obviously like I don't believe in a, like there's lots of things you can

524
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,620
logically know.

525
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:17,380
I think regret comes from judging a event in the past with our present knowledge and

526
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,260
wisdom and in hindsight.

527
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:25,900
But I can also equally say that the opposite of regret, which is like, um, whatever acceptance

528
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:32,820
maybe, if regret is irrational, why is acceptance not irrational?

529
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,500
That is also irrational.

530
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,620
So what, what is the most, what do you do?

531
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,620
How do you, what do you do?

532
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,300
Do you just sit there in the state of like, of just like, just, you just...

533
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,300
No, because I have to survive.

534
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,660
That's the thing.

535
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,660
I have to survive.

536
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,660
I have to eat.

537
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,500
I have to drink water.

538
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:59,420
But my point is, it's very Buddhist, I guess, is like that I should be fine with being in

539
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:07,860
that room that you're saying completely empty or being in, in the middle of, you know, a

540
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,860
palace.

541
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:15,980
Like, I knew I'm limited to pretty much one room, doesn't matter where I live because

542
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,980
that's how I grew up.

543
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,980
What do you mean?

544
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,980
I was always in my room.

545
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,980
Oh, this was just a metaphoric, I was just joking.

546
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,260
I didn't literally mean, are you going to be in a room?

547
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:29,260
You could be.

548
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,500
And I could be.

549
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,780
So when you say like, you know...

550
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:39,380
But what I'm saying is that we are, we, there is nothing objective about what we're experiencing.

551
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,020
It's a complete subjective experience.

552
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,300
So the reality that you're experiencing is a very different reality than I'm experiencing

553
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,300
everybody else's.

554
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,300
Yeah.

555
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,980
No, but what I'm, I agree with that, but what I'm talking about is like, you said you don't

556
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:58,100
give a fuck, which I believe you, but I want to know, so you don't really, I want to know

557
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,100
if you experience regret.

558
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,700
I know you don't think it's rational, but that's a different thing entirely.

559
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,700
Whether or not you experience regret or whether or not you think...

560
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,700
Sometimes I do.

561
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,700
Yeah.

562
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:11,700
So you give, you basically, you do give a fuck, but just way less than most people.

563
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,300
I think it's just a matter of discipline and practice to get to a point that you can't

564
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:20,900
change your past and you're building your future right now.

565
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:25,840
So the best thing to do is to focus on right now, whatever it is that's happening.

566
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:37,360
So for me, I want to be the most observant and present in the moment that I can be to

567
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,000
experience that.

568
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,340
Does that, and does that bring you happiness?

569
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,340
What is happiness?

570
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,240
No, that's, that's why I'm asking you like...

571
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:53,600
Well, you should define happiness.

572
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,560
What do you define happiness as?

573
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:04,400
I define happiness as healthy, being healthy, being fulfilled and being successful.

574
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
Okay.

575
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,400
But...

576
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,600
Let's get rid of the successful part.

577
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,600
Let's say...

578
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,360
Successful, it doesn't necessarily relate to money.

579
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,360
No, I know.

580
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,360
Material success.

581
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,360
No, of course, of course.

582
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,080
But I, so let's say the fulfillment thing.

583
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,080
So do you feel...

584
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,080
All right, fine.

585
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,080
Put in successful.

586
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,080
Do you feel happy?

587
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,240
You're whatever your definition of happy is.

588
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,240
Fuck yeah.

589
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:30,880
I think I'm the fucking luckiest person that I know.

590
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,440
Good.

591
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,960
And I'm an atheist.

592
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,220
So I don't have God to thank to.

593
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:44,720
And I found out that saying thank you universe is also that fucking same bullshit.

594
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,020
Yeah, who says thank you universe?

595
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,440
Some people do.

596
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,840
They want to replace God with something else, but it's the same fucking nonsense.

597
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,840
So I'm just happy.

598
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:03,240
There's this girl on my Facebook feed that like, I just, I met her at Starbucks.

599
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:08,120
She, I don't know, she looked like a normal person.

600
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,120
And then, and then we just exchanged Facebook contact.

601
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,440
And I see her, the stuff that she posts on Facebook, it's all, she's always like, she

602
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,360
puts these vlogs that like three people see, but she talks like she's, she acts like she's

603
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,680
talking to like thousands or she has like a cult following.

604
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,880
She's like, she's like, Hey everybody.

605
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,240
Oh my God.

606
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,820
It's such a beautiful day.

607
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,520
Don't you just like shut your mouth.

608
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,520
And she, and she talks about like, like you should like go on a cleanse.

609
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,520
Like I just went on a, a yoga retreat.

610
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,800
Who goes fuck you on a fucking yoga retreat.

611
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,520
I hate her so much.

612
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,040
And I keep her as my friend because it aggravates me sometimes like, you know, some people,

613
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:49,080
they go to Reddit, like they browse R funny, R slash funny or whatever, to like make themselves

614
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,080
feel good.

615
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,280
Sometimes I'll, I'll browse things to make myself feel bad just cause I'm a weirdo.

616
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,200
And so, so whenever I want to feel like hatred, I'll just, I'll look at her Facebook feed.

617
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:06,600
It's like all about like, there's, there's toxins in like, like in like the, like the

618
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:12,740
government is, is a toxin, not, not that that's actually like another thing.

619
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,900
The government puts toxins in your, just like, oh, fucking bullshit.

620
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,880
Well, people are looking for a purpose now.

621
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,300
It's bullshit purpose.

622
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,100
Yeah, but she's, she just sucks as a person.

623
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,460
A lot of people did.

624
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,900
Yeah, but she in particular, she broadcasts it.

625
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:33,980
She broadcasts it with such confidence and such sincerity to convince herself that she's

626
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,980
a good person.

627
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,420
No, she, she's already done that.

628
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,680
She's done that a long time ago.

629
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:45,680
And she also has like really like, she's also not even that fit, but she keeps talking about

630
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,280
how she's so fit.

631
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,680
She needs to lose some weight.

632
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:53,660
She needs to like you, like she needs to, she's, she's not a good person.

633
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,660
She bothers me so much.

634
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:58,380
I wish I could say her name.

635
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:04,460
I once posted something, oh, oh, oh, she also, we just never, I just added her and then we

636
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,540
never talked, right?

637
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,460
So she doesn't even know who I am anymore because it's been so long, right?

638
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,860
Why did you add her as a first place?

639
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,860
This was like two years ago.

640
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,860
But why?

641
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,860
Why?

642
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,860
I don't know.

643
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,860
I was just adding everybody at that time.

644
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,860
No, I was not, not everybody.

645
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,820
I was just adding, cause she was a woman, she was a girl.

646
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,820
So I was like, okay, maybe I could sleep with her.

647
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,820
Yeah.

648
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,820
Did you?

649
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,820
No.

650
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,220
I'm at her vagina is probably like, probably like she probably doesn't, I don't know.

651
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,980
She probably does weird things to it with like.

652
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,980
Like what?

653
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:36,860
It's like one of those things that you take where you dilute it in water so many times.

654
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,020
What's that thing?

655
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,020
What's that thing called?

656
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:43,420
Where you dilute it in water and then homeopathic, she probably does homeopathic solutions for

657
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,900
her real yeast infection and it's just not going away.

658
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,900
She's like, no, it's working.

659
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,140
I can feel it.

660
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:56,780
Is this a, is this a hatred towards women or you're just very critical of them?

661
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:00,740
Cause it's kind of a pattern that can be also seen in your film.

662
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,540
Oh, seriously?

663
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,540
Yeah.

664
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:09,740
So, well, tell me this first, is your film, how would you categorize that?

665
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:14,060
Is comedy, philosophical, romantic?

666
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,020
Oh, very interesting.

667
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:21,260
So, so there's so much, something that's really, something that I wanted to do is like, whatever

668
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:26,860
I write, I write it for, I want it to be like the best thing that I could possibly write

669
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:32,180
at the time and I'm not going to dumb it down for anybody.

670
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:39,540
So there's a lot of stuff in there that's like sort of weird and esoteric and it's like,

671
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,460
also then, then I also, here's another thing.

672
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,900
Just like that girl where she has three followers, but she acts like she has a thousand, I'm

673
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,620
criticizing her, but I kind of do the same thing with my film.

674
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:55,540
Like I, I, I put so many things in there that you really have to be so observant to realize.

675
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:59,620
Like you have to watch the film three times to be like, oh, that sentence means this.

676
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,300
Oh, that implies there's another layer underneath.

677
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:06,780
And then, and then I put like, for those people that figure that out, for the hardcore fans,

678
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,620
like you can be like, oh, there's another layer underneath that.

679
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:13,440
And then, and then even one more that like no one will figure out until like ask them

680
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,500
one specific question, like, oh, well, why do you think this character did this?

681
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,620
And then they'd be like, holy shit.

682
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,100
And then they inspire you to start writing.

683
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:27,220
What did you get inspired to get into movies?

684
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:37,540
I used to do standup and it was just, I just wanted to do something like, you know, everybody

685
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,740
wants to do movies.

686
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:43,260
Everybody like, everybody says that, oh, I have a story or whatever they, so it's like

687
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,380
in our culture to just like want to do movies and I was already doing standup.

688
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,300
So then I was like, okay, I can write it.

689
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:55,300
Then I, the real story is like I made a script for Comedy Central when I just did one performance.

690
00:36:55,300 --> 00:37:00,180
All I did was one performance on stage and I did pretty good.

691
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,580
And I just thought it was like the best.

692
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:06,980
So I wrote a script for Comedy Central after one performance on stage and it sucked so

693
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,460
bad and they rejected it.

694
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:12,980
And then I was just like, I just, instead of me being like, fuck, what the fuck, man,

695
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,980
I suck.

696
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,380
Instead of me being like that, which I normally would, I don't know why it wasn't, I was just

697
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,060
like, who are they to reject my amazing script?

698
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:22,700
I was like, such overconfidence about it.

699
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,700
And the script, by the way-

700
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,700
How long ago was that?

701
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,180
This was like when I was 18.

702
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,180
How old are you now?

703
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,180
27.

704
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,380
So nine years ago, yeah.

705
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:36,780
So then I just like learned, I was like, fine, I'll make my own script, learned to use a

706
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,780
camera.

707
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:40,340
Then I wanted to get a director and no one would direct it, like I didn't know how to

708
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,340
get a director.

709
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,340
I'm like, fine, I'll learn to direct.

710
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,460
I'll be my own director.

711
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,460
Wanted to get someone to edit.

712
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,460
I'm like, no one will.

713
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,340
Fine, I'll learn to edit it myself.

714
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:51,260
Then it just kind of went that way of like people saying no, then I was like, fine, I'll

715
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,460
do it anyway.

716
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:58,180
And then so it just kind of came about from doing a bunch of those little comedy things

717
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,180
or little-

718
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,180
It's awesome.

719
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,180
Videos, yeah.

720
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:05,300
Is this story based on something that happened to you personally?

721
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,380
All of it is like, almost all of it is real.

722
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,220
Yeah, very, very little of it is not real.

723
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:15,740
Like almost everything is a storyline that really happened, except obviously Japiness,

724
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:21,100
which is a story that there's no real, there's a story in the film, the character gets, wants

725
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,860
to make a story for Japanese people and then he's-

726
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,780
It's not racist, it's cultural awareness.

727
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,780
Yeah.

728
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,620
And then it's just-

729
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,620
It's pretty good.

730
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:35,740
Yeah, then that's fake, obviously.

731
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:39,340
You were influenced by Larry David, clearly.

732
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,340
Yeah.

733
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,700
Did he yell into you or no?

734
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:45,900
Not really, but someone said that, someone said Wes Anderson, which I really disagree

735
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,900
with.

736
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,900
I don't even like Wes Anderson.

737
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,500
I watched his films like once each, not even twice.

738
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,900
Which ones did you watch?

739
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:59,420
So I watched Bottle Rocket, which I think is the one that I like the most.

740
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,700
And I really, oh, I like Mr. The Fantastic Fox, something like that.

741
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,540
I really like that one.

742
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:09,340
And then the rest I don't really like, like Darjeeling Unlimited or whatever.

743
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,940
Oh no, I love that film.

744
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:16,340
Yeah, so I didn't really like it, but then what else?

745
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:22,340
His most recent ones I didn't like, the past three, Hotels, no the Hotel Chavalier was

746
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,060
a short film I think.

747
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,380
Yeah, that's a short film.

748
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:31,980
That one I really totally liked though, that one I liked, and that wasn't comedic at all.

749
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:32,980
Yeah.

750
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:37,380
Yeah, so it was strange that people said it was Wes Anderson, it's only because I love

751
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,300
like straight-ons of people.

752
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,620
I love straight-ons, and just for people who aren't into film, that just means you film

753
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:47,380
a character straight-on and not at an angle, like they're looking almost at the barrel

754
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,380
of the lens.

755
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,740
I love that.

756
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:54,900
And I guess Wes Anderson does that too, so that's pretty much the only, maybe Whip Pans.

757
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:59,260
Maybe that and Whip Pans is the, but for me, I wrote that in the script, like I wasn't

758
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:06,660
even thinking Wes Anderson, I just, that was just a better scene transition than a cut.

759
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,060
It just, it flowed better.

760
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:14,300
Like I could see it while I was writing it, that if it was a cut, it would be 5% different

761
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,180
in terms of the emotion that I wanted to evoke.

762
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,660
So I was like, okay, I can make it.

763
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,500
How do you define people, like actors especially?

764
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,500
Mandy.

765
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,300
Just Mandy, that's it.

766
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:29,380
A little bit through this website called My Goalio, which is this new website.

767
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:35,020
And then you went by faces for actors or did they audition for it and you were like, okay,

768
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,180
not you, not you, not you, you, yes.

769
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,180
Yeah.

770
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,180
It was like Tinder.

771
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:43,060
It was like swiping on Tinder, especially for the women, because there's, but not because

772
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,020
I'm just going for who looks good.

773
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:49,380
I'm just going for like who looks like the role that I, like you have to, first, the

774
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:53,100
first filter is you have to look like the person that I want you to look like.

775
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,660
And then the second thing is like, then you have to act it.

776
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:01,140
So I could eliminate a lot of the people just by like swiping left or archiving or whatever.

777
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,140
Yeah.

778
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:05,300
And same with the guys too.

779
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,580
How long was the process?

780
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:12,780
Pre-production started two weeks before production, like it was so hectic, man.

781
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,100
And we were doing pre-production while we're doing production too.

782
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:24,020
In fact, the guy who played the lead role, Hanny, the second lead, it was going to be

783
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:26,660
someone completely different than his schedule changed.

784
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,380
And he was the most ideal person.

785
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,980
And then he was quoting me some crazy amount of money that he wanted.

786
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,900
And then it was like just per day, even if it was one hour, but it was a crazy amount,

787
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:40,900
like more money than my cinematographer is being paid, more money than like even my cinematographer

788
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,820
and producer together are being paid.

789
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,820
And he's not even that good.

790
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,940
He's not like, I don't know why he wanted that.

791
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:50,340
I think he was doing that as a way to get out, but whatever.

792
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,620
So I couldn't get him.

793
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,460
And then he wouldn't even guarantee me dates.

794
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:57,180
So I'm like, I was thinking like, if I'm going to pay you that much, you better say that

795
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,980
you're free on the dates that I want you to be free if I'm telling you in advance.

796
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,260
And he's like, no, I can't do those dates.

797
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:10,460
But anyway, so then we got Hanny, the guy who played his name, Sean Ray, and this is

798
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,460
not good.

799
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:17,580
Sean Ray wouldn't want to hear this, but like he was like our, we were just like, I personally

800
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,540
was like, fuck it, fine.

801
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,540
We'll just get this guy.

802
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,540
Like seriously, I feel so bad.

803
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,740
He did a really good job though.

804
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:28,740
No, he did a great job, but like at the time when I watched his audition, I was watching

805
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,740
a bunch of auditions.

806
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:35,060
The whole theme of the script, the whole theme of the movie after a while became fuck it,

807
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,060
whatever.

808
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:39,940
Like for every little decision, like certain things would start to go wrong and or like

809
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:44,540
you just never ideal, then you just say fuck it, whatever, just move on.

810
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:48,660
Even to this, to the supporting lead, like we're watching the auditions, he, he sucked

811
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,660
the least.

812
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:53,340
I was like, ah, fuck it, we'll just cast him.

813
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,340
So we got him to come in.

814
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:58,360
I told him it was an audition and it was, but we set up lights and everything.

815
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:02,640
We set up the whole scene with the fog machine, with the labs, with everything so that we

816
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,960
could film it at the same time so that if it did work, we could put it in the film.

817
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,720
And then that scene ended up going in the film.

818
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,280
It was the one where he had to ADR because that was one with the dialogue that was the

819
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,280
worst.

820
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,280
Yeah.

821
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,760
But no, he ended up being really good.

822
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,960
I didn't want him to do the accent.

823
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,160
I first, I put that in the script and then I thought the accent was too silly and I didn't

824
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,640
want that in the movie.

825
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:29,040
But then Khan and Jess and the, and someone else that was there just said like, no, the

826
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,040
accent's good.

827
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,040
The accent's good.

828
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,040
I'm like, whatever.

829
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,240
We did multiple takes with the accent without, for that one scene.

830
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,080
And then I was like, okay, fine, we'll, we'll put the accent in and everybody loved him

831
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,080
a lot.

832
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,080
Yeah.

833
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,080
Like people were surprised he doesn't even have that accent.

834
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,680
No, he's doing a really good job.

835
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,680
Yeah, he's the, he's the best actor.

836
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,100
I'm the worst actor.

837
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,280
And then it goes, I have, I'm pretty bad.

838
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,600
I don't think you're too bad.

839
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,600
I'm like cracking.

840
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,200
I'm like laughing at certain scenes.

841
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,240
It was, it was, I was okay.

842
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,240
Fine.

843
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,240
I was okay.

844
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,240
I was better than the, I don't want to say the other people that weren't that good, but

845
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,240
yeah.

846
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,240
Do you have the second movie planned?

847
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,240
I do.

848
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,240
Yeah.

849
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,240
What's that?

850
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,760
So, so that one's going to be a big, big movie.

851
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,200
I can talk about that later.

852
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,200
I can't talk about things.

853
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,200
It's not that planned.

854
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:18,840
That's why it's very in its infancy, but it's going to be, it's going to be like, I keep

855
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:25,880
But it's going to be considered to be one of the greatest movies ever made.

856
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,200
And people are like, oh yeah, sure.

857
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,200
Well, that's good.

858
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,200
You're shamed for that.

859
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,760
That's like how people think it, but I'm, I'm serious.

860
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,360
Like it's going to be that good.

861
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:40,080
Like we know how there's the standard top 100, which is like Citizen Kane, Godfather,

862
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,400
I don't know, Shawshank maybe.

863
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,400
It's going to be up there.

864
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,080
It's like, it will almost, it's going to be good.

865
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,600
My next one's going to be amazing.

866
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,080
Then my third one, I have that one kind of planned.

867
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:56,520
That one is not going to be in terms of, it's going to be good.

868
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,520
It's going to be great.

869
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,880
To me, it'll be even better than my second, but it won't be considered by critics and

870
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,800
stuff to be like the top 100, but that one will change people's lives.

871
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:11,040
Like my third one is like one that will like make you be like, oh, like rethink a lot of

872
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,040
stuff.

873
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:15,640
That one's, my third one's a very thought provoking one.

874
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,640
Interesting.

875
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,640
Yeah.

876
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,440
Have you started a process of writing a script for both of them at the same time?

877
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,440
No.

878
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,600
I just have the idea for the third one and I kind of have the idea for the second one

879
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,120
that I'm writing still.

880
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,120
Yeah.

881
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:34,840
You mentioned that you have a special kind of passion for Toronto and you want to do

882
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:41,160
with Toronto what Woody Allen did with New York.

883
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:45,880
What makes you so interested in Toronto and are your future movies also going to be in

884
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,480
Toronto and all your movies are going to be in Toronto?

885
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,240
At least the next two, right, because I haven't planned and I have something interesting planned

886
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,360
for how I'm going to do my second one about Toronto.

887
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:59,000
It's going to almost be like, not CG, but like it's going to be a changed, it's a Toronto

888
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:05,080
you haven't seen, like a very tweaked Toronto, kind of like her, like slightly futuristic,

889
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:09,600
but it's not really, it's not a future in this movie.

890
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:14,360
It's not like a science fiction, so her is like kind of fantasy in the future.

891
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:21,240
This is not that, but anyway, yeah, it's going to be in Toronto and the reason why, I don't

892
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,800
know, I have an irrational love for Toronto.

893
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:28,960
It's irrational, just like you're not so smart tells me in the book, but really I have no

894
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,640
reason to love the city that much other than it's the first world country, which is great

895
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:38,560
and like I always, I constantly tell people, people ask me like, what's something you do

896
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,560
for fun?

897
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:46,320
And something I love to do is like just walk around downtown at night with just the streetlights

898
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,320
and just everything.

899
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:53,000
Like I feel, there's like this childlike sort of like, I feel so happy, so like content

900
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,920
and happy and like, and grateful, I'm like, look at all these things we have that everybody's

901
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,160
just walking past and they don't even care about, but like we have like paved, first

902
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,800
of all, we have paved roads and not just like any paved, they're great, they're like normal

903
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:12,560
roads, they're not like Trinidad roads in my country.

904
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,440
So they're great, we have clean water, anytime we want, we can just get clean water.

905
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,360
We don't even have to, we can go to a store and it's...

906
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:22,320
Clean water apparently is not the case across Canada, but it is in Toronto definitely.

907
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,320
Sure, okay, so let's say Toronto, yeah.

908
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,440
So that's what I'm saying, like how good we have it here.

909
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,440
So clean water.

910
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,560
Oh, this is like heaven.

911
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,200
It's amazing, like the worst...

912
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,080
Not like heaven, this is heaven.

913
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:38,960
Like a homeless person here has it better than like the average Nigerian or whatever,

914
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:39,960
so choose something.

915
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,880
Yeah, like 90% population of the world probably.

916
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:48,640
Yeah, so it's really cool and people are so, they don't really appreciate it.

917
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:53,400
It's not that people don't appreciate it, people want more and I think that's what,

918
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:57,000
it's one of those things of being a human.

919
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,960
This is something that bothers me about that whole 1%, 99% thing, I really hate that whole

920
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,680
movement.

921
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,160
I hate anybody that...

922
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,520
I don't like that movement either.

923
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:10,160
Anybody that talks about inequality, I could not care, I could not care less about inequality,

924
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,680
I couldn't, because here's my argument for any, about the whole thing.

925
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:18,920
So if you are part of the 99% and you're just middle class or like, let's say even lower

926
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,400
middle class, okay?

927
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,240
Of course poverty line like, even the poverty line is like okay compared to other countries,

928
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,440
but let's just talk about lower middle class, okay?

929
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,440
You're talking about here.

930
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,240
Yeah, so here in the States, here and the States, okay?

931
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:38,880
You have it, you are living like royalty lived like a thousand years ago, not royalty but

932
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,680
like the rich lived a thousand years ago, way better than them.

933
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:46,440
You have cell phones, you have like right angles on streets and like all these, you

934
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,160
have cars and do you know what I mean?

935
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:53,000
Like you have it better, why do you care if someone else has it even better than you if

936
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
you have it good?

937
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,680
You should never look at someone else's plate and be like, why do they have more food?

938
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,120
You should look at your own plate and do I have enough and maybe look at someone else

939
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,720
and be like, do they have enough?

940
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:04,800
But don't look at someone else and be like, I should be having that, that sort of feeling

941
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:10,760
of being jealous and being like, oh it's unfair, it's unfair that they have more.

942
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,680
Who cares as long as you're satisfied.

943
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,120
That's exactly how they feel though.

944
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:20,280
I know but that's, to me that's, it's like, it doesn't, it's so irrational like you're,

945
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,280
you have every...

946
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,080
It's not irrational for them, it's irrational.

947
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,480
No, it's real to them but it's still irrational.

948
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:34,560
For you and for me and for people who have certain kind of comfort, that's the thing.

949
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:38,800
That's what I mean by not all of us experiencing the same reality.

950
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:45,360
Here's the thing, here's the thing, if I told you, if I just, people's concept of what happy

951
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,200
is is like so fucked up, that's why I have something against happiness but I can go on

952
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,840
for like hours about that but like, so people say, if I ask you, let's take someone who's

953
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:54,840
happy okay?

954
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:56,800
So are you happy?

955
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,800
And they say yes.

956
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,040
I'm like okay, can you list out all the reasons why you're happy?

957
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:05,440
And then they're like, okay, I can go to a restaurant whenever I want, I can blah blah

958
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,640
blah, I have kids that love me blah blah, okay?

959
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:14,360
Then I say, okay by the way, that's great, now did you know that there are aliens that

960
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:17,800
live and they live in like, you didn't know this but they live like right on the outer

961
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:23,800
atmosphere of earth and they live in this great like hunger games, like palace of like

962
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:29,120
royalty and it turns out that you can actually fly as a human but they've limited you and

963
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,120
you can't fly.

964
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,120
Are you happy?

965
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,800
Most people would be like no, what the fuck, that's fucked up.

966
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:38,080
But what on that list that you just wrote down that made you happy has changed?

967
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:41,880
That list is exactly the same, you should still be happy but now you feel like oh I'm

968
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,840
missing out on something and then that makes you unhappy?

969
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,840
Your list has not changed.

970
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,560
Yeah, they want to be special.

971
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,520
That bothers me so much.

972
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,840
So your happiness is relative to other people's?

973
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,720
Yeah, for them.

974
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,280
I'm not saying it's right, I think it's-

975
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,280
I know, that's just-

976
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:00,560
But that's not going to change, it's just a matter of evolution, I think chimps are like

977
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,560
that.

978
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:04,760
Exactly, exactly, there's the whole thing about the chimp and the grapes.

979
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:08,920
I've always thought if we want to understand people really well, we have to start watching

980
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:14,440
a lot of documentaries about chimps because that explains a lot, the jealousy, greed-

981
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:19,520
Right, no, they have evolutionary roots but that doesn't mean that they're okay.

982
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:24,600
Just like, I'm not looking at someone being unjust and then looking at a chimp yelling

983
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,600
about not getting enough grapes and being like, oh yeah, well that chimp really had

984
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:32,840
a point, that chimp is really smart and really deduced based on logic and reason behind that.

985
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:38,040
For the chimp's logic and reason, that's the thing, how are we going to compare a human

986
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,680
logic and reason with chimp's logic and reason?

987
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,400
But that's what they're doing.

988
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,720
I have the same feeling about religion and extremely religious people, that they just

989
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:53,200
buy into that fact because that gives them a sense of purpose and that's a problem I

990
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,200
think.

991
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:58,920
When you say it's rational to them, what do you mean?

992
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,520
Because okay, I can see how they can think it's rational.

993
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:07,800
What I mean is that I'm going to quote David Lynch, a great director and philosopher I

994
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:14,080
would say, that if you have a golf ball size consciousness, your understanding of the world

995
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,840
is a golf ball size.

996
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:21,200
If you have a box, that's the amount of your understanding of the world.

997
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,520
If it's infinite, okay, okay, fine.

998
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:30,960
So what I would say, what they are experiencing, you know, that triangle of our crucial needs

999
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,120
and stuff, it starts with, yeah.

1000
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:42,560
So they have less amount of security and comfort and ease of mind than you, me and privileged

1001
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,560
people.

1002
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:47,360
It's not that we're privileged, but we're pretty comfortable.

1003
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:51,880
Yeah, okay, I know what you're going to say, sorry to cut you off, but what I would say

1004
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:56,960
to that is like, there's a difference between something being rational to them and it being

1005
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,200
rational.

1006
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,960
So objectively rational.

1007
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,400
I don't think there is such a thing as objective rationality.

1008
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,160
Oh, well, we can talk about that another time.

1009
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,160
Yeah.

1010
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:17,840
I think we, there are certain laws like gravity and yeah, but nothing like related, even,

1011
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:21,000
you know, related to morality at all.

1012
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,520
What about Sam Harris's whole moral landscape?

1013
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,520
I love that book.

1014
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,680
And do you not agree with it?

1015
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:29,680
I don't know.

1016
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:37,640
I think he changed also a lot of, not a lot, but some way of thinking about his too.

1017
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,560
After that book came out, you mean?

1018
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:45,340
There is a bit, I see the difference between moral landscape and wake up, right, or waking

1019
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:46,340
up.

1020
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:47,340
Yeah.

1021
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:48,340
I don't know.

1022
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:49,340
Which one did you like more?

1023
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:50,340
Can I guess?

1024
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:51,340
Yeah.

1025
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:55,800
I think you like waking up more.

1026
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,800
I think so too.

1027
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,800
Yeah.

1028
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,960
So I really liked the moral landscape a lot and I just didn't like waking up.

1029
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:02,960
Yeah.

1030
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:03,960
Yeah.

1031
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:09,840
I listened to it and I was like, no, well, I mean, he just talks about spirituality,

1032
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,480
but there's nothing there that was like a new idea to me.

1033
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,680
It was more like just talking about spirituality.

1034
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:20,440
I basically like him coming to that place that he considers that, which I think is pretty

1035
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,440
cool.

1036
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,840
And just so your listeners aren't confused, when Sam Harris talks about spirituality,

1037
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,240
it's not like regular people talking about spirituality.

1038
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:31,280
He just, he's using that as a word because he has no other word to do.

1039
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,920
He's a neuroscientist philosopher who...

1040
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:35,920
Atheist too.

1041
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:36,920
Atheist.

1042
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,040
One of the greatest atheists.

1043
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,680
So let me ask you two final questions.

1044
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:46,400
The first one would be, what is the purpose of life?

1045
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,400
There is no purpose.

1046
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,760
A purpose kind of to me implies some sort of higher being.

1047
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:54,960
That's another reason why I have something against the word deserved.

1048
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:59,320
When anybody says, oh, you deserve this, there's something that irks me inside.

1049
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,320
And women say that a lot.

1050
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,880
This is all ties back to...

1051
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,840
We didn't get to talk deeply about your hatred for women.

1052
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,080
No, but women say this thing all the time.

1053
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,240
They're like, girl, you deserve that break.

1054
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,240
You deserve...

1055
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,720
Girls use the word deserve like far too much.

1056
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,000
Explain to me one sentence.

1057
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,360
What is the core difference between men and women?

1058
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,800
Oh, there's so many.

1059
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:26,760
So I'll tell you, a man's sort of power and status in his life comes from him struggling

1060
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,240
hard to make it.

1061
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,280
Okay, unless you're just really good looking, which there are very few guys that are good

1062
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:37,440
looking and just make it off their good looks, versus a girl who can just be...

1063
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,960
When I say girls, I'm talking about like, let's say you're seven and a half and above,

1064
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,560
because then if you're six and below, you're just...

1065
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:47,720
If you're five and below, you're like, I'm sorry, you might as well be a man.

1066
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:51,400
So I'm talking about like a certain status of women, okay?

1067
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:58,560
So if you're a woman, then you just like, guys would just like, take your luggage for

1068
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,160
you, just do everything for you.

1069
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,160
I remember I was...

1070
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:05,720
There's a story about this guy who did stand up for like 30 years, was doing great.

1071
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:09,200
Finally like, he went off stage, like everyone's applauding and like turning heads and stuff.

1072
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,200
I'm like, he's like, yeah, I feel good.

1073
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,600
Then some hot girl came in like two minutes later and all the heads turned to look at

1074
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:19,880
her in the same way that he got looked at because he was a celebrity.

1075
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:23,080
That's just quintessentially, that's what you have to do as a man.

1076
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:27,920
Those 30 years of experience to just kind of equal what a girl gets automatically.

1077
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:32,760
Yeah, but you should look at countries like Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan and those places

1078
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:39,320
that they keep their women in the closet and in the beekeeping suit and they can't even

1079
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,320
drive.

1080
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:47,880
So who gives a fuck if somebody can't get drinks or applause because they have big boobs?

1081
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:54,720
People are attracted to big boobs and they are to male physics, majority of people.

1082
00:56:54,720 --> 00:57:04,440
I think we should all sort of aspire to be like Saudi Arabia and I'm just kidding.

1083
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:08,880
So I'm only talking about the Western world, of course.

1084
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I don't care about the...

1085
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,240
I mean, I do care but I'm not ranting about...

1086
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:19,000
I'm not like gonna go tell a woman who's getting acid in her face like, yo, well, you had it

1087
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,320
good your whole life so now you get acid.

1088
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,000
I'm not gonna tell that, you know.

1089
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,040
So I'm talking about like...

1090
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,560
And then there's so much more awareness of women's issues than there are men but yet

1091
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,880
the society thinks it's totally the opposite.

1092
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:38,520
The way society thinks like, if you grew up in the 80s, if you were born in the 80s and

1093
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,880
above, you're just feminized.

1094
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,640
It's all liberal arts, like every...

1095
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:51,200
Even the word rape was only very recently made to incorporate a man.

1096
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,240
People think that women were more oppressed than they were.

1097
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,160
People think that women make $0.75...

1098
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,320
Oh, it's much better than it used to be.

1099
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,560
No, but also people think that...

1100
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:05,920
There are still a lot of problems like pay is a big deal, you know, call paying.

1101
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,160
No, but that's been shown to be false.

1102
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:13,600
Like, so another thing I used to study was economics like a little bit and there's so

1103
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:18,920
many economics, economic like just things about money that people are wrong about.

1104
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,920
So the whole $0.75 a dollar thing is shown to be false.

1105
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:27,920
If you make everything equal, like you try to control for, does this girl have the same

1106
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:28,960
education as the guy?

1107
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,080
Has she stayed in the company the same as the guy, the same position?

1108
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,840
Then they get paid the same.

1109
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,160
It turns out they get paid the same.

1110
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:43,040
The difference is like if you add up, like in total, how much money do women make?

1111
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,040
How much money do men make?

1112
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:48,120
It's about 75% of what men make, something like that, okay?

1113
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:51,600
And then that comes in because women make different choices, they go into different

1114
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:52,600
fields.

1115
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:56,320
Men tend to go into engineering or whatever, women tend to go into whatever, other things

1116
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,320
that pay like...

1117
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:02,720
So you're saying the women who go to engineering do not have equal pay to men who are engineers?

1118
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,920
Oh, well then you have to also account for did they have kids?

1119
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,360
Did they take time off of work?

1120
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:10,660
So if you account for all these things and did a man take time off of work, blah, blah,

1121
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:13,520
if you account for those things and you hold them, that's what you have to do in science

1122
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:17,880
before you make a correlation between variables, you have to fix every other thing to say that

1123
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:22,880
these things are the causation, there's a cause and effect.

1124
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,200
Then it turns out that the pays are equal.

1125
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,120
And so I could just send you so many videos on that.

1126
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:30,680
There's search pay wage gap myth or something like that.

1127
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,080
There's tons of videos about that.

1128
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,800
Yeah, it's a myth.

1129
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:37,720
Are you following US politics, US election campaigns?

1130
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:45,040
No, no, I don't know who Bernie Sanders is and I don't know, I want...

1131
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,680
I would love it if Trump got elected.

1132
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,800
I kind of like what he says.

1133
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:55,400
A lot of people say like, yeah, Trump sucks, like, oh, why?

1134
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,080
He's just a negative man.

1135
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:01,240
That's not even like an argument against like, what particular policy...

1136
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:05,760
Well, you know, actually, we were talking on the first episode of this podcast how I'm

1137
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:10,400
going to support Donald Trump if Bernie Sanders don't get the Democratic candidacy because

1138
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,060
Hillary Clinton is the other person.

1139
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:19,160
But she brought Sarah Palin to the game and that's where he lost me because that is just...

1140
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,160
Trump brought Palin?

1141
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,160
Yeah.

1142
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,160
It's just...

1143
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,160
Marketing.

1144
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:28,600
It is, but I mean, to what kind of people is just bringing shit show, you know?

1145
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:31,600
Anyways, let me ask you the final question.

1146
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:38,320
If you come across an intelligent alien from a different civilization, what would you tell

1147
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:44,320
that intelligent alien as the worst things that humanity has done and what would you

1148
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:47,160
tell that alien as the best thing that we have achieved?

1149
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:50,160
Oh, that's a very good question.

1150
01:00:50,160 --> 01:01:01,160
Um, the worst thing is like, just torture, just people being tortured.

1151
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:10,160
Like how, just, you know, like, obviously people will say, yeah, the US torture is going

1152
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,160
to be...

1153
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:12,160
Well, okay, fine, whatever.

1154
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,160
It's in the US too.

1155
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:18,560
But also Japan and like World War II, like some of this stuff they did is crazy and no

1156
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:21,560
one hears about it because it's just not taught, they talk more about Germany.

1157
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:28,560
So like it's like, I used to just, like I said, how sometimes I want to get mad at things.

1158
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,720
Like I want to get mad at that girl on my Facebook.

1159
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:34,760
Sometimes I want to know, I want to know the real, how the world really is.

1160
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,800
Even if it makes me like feel sad and depressed.

1161
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:40,720
So sometimes I'd like purposely go out of the way to search for depressing facts just

1162
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:45,720
because I feel like to get a sort of broad-eyed, bird's-eye view of everything.

1163
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,680
Some of the things Japan did was fucked up.

1164
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:52,360
So just suffering and torture is the worst.

1165
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,000
I don't particularly care about slavery.

1166
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:59,480
I mean, no, don't misconstruing me anybody in the future.

1167
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:04,960
What I mean is like, to me, slavery compared to suffering, compared to torturing, sorry,

1168
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:05,960
is not that bad.

1169
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,920
Unless you torture your slaves.

1170
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,920
There's nothing that compares to torture.

1171
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:13,840
So torture is the worst that humanity does.

1172
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:17,440
Even to animals, I really hate that.

1173
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:33,480
The best thing is, I don't know, the internet, the internet, something like that.

1174
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:37,240
Yeah, it's probably something like that.

1175
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:45,280
Or whatever is the start of a technological revolution that would eventually make the

1176
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,280
internet anyway.

1177
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:49,520
And the internet's going to make something else and make those other things and singularity,

1178
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,520
blah, blah, blah.

1179
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:53,240
So whatever started that, that was the best thing.

1180
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:56,320
Because without it, we wouldn't be on that thing to the singularity.

1181
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,720
And I think the singularity is going to be the best thing.

1182
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:04,520
But whatever starts it is obviously also good because it started us into an almost inevitable

1183
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,400
push to the singularity.

1184
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:13,680
Like Ray Kurzweil shows, even past World War I and World War II, that law of accelerated

1185
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:17,600
returns doesn't even perturb, despite World Wars.

1186
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,080
It's almost like inevitable.

1187
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,200
So yeah.
