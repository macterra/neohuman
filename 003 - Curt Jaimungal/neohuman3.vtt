00:00.000 --> 00:03.120
People's concept of what's hap- what happy is is like so fucked up.

00:03.120 --> 00:04.920
That's why I have something against happiness.

00:12.920 --> 00:18.000
Hello, and welcome to the third episode of Neo Human Podcast.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.160
I'm Agabahari.

00:19.160 --> 00:24.200
You can follow me on Twitter and Instagram at Agologist.

00:24.200 --> 00:29.800
And you can follow the show on Live in Limbo at liveinlimbo.com.

00:29.800 --> 00:43.120
So for the third episode, I'm here with Kurt Jaimungal, who is a physics and math grad

00:43.120 --> 00:48.240
from University of Toronto, and he is a filmmaker now.

00:48.240 --> 00:53.320
So when did you graduate from a physics and math program?

00:53.320 --> 00:57.480
Like I spent way too long in undergrad.

00:57.480 --> 00:59.680
Why did you choose that field?

00:59.760 --> 01:01.800
I love- I still love physics and math.

01:01.800 --> 01:09.960
When I was a kid, my dad would make me learn math and chess and stuff at like a really

01:09.960 --> 01:10.960
young age.

01:10.960 --> 01:12.760
He would like pressure me and I hated that.

01:12.760 --> 01:17.400
And I didn't like him at a young age because of that because it was like a lot of pressure.

01:17.400 --> 01:20.400
Even I remember I wanted to watch The Simpsons one time.

01:20.400 --> 01:25.840
And so I was playing- he would make me play blindfolded chess with my sister.

01:25.840 --> 01:26.840
So I would be blindfolded.

01:26.840 --> 01:32.680
My sister is allowed to be not blindfolded because she wasn't as good as me.

01:32.680 --> 01:34.240
So I would be blindfolded.

01:34.240 --> 01:37.280
And then I was just making mistakes on purpose because I knew the new Simpsons episode was

01:37.280 --> 01:40.440
coming on and my dad saw this and he physically cut the cable.

01:40.440 --> 01:42.280
And then I went upstairs crying.

01:42.280 --> 01:45.280
I went upstairs crying and my mom woke up and then she's like, Paul.

01:45.280 --> 01:47.600
My dad's like, Paul, what are you doing to the child?

01:47.600 --> 01:50.280
She's like, he's like, Christ, that's my mom's name.

01:50.280 --> 01:51.280
Just yelling at each other.

01:51.280 --> 01:53.800
And then I'm crying in my room and I don't have TV.

01:53.800 --> 01:54.800
I can't do anything.

01:54.800 --> 01:55.800
I just have to sit in the dark.

01:56.760 --> 02:01.600
Yeah, so I was just kind of pressured from a young age to do like analytical things.

02:01.600 --> 02:04.440
Was your dad a- or is your dad an academic?

02:04.440 --> 02:09.440
Oh, well he's a teacher, but of woodworking.

02:09.440 --> 02:14.120
Although he studied chemistry in university.

02:14.120 --> 02:18.320
He just wanted his kids- like, you know, when I was- even my brother- my brother went through

02:18.320 --> 02:19.800
worse than what I did.

02:19.800 --> 02:22.280
So you had two brothers, one sister?

02:22.280 --> 02:23.280
One brother, two sisters.

02:23.520 --> 02:24.520
It's like two boys, two girls.

02:24.520 --> 02:25.520
Oh, okay.

02:25.520 --> 02:26.520
Yeah.

02:26.520 --> 02:31.720
And like when I was a kid, it's that classic thing of like the parents say, like, you'll

02:31.720 --> 02:32.720
thank me later.

02:32.720 --> 02:37.600
And I really- I wish that he was harder on me because it really helped me out throughout

02:37.600 --> 02:38.600
the rest of my life.

02:38.600 --> 02:39.600
Oh, yeah?

02:39.600 --> 02:44.200
Because, you know, I was learning- I was learning calculus in grade three.

02:44.200 --> 02:48.840
Like actual calculus and integral calculus, not just regular calculus.

02:48.840 --> 02:54.560
So when you talk about your childhood, would you categorize it as a good or bad childhood?

02:54.560 --> 02:55.560
Good.

02:55.560 --> 02:58.000
I'd say it's pretty good.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
I'd say it's pretty good.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.440
Aside from that stuff, I had a pretty good childhood.

03:03.440 --> 03:06.120
Which was bad because it didn't prepare me for like the crappy adulthood.

03:06.120 --> 03:07.120
Was it in Canada?

03:07.120 --> 03:08.120
Yeah.

03:08.120 --> 03:09.120
Yeah.

03:09.120 --> 03:10.120
Everything's in Canada.

03:10.120 --> 03:11.120
Yeah.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.120
In Toronto.

03:12.120 --> 03:13.120
Yeah, in Toronto.

03:13.120 --> 03:14.120
That's awesome.

03:14.120 --> 03:15.120
Born and raised.

03:15.120 --> 03:16.120
Basically born and raised.

03:16.120 --> 03:20.800
But I mean, I came here when I was like two months old or three months old.

03:20.800 --> 03:21.800
Yeah.

03:21.800 --> 03:22.800
Yeah.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.320
And then I always liked math and physics.

03:24.320 --> 03:28.400
I always liked math in particular.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.400
And then physics.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.760
I forgot how physics came about.

03:31.760 --> 03:37.360
I think my brother was explaining something to me about quantum fluctuations one time.

03:37.360 --> 03:40.600
This was when Blockbuster was still around.

03:40.600 --> 03:46.080
And then I remember finding that fascinating that particles can come in and out of existence.

03:46.080 --> 03:48.240
Like just like that.

03:48.240 --> 03:51.440
Because all I knew was that you cannot create or destroy anything.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.960
And then he's telling me, no, you can.

03:53.960 --> 03:56.080
It's just in very small time scales you can.

03:56.080 --> 03:57.400
And it happens all the time.

03:57.400 --> 03:58.400
Happening in front of us right now.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.000
It happens in between atoms.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.320
Like anytime there's empty space, that's happening.

04:03.320 --> 04:04.320
And that fascinated me.

04:04.320 --> 04:07.240
I think I just from there, I always looked up like physics.

04:07.240 --> 04:09.840
Yeah, so I always loved physics.

04:09.880 --> 04:19.280
When you say coming in and going out of existence, in existence it's very tangible.

04:19.280 --> 04:21.600
It's understandable.

04:21.600 --> 04:28.240
What is out of existence from the point of view of a person who is passionate about physics

04:28.240 --> 04:31.720
and has studied physics?

04:31.720 --> 04:33.520
Let's say you have empty spaces.

04:33.520 --> 04:34.520
There's nothing in it.

04:34.520 --> 04:35.520
Right.

04:35.520 --> 04:38.840
This is a vacuum is what they call it.

04:38.840 --> 04:42.680
And then so you're looking at this vacuum and there's nothing.

04:42.680 --> 04:48.240
But then what happens is out of this nothing, you'll see an electron and then an anti-electron

04:48.240 --> 04:49.800
appear and then collide.

04:49.800 --> 04:54.560
An anti-electron, whenever antimatter collides with regular matter, matter will destroy itself.

04:54.560 --> 04:57.040
Usually it destroys itself in energy.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.920
So a photon will be emitted.

04:59.920 --> 05:08.000
But in these little anti-particle pairs, they'll come in and out of existence like this constantly.

05:08.160 --> 05:12.680
I'm making a gesture with my hands that no one can see.

05:12.680 --> 05:19.440
Yeah, so there's nothing, they come and then they go like, yeah.

05:19.440 --> 05:23.280
Where are they coming from?

05:23.280 --> 05:31.040
It doesn't mean that they're coming from somewhere, it's just that it's like the laws say that,

05:31.040 --> 05:34.120
okay, you've heard of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, right?

05:34.120 --> 05:35.440
Yes, but say it anyways.

05:35.880 --> 05:41.740
This basically comes from Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which says you can't simultaneously

05:41.740 --> 05:53.840
measure a particle's position with 100% accuracy and know its momentum with any accuracy.

05:53.840 --> 05:57.660
There's a trade-off between knowing how sure are you of its position and how sure are you

05:57.660 --> 05:58.880
of its momentum.

05:58.880 --> 06:02.720
If you try and measure one with a certain degree of accuracy, it will limit the other's

06:02.720 --> 06:05.080
accuracy.

06:05.080 --> 06:11.760
So people normally kind of say it like, imagine you're playing like billiard balls, I mean,

06:11.760 --> 06:17.640
you're playing pool, and let's say it's dark, okay, so you can't see the balls but you can

06:17.640 --> 06:21.200
only shoot another ball at the ball that you're trying to measure.

06:21.200 --> 06:26.000
You're trying to figure out where is this white ball, let's say, okay?

06:26.000 --> 06:29.200
So the only way you can know is if you interact with it by throwing other balls.

06:29.200 --> 06:33.120
So usually that's photons, we're looking at something, we're interacting with it by looking

06:33.120 --> 06:34.120
at it, right?

06:34.160 --> 06:36.800
Photons are being emitted to it.

06:36.800 --> 06:41.120
So let's say we're trying to find out where this white ball is.

06:41.120 --> 06:44.480
We don't know, the white ball could be moving, it could have momentum, momentum just like

06:44.480 --> 06:47.820
velocity and speed, okay?

06:47.820 --> 06:50.880
It could be moving or it could be still and we don't know where on the board it is, so

06:50.880 --> 06:51.880
we're just shooting.

06:51.880 --> 06:56.200
Let's say we shoot it with the ball.

06:56.200 --> 06:57.280
This is such a bad analogy.

06:57.280 --> 07:07.000
So basically, the harder you hit the white ball, let's say I use my billiard ball to

07:07.000 --> 07:11.640
hit the white ball really hard, okay, and the white ball goes flying off somewhere but

07:11.640 --> 07:16.000
my ball stays right where the white ball was, okay, like I just hit it and then my ball

07:16.000 --> 07:20.840
stays and the white ball goes there, then I'll know like, oh, I have a pretty good idea

07:20.840 --> 07:25.080
of where the position was of that white ball but now I don't know its momentum anymore

07:25.480 --> 07:27.760
because I just changed it.

07:27.760 --> 07:35.720
Whereas before, I could kind of like go very softly to it and let's say the white ball

07:35.720 --> 07:41.120
is moving and I go very softly with my billiard ball to hit it, my billiard ball will move

07:41.120 --> 07:46.600
a little bit and I won't really know its position but that's such a bad analogy.

07:46.600 --> 07:50.960
But anyway, it's like basically, there's a trade-off.

07:50.960 --> 07:54.200
But then here's the thing that most people don't know is that the trade-off doesn't happen

07:54.200 --> 07:58.040
because we suck at observing or there's some human thing.

07:58.040 --> 08:03.640
The trade-off is even the atom itself doesn't know its own momentum and position accurately.

08:03.640 --> 08:04.640
That's what's the interesting thing.

08:04.640 --> 08:11.400
Is this the same thing with when it's being observed, it behaves as a particle and when

08:11.400 --> 08:13.480
it's not observed, it behaves as waves?

08:13.480 --> 08:18.200
No, it behaves as both even when you observe it and when you don't observe it.

08:18.200 --> 08:23.960
What they're saying is it lives in a superposition of like up and down, left and right, all these

08:24.000 --> 08:26.720
things simultaneously until you observe it, then it chooses one.

08:26.720 --> 08:27.720
Right.

08:27.720 --> 08:35.800
That's just an interpretation of quantum mechanics that like that...

08:35.800 --> 08:40.560
The equations kind of imply that but it's just an implication, right?

08:40.560 --> 08:44.200
Like there's many different other implications, different interpretations of what the equations

08:44.200 --> 08:45.200
mean.

08:45.200 --> 08:49.400
All we know is these equations are the most accurate equations in all of science.

08:49.520 --> 08:59.360
They're the most tested of any sort of scientific field even more than cellular biology or whatever.

08:59.360 --> 09:04.320
These equations are correct down to the degree of accuracy of like, let's say you're trying

09:04.320 --> 09:11.480
to measure the earth and your measurement is within a marble, like within a penny's

09:11.480 --> 09:14.360
sort of length of like the radius of the earth.

09:14.360 --> 09:15.780
That's your error.

09:15.780 --> 09:18.980
That's also how accurate we can measure certain things quantum mechanically.

09:18.980 --> 09:21.660
Like of course we just go down to the scale of that.

09:21.660 --> 09:23.900
How long has it been since we developed this?

09:23.900 --> 09:25.700
That's 100 years now.

09:25.700 --> 09:26.700
100 years.

09:26.700 --> 09:34.740
Basically, what I'm understanding from this conversation so far is that physics has attempted

09:34.740 --> 09:43.460
to explain the world and life and the universe and has succeeded in your opinion and maybe

09:43.580 --> 09:48.260
my opinion and in the opinion of a lot of people has succeeded greatly but there is

09:48.260 --> 09:50.460
a huge amount that we still don't know about.

09:50.460 --> 09:54.740
There are things that we don't know that we don't know.

09:54.740 --> 10:01.660
Is physics in general and physics departments around Canada and United States getting the

10:01.660 --> 10:06.500
budget from your point of view because you experienced a university life as well?

10:06.500 --> 10:12.900
Getting the budget that they need to test and prove a lot of these theories in order

10:12.940 --> 10:18.300
to explain more so we can understand more or is there a problem in that department?

10:18.300 --> 10:21.980
No, there's this cool book, this really cool book, the same book that we were listening

10:21.980 --> 10:26.380
to in the car, that towards the end of the book the guy kind of goes on this sort of

10:26.380 --> 10:30.180
rant, which I don't like the end of the book because it's like some sort of he talks about

10:30.180 --> 10:35.420
like we should give women more things and I don't think we should give women more.

10:35.420 --> 10:37.220
I'm just misogynistic.

10:37.220 --> 10:44.220
But then he's like he's talking about how the predominant like if you want to get a

10:44.220 --> 10:50.340
faculty position at any sort of major university for the past 20 years it's basically all been

10:50.340 --> 10:51.340
string theory.

10:51.340 --> 10:54.580
You have to be a string theorist for some reason just and that a lot of that is because

10:54.580 --> 10:57.460
there's already string theorists in power and they're the ones that get to choose whether

10:57.460 --> 10:58.460
or not you.

10:58.460 --> 11:01.380
There's a lot of politics about it.

11:01.380 --> 11:05.900
And he's like advocating we need new ideas and we need to encourage new ideas.

11:05.900 --> 11:10.020
So I would say that that would be like the things just encouraging ideas and it doesn't

11:10.020 --> 11:11.020
have to do with the budget.

11:11.020 --> 11:17.420
It's just like the the and when you say like you have to be a string theorist to be able

11:17.420 --> 11:20.180
to get a good job.

11:20.180 --> 11:24.140
Why would you think about any other thing outside of that box?

11:24.140 --> 11:25.140
That's right.

11:25.140 --> 11:35.600
So it's a sort of systematic change or to just be like to be yeah it's a it's some sort

11:35.600 --> 11:41.240
of systematic change that needs to be done and I don't know how to do that but like or

11:41.240 --> 11:45.560
just go against the system and just just study it on your own time or and don't get paid

11:45.560 --> 11:46.560
for it.

11:46.560 --> 11:47.560
Like yeah.

11:47.560 --> 11:51.360
So if you want to get paid you should be a string theorist is basically the thing.

11:51.360 --> 11:55.400
And my brother my brother he studied string theory so I don't really know anything about

11:55.400 --> 11:56.400
string theory.

11:56.400 --> 11:57.560
He studied it.

11:57.560 --> 12:02.480
He did his PhD in it and and then he went and now he's doing mathematical finance because

12:02.480 --> 12:06.760
he left it because he he didn't like string theory because it was too disconnected from

12:06.760 --> 12:07.760
the real world.

12:07.760 --> 12:13.440
Like it was too like there's so many assumptions that you're just making that just have to

12:13.440 --> 12:18.520
be you're just assuming they're right because the equations kind of look elegant but they're

12:18.520 --> 12:19.980
not really describing a world.

12:19.980 --> 12:23.800
But then string theorists say well we're just not smart enough to sort of figure out the

12:23.800 --> 12:24.800
equations yet.

12:24.800 --> 12:25.800
They will describe our world eventually.

12:25.800 --> 12:31.320
But that's such a big there's like a thousands of people have been working on it now for

12:31.360 --> 12:36.280
like 30 years or 40 years and there's still no like big advancement.

12:36.280 --> 12:40.720
But the equations are so elegant that they're like it must be right.

12:40.720 --> 12:42.760
So he left it because of that.

12:42.760 --> 12:44.320
And now he's starting to go back.

12:44.320 --> 12:49.760
He just told me like just a couple of months ago and he said there's like been so little

12:49.760 --> 12:53.960
advancement in the past 20 like 15 years since he left it.

12:53.960 --> 12:55.060
So little change.

12:55.060 --> 13:01.200
Like even though all these really bright people are working on it like there's no new ideas.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.800
So what is the future of physics?

13:02.800 --> 13:04.840
I don't know.

13:04.840 --> 13:07.800
I'm going to be part of that though but that's secret stuff.

13:07.800 --> 13:08.800
It's secret.

13:08.800 --> 13:09.800
Yeah.

13:09.800 --> 13:10.800
Secret stuff.

13:10.800 --> 13:14.040
Well let's talk about women shouldn't have more things then.

13:14.040 --> 13:15.040
Sure.

13:15.040 --> 13:18.040
Let's talk about women.

13:18.040 --> 13:24.800
Your movie Kurt just finished the movie shooting it and editing it.

13:24.800 --> 13:27.480
And I think it's like 95 percent done overall.

13:27.480 --> 13:28.480
Yeah.

13:28.480 --> 13:30.600
And it will be screened on February 16.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.200
That's right.

13:32.200 --> 13:33.600
Where is it going to be screened?

13:33.600 --> 13:36.400
At TIFF in the evening time.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.400
So Tuesday night.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.400
It's a lovely place.

13:39.400 --> 13:40.720
It's a lovely movie.

13:40.720 --> 13:41.720
It is a lovely movie.

13:41.720 --> 13:42.720
Oh boy.

13:42.720 --> 13:44.560
I can't watch my own movie.

13:44.560 --> 13:49.200
So last the reason why I took a while to get back to you with notes on the stuff is.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.200
Yes.

13:50.200 --> 13:56.860
I'm doing I'm editing the dialogue for the film and he's talking about giving me notes

13:56.860 --> 13:59.840
about the things that a director wants to change.

13:59.840 --> 14:04.800
He directed the film written it and played in it.

14:04.800 --> 14:05.800
Yeah.

14:05.800 --> 14:10.560
And I guess I guess I guess doing a good job everybody.

14:10.560 --> 14:12.560
And when.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.960
So anyway I just like every time I have to watch my film to make notes because you have

14:15.960 --> 14:19.520
to keep watching the revisions keep watching it being like oh the sound is too loud.

14:19.520 --> 14:25.140
This not necessarily your stuff but just like object drops or whatever in the film or this

14:25.140 --> 14:26.840
needs to be paced out differently.

14:26.840 --> 14:28.800
Whatever I dread it so much.

14:28.800 --> 14:33.560
Like I'll procrastinate like crazy like I feel so I feel so embarrassed.

14:33.560 --> 14:37.360
I feel like like like my film sucks really really bad.

14:37.360 --> 14:43.640
I know this this sucks for promotion because like but but just constantly understand the

14:43.640 --> 14:44.640
feeling perfectly.

14:44.640 --> 14:45.640
Yeah.

14:45.640 --> 14:50.280
Like and there's so much dread and like I'd rather do anything else than watch it.

14:50.280 --> 14:53.760
And to the point where I even went at the premiere I didn't even want to watch it like

14:53.760 --> 14:58.040
because I was like it would just embarrass me.

14:58.040 --> 15:01.800
I'm glad people like it because they don't they don't see it the way I'm seeing it like

15:01.800 --> 15:03.640
they don't see the flaws.

15:03.640 --> 15:09.600
But to me also just like I feel like it's just I don't know I keep I keep but you see

15:09.600 --> 15:14.240
I think those are being considered flaws but you because you've already categorized them

15:14.240 --> 15:15.400
as flaws.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.160
A lot of people don't notice them.

15:17.160 --> 15:19.560
A lot of people don't consider them as flaws.

15:19.560 --> 15:21.600
So it just is.

15:21.600 --> 15:22.600
Yeah.

15:22.600 --> 15:23.600
Well yeah.

15:23.600 --> 15:27.600
The reason I'm saying I understand what you're talking about is because I had the same experience

15:27.600 --> 15:35.320
making my first album that my music album that I was playing like a guitar solo for

15:35.320 --> 15:40.000
16 hours for like a week every day.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.080
And I hated everything.

15:41.080 --> 15:42.080
I hated myself.

15:42.080 --> 15:49.520
I hated that music everything to perfect every single part of it and it will never be perfected.

15:49.520 --> 15:54.880
And I'll just learn that you had to or I had to let go at some point and like you know

15:54.880 --> 15:56.920
what this is this is cool.

15:56.960 --> 15:57.960
This is awesome.

15:57.960 --> 16:04.280
I'm going to let it go and then whatever did I learn from that experience I will apply

16:04.280 --> 16:10.200
to my next experience and whatever I learn from that my next experience to the experience

16:10.200 --> 16:11.200
after that.

16:11.200 --> 16:15.480
And that's that's how it happened to me.

16:15.480 --> 16:17.080
What sort of music?

16:17.080 --> 16:18.980
What genre?

16:18.980 --> 16:19.980
That album.

16:19.980 --> 16:20.980
Yeah.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.560
It was instrumental progressive rock jazz fusion.

16:24.560 --> 16:25.560
What is that?

16:25.560 --> 16:26.560
There's so many things.

16:26.720 --> 16:27.720
Like technical things.

16:27.720 --> 16:28.720
Technical.

16:28.720 --> 16:34.200
Is there an example of something that like you're like it's like this that I could.

16:34.200 --> 16:36.720
Do you know Dream Theater?

16:36.720 --> 16:37.720
No.

16:37.720 --> 16:38.720
Yeah.

16:38.720 --> 16:40.920
I know what those individual words mean.

16:40.920 --> 16:44.960
I don't know.

16:44.960 --> 16:48.960
I can't really think of what kind of music you listen to.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.080
I just listen to I listen to Nirvana.

16:51.080 --> 16:52.080
Yeah.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.080
Nirvana.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.080
Our Lady Pea is like the 90s rock.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.080
Yeah.

16:55.120 --> 16:56.120
Basically just those two.

16:56.120 --> 16:59.520
And then I listen to like 1950s.

16:59.520 --> 17:06.640
What kind of 1950s songs?

17:06.640 --> 17:07.640
Easy Living.

17:07.640 --> 17:08.640
Do you know Easy Living?

17:08.640 --> 17:09.640
No.

17:09.640 --> 17:10.640
Billie Holiday?

17:10.640 --> 17:11.640
Yeah.

17:11.640 --> 17:12.640
Okay.

17:12.640 --> 17:13.640
So stuff like that.

17:13.640 --> 17:20.440
Like I also like this song is like oh I'm the type of guy who never settles down for

17:20.440 --> 17:21.440
pretty girls.

17:21.440 --> 17:22.720
You know that song?

17:22.720 --> 17:23.720
Is it Elvis Presley?

17:24.160 --> 17:25.160
Oh it sounds like it.

17:25.160 --> 17:26.160
I forget what his name is.

17:26.160 --> 17:27.160
I'm a wanderer.

17:27.160 --> 17:28.160
Yeah I'm a wanderer.

17:28.160 --> 17:31.160
I roam around around.

17:31.160 --> 17:32.160
Do you know this song?

17:32.160 --> 17:33.160
No.

17:33.160 --> 17:35.160
Okay.

17:35.160 --> 17:36.160
So just I don't know.

17:36.160 --> 17:40.640
I get it from Fallout because Fallout the video game is like all sort of 1950s songs

17:40.640 --> 17:41.720
and I just liked it from that.

17:41.720 --> 17:42.720
So I don't listen to it.

17:42.720 --> 17:43.960
I actually don't listen to music.

17:43.960 --> 17:49.280
This is something like most people don't realize or think is weird about me.

17:49.280 --> 17:51.560
I never listen to music for enjoyment.

17:51.600 --> 17:55.800
I just never, I don't have music downloaded on my computer.

17:55.800 --> 17:59.080
My car speakers have never had music played out of them unless other people are hooking

17:59.080 --> 18:01.720
up their phones to it or whatever.

18:01.720 --> 18:05.920
I just, I don't listen to music for pleasure.

18:05.920 --> 18:13.560
On the set of the film, whenever that we were not shooting, Kurt was singing Nirvana songs

18:13.560 --> 18:20.320
with Kurt Cobain voice and some people liked it, some people didn't like it I guess.

18:20.360 --> 18:21.360
Who didn't like it?

18:21.360 --> 18:22.360
I don't know.

18:22.360 --> 18:27.560
I heard a couple of times that you were asked to shut the fuck up.

18:27.560 --> 18:31.240
I don't recall that at all.

18:31.240 --> 18:36.520
I recall people being happy and delighted and asking for more.

18:36.520 --> 18:39.520
What is about Nirvana?

18:39.520 --> 18:43.240
Just the song structure or you can relate to the lyrics?

18:43.240 --> 18:44.240
I don't know.

18:44.240 --> 18:46.280
Not the lyrics.

18:46.280 --> 18:49.680
I like, this is the same reason I like Our Lady Peace.

18:49.680 --> 18:50.960
I like the melody.

18:50.960 --> 18:59.560
I love sort of, I love melody in music a lot which is why I like, I actually kind of like

18:59.560 --> 19:04.720
Lady Gaga's, this cool Lady Gaga song, Bad Romance and I like the part where he goes

19:04.720 --> 19:07.480
da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.480
That's my favorite part of the song.

19:08.480 --> 19:12.760
I really, really like that part but it's like weird to like a Lady Gaga song like if you're

19:12.760 --> 19:13.760
just...

19:13.760 --> 19:14.760
It's so weird.

19:14.760 --> 19:15.760
I like Lady Gaga songs.

19:15.760 --> 19:16.760
Yeah, it's not weird.

19:16.760 --> 19:17.760
Thank you.

19:18.760 --> 19:25.520
Yeah, so I just like melody so much and I think it's melody.

19:25.520 --> 19:26.520
I think that's all it is.

19:26.520 --> 19:31.560
Like the Nirvana songs are very melodic and then Our Lady Peace's songs are melodic and

19:31.560 --> 19:34.360
I was listening and people are like, yeah, you should like Pearl Jam and stuff then if

19:34.360 --> 19:35.360
you like Nirvana.

19:35.360 --> 19:38.160
Pearl Jam stuff is not like melodic like Nirvana.

19:38.160 --> 19:45.600
It's weird and then, and I don't like when people do like, I don't know, these weird

19:45.600 --> 19:51.760
things with their, they go like, yeah, like stuff like that.

19:51.760 --> 19:54.520
Like that's not melodic and then to me that's not melodic.

19:54.520 --> 19:58.880
It's like more like sort of a vocal prowess, like showing your vocal prowess like Beyonce

19:58.880 --> 19:59.880
would or something like that.

19:59.880 --> 20:00.880
Right, show off.

20:00.880 --> 20:02.080
Yeah, but that's fine.

20:02.080 --> 20:05.760
Some people like that but I like the melody and that's not that melodic to me.

20:05.760 --> 20:11.440
Like if he did that in a melodic way, I might like it but yeah and I think that's why I

20:11.440 --> 20:12.440
like it.

20:12.480 --> 20:16.080
Another thing that I, another great book that I've been reading recently is called You're

20:16.080 --> 20:17.080
Not So Smart.

20:17.080 --> 20:18.440
Have you heard of it?

20:18.440 --> 20:19.440
You're Not So Smart, no.

20:19.440 --> 20:20.720
It's a great, great book.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.440
It's like, and each chapter is really short.

20:22.440 --> 20:29.360
It has like 60 chapters and one of those chapters talks about you, it basically goes through

20:29.360 --> 20:34.600
all sort of psychological biases you have as a human, psychological deficiencies, all

20:34.600 --> 20:35.600
these things.

20:35.600 --> 20:38.560
All these things, you think you're a rational person but here's why you're so irrational,

20:38.560 --> 20:41.160
like more irrational than you think and then they were talking about-

20:41.160 --> 20:42.160
Who's it by you now?

20:42.160 --> 20:43.160
I don't know.

20:43.160 --> 20:48.920
Then they were talking about what you think, they start off the chapter with like how you

20:48.920 --> 20:50.600
think you are and this is how you are.

20:50.600 --> 20:54.960
Like it's like you think you are, you have reasons for liking everything you do and you'll

20:54.960 --> 20:59.680
even list reasons but the truth is you don't, those reasons are in your subconscious and

20:59.680 --> 21:02.760
you don't have access to them and they are completely unrelated to what you think they

21:02.760 --> 21:03.760
are.

21:03.760 --> 21:08.520
So maybe these reasons I'm saying I like Nirvana are completely like BS, like I'm just making

21:08.520 --> 21:11.040
them up but I don't know I'm making them up.

21:11.440 --> 21:15.200
He's saying like giving examples like you think you like the song because you might

21:15.200 --> 21:18.920
say well I like the drums and blah blah blah but it turns out you like it because when

21:18.920 --> 21:23.520
you were a kid you watched this movie that had that and it was your favorite movie for

21:23.520 --> 21:28.360
whatever other reason and the ending soundtrack sounds similar to that and so years later

21:28.360 --> 21:29.360
you like that song.

21:29.360 --> 21:33.440
I agree absolutely, yeah.

21:33.440 --> 21:38.280
I think everything is like a domino, it's like one thing and this is like since the

21:38.320 --> 21:43.560
beginning of everything, if it's Big Bang, yeah exactly.

21:43.560 --> 21:54.560
So I actually don't think we have any free will in a sense that we can make a decision.

21:54.560 --> 21:59.360
First of all I think all possibilities exist like whatever decision we want to make the

21:59.360 --> 22:05.920
result of that is predetermined but we are just choosing like pathos.

22:05.920 --> 22:07.200
What do you mean by that?

22:07.240 --> 22:15.920
I mean I'm gonna go out of the house and then I get to a street that I can turn left or

22:15.920 --> 22:17.160
right.

22:17.160 --> 22:24.120
If I turn left series of things will happen like bird will fly over, wind will blow that

22:24.120 --> 22:26.680
leaf, a car will pass by.

22:26.680 --> 22:29.520
If I go right different things will happen.

22:29.520 --> 22:33.160
What I'm saying is that left and right is already predetermined but I'm choosing if

22:33.160 --> 22:35.680
I'm going left or right.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.320
That's as much free will as I have.

22:37.320 --> 22:39.000
Oh I see what you're saying.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
That's my understanding.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
What do you think?

22:41.000 --> 22:43.440
I don't even believe that.

22:43.440 --> 22:45.280
I believe in the gist of what you're saying.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.920
So I do believe we don't have free will.

22:47.920 --> 22:52.320
The universe is not deterministic, it can't be, which I can explain why, because of quantum

22:52.320 --> 22:54.240
mechanics, just because of quantum mechanics, because of randomness.

22:54.240 --> 22:57.640
So it's not determined but that doesn't have anything to do with free will.

22:57.640 --> 22:58.640
Maybe it doesn't.

22:58.640 --> 23:01.120
I'm not saying it's determined in a sense that...

23:01.120 --> 23:04.440
Like from the single moment of Big Bang we can determine all future events.

23:04.440 --> 23:05.440
Yes.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.080
But all possibilities exist.

23:09.080 --> 23:10.080
That's what I think.

23:10.080 --> 23:11.080
What do you mean by that?

23:11.080 --> 23:17.160
It means that everything that can happen, like alternate universes.

23:17.160 --> 23:21.920
If I'm turning left here, one of me in one alternate universe will turn right.

23:21.920 --> 23:23.640
You believe in the multiverse.

23:23.640 --> 23:26.480
I don't know if multiverse will explain that.

23:26.480 --> 23:30.040
Multiverse is the only thing that I can explain this what I think with now.

23:30.040 --> 23:31.040
Okay.

23:31.040 --> 23:32.040
Yeah.

23:32.040 --> 23:36.280
I think everything exists and we are just taking different paths.

23:36.280 --> 23:41.000
That path already exists but it's not predetermined that we're going to take that path.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
Interesting.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
Okay.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.840
That decision that we're making at that point is a reaction to another action which by itself

23:46.840 --> 23:47.840
is a reaction to another action.

23:47.840 --> 23:48.840
Yeah.

23:48.840 --> 23:49.840
I agree with that.

23:49.840 --> 23:54.800
And I don't even think it's only about us and like me and you, we're talking and we

23:54.800 --> 23:58.280
are affecting each other's train of thought.

23:58.280 --> 23:59.280
Yeah.

23:59.640 --> 24:02.480
We are also affected by the elements.

24:02.480 --> 24:04.160
So everything is like this.

24:04.160 --> 24:09.040
So we just have to write it and observe and understand things.

24:09.040 --> 24:14.440
I think more and more to understand that everything is connected, we're just going with the flow

24:14.440 --> 24:16.240
is like a drop in the ocean.

24:16.240 --> 24:17.240
That's what I think.

24:17.240 --> 24:23.560
You ever hear this thing about the only thing you can know for sure is that you're the only

24:23.560 --> 24:25.320
thing that's conscious or whatever?

24:25.320 --> 24:26.320
Right.

24:26.440 --> 24:31.000
That to me, that is one of the dumbest things I've ever heard and they'll tell you why.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Yeah.

24:32.000 --> 24:40.640
It's true but then why, if that was true and I was the only conscious thing or that person

24:40.640 --> 24:44.960
who wrote it was the only conscious thing and she or he, I think it's a she just because

24:44.960 --> 24:47.480
my hatred for this person.

24:47.480 --> 24:49.960
So she wrote this thing.

24:49.960 --> 24:50.960
Why would you even write it?

24:50.960 --> 24:55.560
Why would you spend the tens and hundreds of hours to write this whole thesis statement

24:55.560 --> 25:02.000
about why you are the only one that really exists or that you can know for sure exists?

25:02.000 --> 25:04.440
If you really believe that, why bother?

25:04.440 --> 25:07.360
Why not just not do anything or murder people?

25:07.360 --> 25:08.360
Obviously it's not true.

25:08.360 --> 25:13.120
If you ask anybody who knows that, they would say or they would just say they don't believe

25:13.120 --> 25:17.320
that because otherwise you would live your life completely differently if you really

25:17.320 --> 25:18.320
thought that was true.

25:18.320 --> 25:24.200
I know theoretically or whatever if you're talking about like in terms of experience,

25:24.200 --> 25:27.320
you can only talk about your own experience.

25:27.320 --> 25:28.960
Like that's the only thing you could say is true.

25:28.960 --> 25:34.000
Everybody else could be a robot but it's just one of the dumbest sort of arguments that

25:34.000 --> 25:36.400
someone makes that's trying to sound intellectual.

25:36.400 --> 25:40.080
Like I just hate that argument so much.

25:40.080 --> 25:43.160
It's just if it was true, why would you do it?

25:43.160 --> 25:44.160
Why would you even say it?

25:44.160 --> 25:46.480
Like what's the point of even doing anything?

25:46.480 --> 25:50.560
I don't know if there is any point overall.

25:50.560 --> 25:59.560
The point is probably to not die of hunger and be somewhere warm, you know?

25:59.560 --> 26:08.480
But then we have imagination and we have the tool to make it happen so we make things.

26:08.480 --> 26:14.600
But what I'm saying is that we don't have any control over decisions individually because...

26:14.600 --> 26:20.200
So let's say that thing was true, that thing that conscious being thing was true.

26:20.200 --> 26:23.160
Like you only know that you're the only conscious being.

26:23.160 --> 26:26.320
So then if it's true, then that means that I'm the only conscious being because right

26:26.320 --> 26:28.360
now I'm the only one experiencing myself right now.

26:28.360 --> 26:31.120
So I feel like I'm the only one that's living, really.

26:31.120 --> 26:38.980
Well they really say in a conversation between two people, there are multiple of us exist.

26:38.980 --> 26:41.080
One of me is who I think I am.

26:41.080 --> 26:43.960
One of me is who you think I am.

26:43.960 --> 26:51.840
Which is completely different from me, but that's how you categorize aga in your mind.

26:51.840 --> 26:54.640
And one version is who I really am.

26:54.640 --> 26:58.580
Who are you aga?

26:58.580 --> 27:00.160
You tell me.

27:00.160 --> 27:05.840
You just made this argument about how I can't, that there is an alternate aga.

27:05.840 --> 27:08.800
I think there is alternate of everything.

27:08.800 --> 27:10.000
Who you think you are.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.480
Let's probe into this one particular alternate thing.

27:13.480 --> 27:15.360
Who are you?

27:15.360 --> 27:18.520
What's something about you that I don't know?

27:18.520 --> 27:24.720
Nothing like trivial, like you like orange socks or something strange.

27:24.720 --> 27:31.000
I don't give a fuck about overall.

27:31.000 --> 27:38.040
I think it just, you make things and you make you enjoy the result for most people, but

27:38.040 --> 27:41.280
the point is to be able to enjoy the process of making them.

27:41.320 --> 27:42.720
Do you ever have regret?

27:42.720 --> 27:43.720
Huh?

27:43.720 --> 27:45.520
Do you ever have regret?

27:45.520 --> 27:47.560
I don't believe in regret.

27:47.560 --> 27:49.080
I don't think it's logical.

27:49.080 --> 27:54.480
I know, but we're just, you know, irrational or logical beings, so I want to know if you

27:54.480 --> 27:55.480
can...

27:55.480 --> 27:57.240
Well, we don't have to.

27:57.240 --> 27:58.880
We don't have to be irrational or logical.

27:58.880 --> 28:02.820
Oh, but you're not so smart books, Differ is, begs to differ.

28:02.820 --> 28:05.200
You should read that book, it's a great book by the way.

28:05.200 --> 28:09.440
Anyway, so obviously like I don't believe in a, like there's lots of things you can

28:09.440 --> 28:10.620
logically know.

28:10.620 --> 28:17.380
I think regret comes from judging a event in the past with our present knowledge and

28:17.380 --> 28:20.260
wisdom and in hindsight.

28:20.260 --> 28:25.900
But I can also equally say that the opposite of regret, which is like, um, whatever acceptance

28:25.900 --> 28:32.820
maybe, if regret is irrational, why is acceptance not irrational?

28:32.820 --> 28:34.500
That is also irrational.

28:34.500 --> 28:36.620
So what, what is the most, what do you do?

28:36.620 --> 28:37.620
How do you, what do you do?

28:37.740 --> 28:41.300
Do you just sit there in the state of like, of just like, just, you just...

28:41.300 --> 28:43.300
No, because I have to survive.

28:43.300 --> 28:44.660
That's the thing.

28:44.660 --> 28:45.660
I have to survive.

28:45.660 --> 28:46.660
I have to eat.

28:46.660 --> 28:48.500
I have to drink water.

28:48.500 --> 28:59.420
But my point is, it's very Buddhist, I guess, is like that I should be fine with being in

28:59.420 --> 29:07.860
that room that you're saying completely empty or being in, in the middle of, you know, a

29:07.860 --> 29:08.860
palace.

29:08.860 --> 29:15.980
Like, I knew I'm limited to pretty much one room, doesn't matter where I live because

29:15.980 --> 29:16.980
that's how I grew up.

29:16.980 --> 29:18.980
What do you mean?

29:18.980 --> 29:19.980
I was always in my room.

29:19.980 --> 29:22.980
Oh, this was just a metaphoric, I was just joking.

29:22.980 --> 29:26.260
I didn't literally mean, are you going to be in a room?

29:26.260 --> 29:29.260
You could be.

29:29.500 --> 29:30.500
And I could be.

29:30.500 --> 29:31.780
So when you say like, you know...

29:31.780 --> 29:39.380
But what I'm saying is that we are, we, there is nothing objective about what we're experiencing.

29:39.380 --> 29:41.020
It's a complete subjective experience.

29:41.020 --> 29:44.300
So the reality that you're experiencing is a very different reality than I'm experiencing

29:44.300 --> 29:45.300
everybody else's.

29:45.300 --> 29:46.300
Yeah.

29:46.300 --> 29:49.980
No, but what I'm, I agree with that, but what I'm talking about is like, you said you don't

29:49.980 --> 29:58.100
give a fuck, which I believe you, but I want to know, so you don't really, I want to know

29:58.100 --> 29:59.100
if you experience regret.

29:59.100 --> 30:02.700
I know you don't think it's rational, but that's a different thing entirely.

30:02.700 --> 30:04.700
Whether or not you experience regret or whether or not you think...

30:04.700 --> 30:05.700
Sometimes I do.

30:05.700 --> 30:06.700
Yeah.

30:06.700 --> 30:11.700
So you give, you basically, you do give a fuck, but just way less than most people.

30:11.700 --> 30:16.300
I think it's just a matter of discipline and practice to get to a point that you can't

30:16.300 --> 30:20.900
change your past and you're building your future right now.

30:20.900 --> 30:25.840
So the best thing to do is to focus on right now, whatever it is that's happening.

30:25.840 --> 30:37.360
So for me, I want to be the most observant and present in the moment that I can be to

30:37.360 --> 30:41.000
experience that.

30:41.000 --> 30:46.340
Does that, and does that bring you happiness?

30:46.340 --> 30:47.340
What is happiness?

30:47.340 --> 30:49.240
No, that's, that's why I'm asking you like...

30:49.240 --> 30:53.600
Well, you should define happiness.

30:53.600 --> 30:56.560
What do you define happiness as?

30:56.560 --> 31:04.400
I define happiness as healthy, being healthy, being fulfilled and being successful.

31:04.400 --> 31:05.400
Okay.

31:05.400 --> 31:06.400
But...

31:06.400 --> 31:08.600
Let's get rid of the successful part.

31:08.600 --> 31:09.600
Let's say...

31:09.600 --> 31:12.360
Successful, it doesn't necessarily relate to money.

31:12.360 --> 31:13.360
No, I know.

31:13.360 --> 31:14.360
Material success.

31:14.360 --> 31:15.360
No, of course, of course.

31:15.360 --> 31:17.080
But I, so let's say the fulfillment thing.

31:17.080 --> 31:18.080
So do you feel...

31:18.080 --> 31:19.080
All right, fine.

31:19.080 --> 31:20.080
Put in successful.

31:21.080 --> 31:22.080
Do you feel happy?

31:22.080 --> 31:24.240
You're whatever your definition of happy is.

31:24.240 --> 31:25.240
Fuck yeah.

31:25.240 --> 31:30.880
I think I'm the fucking luckiest person that I know.

31:30.880 --> 31:32.440
Good.

31:32.440 --> 31:33.960
And I'm an atheist.

31:33.960 --> 31:38.220
So I don't have God to thank to.

31:38.220 --> 31:44.720
And I found out that saying thank you universe is also that fucking same bullshit.

31:44.720 --> 31:47.020
Yeah, who says thank you universe?

31:47.020 --> 31:48.440
Some people do.

31:49.000 --> 31:55.840
They want to replace God with something else, but it's the same fucking nonsense.

31:55.840 --> 31:57.840
So I'm just happy.

31:57.840 --> 32:03.240
There's this girl on my Facebook feed that like, I just, I met her at Starbucks.

32:03.240 --> 32:08.120
She, I don't know, she looked like a normal person.

32:08.120 --> 32:11.120
And then, and then we just exchanged Facebook contact.

32:11.120 --> 32:15.440
And I see her, the stuff that she posts on Facebook, it's all, she's always like, she

32:15.640 --> 32:19.360
puts these vlogs that like three people see, but she talks like she's, she acts like she's

32:19.360 --> 32:22.680
talking to like thousands or she has like a cult following.

32:22.680 --> 32:24.880
She's like, she's like, Hey everybody.

32:24.880 --> 32:26.240
Oh my God.

32:26.240 --> 32:27.820
It's such a beautiful day.

32:27.820 --> 32:29.520
Don't you just like shut your mouth.

32:29.520 --> 32:33.520
And she, and she talks about like, like you should like go on a cleanse.

32:33.520 --> 32:36.520
Like I just went on a, a yoga retreat.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.800
Who goes fuck you on a fucking yoga retreat.

32:38.800 --> 32:40.520
I hate her so much.

32:40.520 --> 32:45.040
And I keep her as my friend because it aggravates me sometimes like, you know, some people,

32:45.040 --> 32:49.080
they go to Reddit, like they browse R funny, R slash funny or whatever, to like make themselves

32:49.080 --> 32:50.080
feel good.

32:50.080 --> 32:54.280
Sometimes I'll, I'll browse things to make myself feel bad just cause I'm a weirdo.

32:54.280 --> 32:58.200
And so, so whenever I want to feel like hatred, I'll just, I'll look at her Facebook feed.

32:58.200 --> 33:06.600
It's like all about like, there's, there's toxins in like, like in like the, like the

33:06.600 --> 33:12.740
government is, is a toxin, not, not that that's actually like another thing.

33:12.740 --> 33:16.900
The government puts toxins in your, just like, oh, fucking bullshit.

33:16.900 --> 33:19.880
Well, people are looking for a purpose now.

33:19.880 --> 33:21.300
It's bullshit purpose.

33:21.300 --> 33:24.100
Yeah, but she's, she just sucks as a person.

33:24.100 --> 33:25.460
A lot of people did.

33:25.460 --> 33:28.900
Yeah, but she in particular, she broadcasts it.

33:28.900 --> 33:33.980
She broadcasts it with such confidence and such sincerity to convince herself that she's

33:33.980 --> 33:34.980
a good person.

33:34.980 --> 33:36.420
No, she, she's already done that.

33:36.420 --> 33:38.680
She's done that a long time ago.

33:39.560 --> 33:45.680
And she also has like really like, she's also not even that fit, but she keeps talking about

33:45.680 --> 33:47.280
how she's so fit.

33:47.280 --> 33:48.680
She needs to lose some weight.

33:48.680 --> 33:53.660
She needs to like you, like she needs to, she's, she's not a good person.

33:53.660 --> 33:54.660
She bothers me so much.

33:54.660 --> 33:58.380
I wish I could say her name.

33:58.380 --> 34:04.460
I once posted something, oh, oh, oh, she also, we just never, I just added her and then we

34:04.460 --> 34:05.540
never talked, right?

34:05.540 --> 34:08.460
So she doesn't even know who I am anymore because it's been so long, right?

34:08.460 --> 34:10.860
Why did you add her as a first place?

34:10.860 --> 34:11.860
This was like two years ago.

34:11.860 --> 34:12.860
But why?

34:12.860 --> 34:13.860
Why?

34:13.860 --> 34:14.860
I don't know.

34:14.860 --> 34:15.860
I was just adding everybody at that time.

34:15.860 --> 34:16.860
No, I was not, not everybody.

34:16.860 --> 34:18.820
I was just adding, cause she was a woman, she was a girl.

34:18.820 --> 34:20.820
So I was like, okay, maybe I could sleep with her.

34:20.820 --> 34:21.820
Yeah.

34:21.820 --> 34:22.820
Did you?

34:22.820 --> 34:23.820
No.

34:23.820 --> 34:27.220
I'm at her vagina is probably like, probably like she probably doesn't, I don't know.

34:27.220 --> 34:28.980
She probably does weird things to it with like.

34:28.980 --> 34:29.980
Like what?

34:29.980 --> 34:36.860
It's like one of those things that you take where you dilute it in water so many times.

34:36.860 --> 34:38.020
What's that thing?

34:38.020 --> 34:39.020
What's that thing called?

34:39.020 --> 34:43.420
Where you dilute it in water and then homeopathic, she probably does homeopathic solutions for

34:43.420 --> 34:46.900
her real yeast infection and it's just not going away.

34:46.900 --> 34:49.900
She's like, no, it's working.

34:49.900 --> 34:51.140
I can feel it.

34:51.140 --> 34:56.780
Is this a, is this a hatred towards women or you're just very critical of them?

34:56.780 --> 35:00.740
Cause it's kind of a pattern that can be also seen in your film.

35:00.740 --> 35:02.540
Oh, seriously?

35:02.540 --> 35:03.540
Yeah.

35:03.540 --> 35:09.740
So, well, tell me this first, is your film, how would you categorize that?

35:09.740 --> 35:14.060
Is comedy, philosophical, romantic?

35:14.060 --> 35:16.020
Oh, very interesting.

35:16.020 --> 35:21.260
So, so there's so much, something that's really, something that I wanted to do is like, whatever

35:21.860 --> 35:26.860
I write, I write it for, I want it to be like the best thing that I could possibly write

35:26.860 --> 35:32.180
at the time and I'm not going to dumb it down for anybody.

35:32.180 --> 35:39.540
So there's a lot of stuff in there that's like sort of weird and esoteric and it's like,

35:39.540 --> 35:41.460
also then, then I also, here's another thing.

35:41.460 --> 35:44.900
Just like that girl where she has three followers, but she acts like she has a thousand, I'm

35:44.900 --> 35:47.620
criticizing her, but I kind of do the same thing with my film.

35:47.620 --> 35:55.540
Like I, I, I put so many things in there that you really have to be so observant to realize.

35:55.540 --> 35:59.620
Like you have to watch the film three times to be like, oh, that sentence means this.

35:59.620 --> 36:02.300
Oh, that implies there's another layer underneath.

36:02.300 --> 36:06.780
And then, and then I put like, for those people that figure that out, for the hardcore fans,

36:06.780 --> 36:10.620
like you can be like, oh, there's another layer underneath that.

36:10.620 --> 36:13.440
And then, and then even one more that like no one will figure out until like ask them

36:13.440 --> 36:17.500
one specific question, like, oh, well, why do you think this character did this?

36:17.500 --> 36:19.620
And then they'd be like, holy shit.

36:19.620 --> 36:22.100
And then they inspire you to start writing.

36:22.100 --> 36:27.220
What did you get inspired to get into movies?

36:27.220 --> 36:37.540
I used to do standup and it was just, I just wanted to do something like, you know, everybody

36:37.540 --> 36:38.740
wants to do movies.

36:38.740 --> 36:43.260
Everybody like, everybody says that, oh, I have a story or whatever they, so it's like

36:43.260 --> 36:46.380
in our culture to just like want to do movies and I was already doing standup.

36:46.380 --> 36:49.300
So then I was like, okay, I can write it.

36:49.300 --> 36:55.300
Then I, the real story is like I made a script for Comedy Central when I just did one performance.

36:55.300 --> 37:00.180
All I did was one performance on stage and I did pretty good.

37:00.180 --> 37:01.580
And I just thought it was like the best.

37:01.580 --> 37:06.980
So I wrote a script for Comedy Central after one performance on stage and it sucked so

37:06.980 --> 37:08.460
bad and they rejected it.

37:08.460 --> 37:12.980
And then I was just like, I just, instead of me being like, fuck, what the fuck, man,

37:12.980 --> 37:13.980
I suck.

37:14.100 --> 37:17.380
Instead of me being like that, which I normally would, I don't know why it wasn't, I was just

37:17.380 --> 37:20.060
like, who are they to reject my amazing script?

37:20.060 --> 37:22.700
I was like, such overconfidence about it.

37:22.700 --> 37:23.700
And the script, by the way-

37:23.700 --> 37:24.700
How long ago was that?

37:24.700 --> 37:27.180
This was like when I was 18.

37:27.180 --> 37:29.180
How old are you now?

37:29.180 --> 37:30.180
27.

37:30.180 --> 37:32.380
So nine years ago, yeah.

37:32.380 --> 37:36.780
So then I just like learned, I was like, fine, I'll make my own script, learned to use a

37:36.780 --> 37:37.780
camera.

37:37.780 --> 37:40.340
Then I wanted to get a director and no one would direct it, like I didn't know how to

37:40.340 --> 37:41.340
get a director.

37:41.340 --> 37:42.340
I'm like, fine, I'll learn to direct.

37:42.340 --> 37:44.460
I'll be my own director.

37:44.460 --> 37:45.460
Wanted to get someone to edit.

37:45.460 --> 37:46.460
I'm like, no one will.

37:46.460 --> 37:48.340
Fine, I'll learn to edit it myself.

37:48.340 --> 37:51.260
Then it just kind of went that way of like people saying no, then I was like, fine, I'll

37:51.260 --> 37:52.460
do it anyway.

37:52.460 --> 37:58.180
And then so it just kind of came about from doing a bunch of those little comedy things

37:58.180 --> 37:59.180
or little-

37:59.180 --> 38:00.180
It's awesome.

38:00.180 --> 38:01.180
Videos, yeah.

38:01.180 --> 38:05.300
Is this story based on something that happened to you personally?

38:05.300 --> 38:08.380
All of it is like, almost all of it is real.

38:08.380 --> 38:11.220
Yeah, very, very little of it is not real.

38:11.220 --> 38:15.740
Like almost everything is a storyline that really happened, except obviously Japiness,

38:15.740 --> 38:21.100
which is a story that there's no real, there's a story in the film, the character gets, wants

38:21.100 --> 38:24.860
to make a story for Japanese people and then he's-

38:24.860 --> 38:27.780
It's not racist, it's cultural awareness.

38:27.780 --> 38:28.780
Yeah.

38:28.780 --> 38:30.620
And then it's just-

38:30.620 --> 38:31.620
It's pretty good.

38:31.620 --> 38:35.740
Yeah, then that's fake, obviously.

38:35.740 --> 38:39.340
You were influenced by Larry David, clearly.

38:39.340 --> 38:40.340
Yeah.

38:40.340 --> 38:41.700
Did he yell into you or no?

38:41.700 --> 38:45.900
Not really, but someone said that, someone said Wes Anderson, which I really disagree

38:45.900 --> 38:46.900
with.

38:46.900 --> 38:47.900
I don't even like Wes Anderson.

38:47.900 --> 38:51.500
I watched his films like once each, not even twice.

38:51.500 --> 38:52.900
Which ones did you watch?

38:52.900 --> 38:59.420
So I watched Bottle Rocket, which I think is the one that I like the most.

38:59.420 --> 39:02.700
And I really, oh, I like Mr. The Fantastic Fox, something like that.

39:02.700 --> 39:05.540
I really like that one.

39:05.540 --> 39:09.340
And then the rest I don't really like, like Darjeeling Unlimited or whatever.

39:09.340 --> 39:10.940
Oh no, I love that film.

39:10.940 --> 39:16.340
Yeah, so I didn't really like it, but then what else?

39:16.340 --> 39:22.340
His most recent ones I didn't like, the past three, Hotels, no the Hotel Chavalier was

39:22.340 --> 39:24.060
a short film I think.

39:24.060 --> 39:26.380
Yeah, that's a short film.

39:26.380 --> 39:31.980
That one I really totally liked though, that one I liked, and that wasn't comedic at all.

39:31.980 --> 39:32.980
Yeah.

39:32.980 --> 39:37.380
Yeah, so it was strange that people said it was Wes Anderson, it's only because I love

39:37.380 --> 39:39.300
like straight-ons of people.

39:39.300 --> 39:43.620
I love straight-ons, and just for people who aren't into film, that just means you film

39:43.620 --> 39:47.380
a character straight-on and not at an angle, like they're looking almost at the barrel

39:47.380 --> 39:48.380
of the lens.

39:48.380 --> 39:49.740
I love that.

39:49.740 --> 39:54.900
And I guess Wes Anderson does that too, so that's pretty much the only, maybe Whip Pans.

39:54.900 --> 39:59.260
Maybe that and Whip Pans is the, but for me, I wrote that in the script, like I wasn't

39:59.260 --> 40:06.660
even thinking Wes Anderson, I just, that was just a better scene transition than a cut.

40:06.660 --> 40:09.060
It just, it flowed better.

40:09.060 --> 40:14.300
Like I could see it while I was writing it, that if it was a cut, it would be 5% different

40:14.300 --> 40:17.180
in terms of the emotion that I wanted to evoke.

40:17.180 --> 40:18.660
So I was like, okay, I can make it.

40:18.660 --> 40:21.500
How do you define people, like actors especially?

40:21.500 --> 40:22.500
Mandy.

40:22.500 --> 40:25.300
Just Mandy, that's it.

40:25.300 --> 40:29.380
A little bit through this website called My Goalio, which is this new website.

40:29.380 --> 40:35.020
And then you went by faces for actors or did they audition for it and you were like, okay,

40:35.020 --> 40:37.180
not you, not you, not you, you, yes.

40:37.180 --> 40:38.180
Yeah.

40:38.180 --> 40:39.180
It was like Tinder.

40:39.180 --> 40:43.060
It was like swiping on Tinder, especially for the women, because there's, but not because

40:43.060 --> 40:45.020
I'm just going for who looks good.

40:45.020 --> 40:49.380
I'm just going for like who looks like the role that I, like you have to, first, the

40:49.380 --> 40:53.100
first filter is you have to look like the person that I want you to look like.

40:53.100 --> 40:55.660
And then the second thing is like, then you have to act it.

40:55.660 --> 41:01.140
So I could eliminate a lot of the people just by like swiping left or archiving or whatever.

41:01.140 --> 41:02.140
Yeah.

41:02.140 --> 41:05.300
And same with the guys too.

41:05.300 --> 41:07.580
How long was the process?

41:07.580 --> 41:12.780
Pre-production started two weeks before production, like it was so hectic, man.

41:12.780 --> 41:16.100
And we were doing pre-production while we're doing production too.

41:16.100 --> 41:24.020
In fact, the guy who played the lead role, Hanny, the second lead, it was going to be

41:24.020 --> 41:26.660
someone completely different than his schedule changed.

41:26.660 --> 41:28.380
And he was the most ideal person.

41:28.380 --> 41:31.980
And then he was quoting me some crazy amount of money that he wanted.

41:31.980 --> 41:35.900
And then it was like just per day, even if it was one hour, but it was a crazy amount,

41:35.900 --> 41:40.900
like more money than my cinematographer is being paid, more money than like even my cinematographer

41:40.900 --> 41:43.820
and producer together are being paid.

41:43.820 --> 41:44.820
And he's not even that good.

41:44.820 --> 41:46.940
He's not like, I don't know why he wanted that.

41:46.940 --> 41:50.340
I think he was doing that as a way to get out, but whatever.

41:50.340 --> 41:52.620
So I couldn't get him.

41:52.620 --> 41:54.460
And then he wouldn't even guarantee me dates.

41:54.460 --> 41:57.180
So I'm like, I was thinking like, if I'm going to pay you that much, you better say that

41:57.180 --> 42:00.980
you're free on the dates that I want you to be free if I'm telling you in advance.

42:00.980 --> 42:03.260
And he's like, no, I can't do those dates.

42:03.260 --> 42:10.460
But anyway, so then we got Hanny, the guy who played his name, Sean Ray, and this is

42:10.460 --> 42:11.460
not good.

42:11.460 --> 42:17.580
Sean Ray wouldn't want to hear this, but like he was like our, we were just like, I personally

42:17.580 --> 42:19.540
was like, fuck it, fine.

42:19.540 --> 42:20.540
We'll just get this guy.

42:20.540 --> 42:22.540
Like seriously, I feel so bad.

42:22.540 --> 42:23.740
He did a really good job though.

42:23.740 --> 42:28.740
No, he did a great job, but like at the time when I watched his audition, I was watching

42:28.740 --> 42:29.740
a bunch of auditions.

42:30.500 --> 42:35.060
The whole theme of the script, the whole theme of the movie after a while became fuck it,

42:35.060 --> 42:36.060
whatever.

42:36.060 --> 42:39.940
Like for every little decision, like certain things would start to go wrong and or like

42:39.940 --> 42:44.540
you just never ideal, then you just say fuck it, whatever, just move on.

42:44.540 --> 42:48.660
Even to this, to the supporting lead, like we're watching the auditions, he, he sucked

42:48.660 --> 42:49.660
the least.

42:49.660 --> 42:53.340
I was like, ah, fuck it, we'll just cast him.

42:53.340 --> 42:54.340
So we got him to come in.

42:54.340 --> 42:58.360
I told him it was an audition and it was, but we set up lights and everything.

42:58.360 --> 43:02.640
We set up the whole scene with the fog machine, with the labs, with everything so that we

43:02.640 --> 43:06.960
could film it at the same time so that if it did work, we could put it in the film.

43:06.960 --> 43:10.720
And then that scene ended up going in the film.

43:10.720 --> 43:14.280
It was the one where he had to ADR because that was one with the dialogue that was the

43:14.280 --> 43:15.280
worst.

43:15.280 --> 43:16.280
Yeah.

43:16.280 --> 43:18.760
But no, he ended up being really good.

43:18.760 --> 43:19.960
I didn't want him to do the accent.

43:19.960 --> 43:23.160
I first, I put that in the script and then I thought the accent was too silly and I didn't

43:23.160 --> 43:24.640
want that in the movie.

43:24.640 --> 43:29.040
But then Khan and Jess and the, and someone else that was there just said like, no, the

43:29.040 --> 43:30.040
accent's good.

43:30.040 --> 43:31.040
The accent's good.

43:31.040 --> 43:32.040
I'm like, whatever.

43:32.040 --> 43:35.240
We did multiple takes with the accent without, for that one scene.

43:35.240 --> 43:39.080
And then I was like, okay, fine, we'll, we'll put the accent in and everybody loved him

43:39.080 --> 43:40.080
a lot.

43:40.080 --> 43:41.080
Yeah.

43:41.080 --> 43:42.080
Like people were surprised he doesn't even have that accent.

43:42.080 --> 43:44.680
No, he's doing a really good job.

43:44.680 --> 43:46.680
Yeah, he's the, he's the best actor.

43:46.680 --> 43:48.100
I'm the worst actor.

43:48.100 --> 43:50.280
And then it goes, I have, I'm pretty bad.

43:50.280 --> 43:51.600
I don't think you're too bad.

43:51.600 --> 43:52.600
I'm like cracking.

43:52.600 --> 43:54.200
I'm like laughing at certain scenes.

43:54.200 --> 43:56.240
It was, it was, I was okay.

43:56.240 --> 43:57.240
Fine.

43:57.240 --> 43:58.240
I was okay.

43:58.240 --> 44:01.240
I was better than the, I don't want to say the other people that weren't that good, but

44:01.240 --> 44:02.240
yeah.

44:02.240 --> 44:03.240
Do you have the second movie planned?

44:03.240 --> 44:04.240
I do.

44:04.240 --> 44:05.240
Yeah.

44:05.240 --> 44:06.240
What's that?

44:06.240 --> 44:08.760
So, so that one's going to be a big, big movie.

44:08.760 --> 44:10.200
I can talk about that later.

44:10.200 --> 44:11.200
I can't talk about things.

44:11.200 --> 44:12.200
It's not that planned.

44:12.200 --> 44:18.840
That's why it's very in its infancy, but it's going to be, it's going to be like, I keep

44:19.320 --> 44:25.880
But it's going to be considered to be one of the greatest movies ever made.

44:25.880 --> 44:27.200
And people are like, oh yeah, sure.

44:27.200 --> 44:28.200
Well, that's good.

44:28.200 --> 44:29.200
You're shamed for that.

44:29.200 --> 44:31.760
That's like how people think it, but I'm, I'm serious.

44:31.760 --> 44:34.360
Like it's going to be that good.

44:34.360 --> 44:40.080
Like we know how there's the standard top 100, which is like Citizen Kane, Godfather,

44:40.080 --> 44:43.400
I don't know, Shawshank maybe.

44:43.400 --> 44:44.400
It's going to be up there.

44:44.400 --> 44:48.080
It's like, it will almost, it's going to be good.

44:48.120 --> 44:49.600
My next one's going to be amazing.

44:49.600 --> 44:53.080
Then my third one, I have that one kind of planned.

44:53.080 --> 44:56.520
That one is not going to be in terms of, it's going to be good.

44:56.520 --> 44:57.520
It's going to be great.

44:57.520 --> 45:00.880
To me, it'll be even better than my second, but it won't be considered by critics and

45:00.880 --> 45:05.800
stuff to be like the top 100, but that one will change people's lives.

45:05.800 --> 45:11.040
Like my third one is like one that will like make you be like, oh, like rethink a lot of

45:11.040 --> 45:12.040
stuff.

45:12.040 --> 45:15.640
That one's, my third one's a very thought provoking one.

45:15.640 --> 45:16.640
Interesting.

45:16.640 --> 45:17.640
Yeah.

45:18.320 --> 45:21.440
Have you started a process of writing a script for both of them at the same time?

45:21.440 --> 45:22.440
No.

45:22.440 --> 45:25.600
I just have the idea for the third one and I kind of have the idea for the second one

45:25.600 --> 45:27.120
that I'm writing still.

45:27.120 --> 45:28.120
Yeah.

45:28.120 --> 45:34.840
You mentioned that you have a special kind of passion for Toronto and you want to do

45:34.840 --> 45:41.160
with Toronto what Woody Allen did with New York.

45:41.160 --> 45:45.880
What makes you so interested in Toronto and are your future movies also going to be in

45:45.880 --> 45:48.480
Toronto and all your movies are going to be in Toronto?

45:48.480 --> 45:52.240
At least the next two, right, because I haven't planned and I have something interesting planned

45:52.240 --> 45:54.360
for how I'm going to do my second one about Toronto.

45:54.360 --> 45:59.000
It's going to almost be like, not CG, but like it's going to be a changed, it's a Toronto

45:59.000 --> 46:05.080
you haven't seen, like a very tweaked Toronto, kind of like her, like slightly futuristic,

46:05.080 --> 46:09.600
but it's not really, it's not a future in this movie.

46:09.600 --> 46:14.360
It's not like a science fiction, so her is like kind of fantasy in the future.

46:14.360 --> 46:21.240
This is not that, but anyway, yeah, it's going to be in Toronto and the reason why, I don't

46:21.240 --> 46:23.800
know, I have an irrational love for Toronto.

46:23.800 --> 46:28.960
It's irrational, just like you're not so smart tells me in the book, but really I have no

46:28.960 --> 46:32.640
reason to love the city that much other than it's the first world country, which is great

46:32.640 --> 46:38.560
and like I always, I constantly tell people, people ask me like, what's something you do

46:38.560 --> 46:39.560
for fun?

46:39.600 --> 46:46.320
And something I love to do is like just walk around downtown at night with just the streetlights

46:46.320 --> 46:47.320
and just everything.

46:47.320 --> 46:53.000
Like I feel, there's like this childlike sort of like, I feel so happy, so like content

46:53.000 --> 46:57.920
and happy and like, and grateful, I'm like, look at all these things we have that everybody's

46:57.920 --> 47:02.160
just walking past and they don't even care about, but like we have like paved, first

47:02.160 --> 47:05.800
of all, we have paved roads and not just like any paved, they're great, they're like normal

47:05.920 --> 47:12.560
roads, they're not like Trinidad roads in my country.

47:12.560 --> 47:16.440
So they're great, we have clean water, anytime we want, we can just get clean water.

47:16.440 --> 47:18.360
We don't even have to, we can go to a store and it's...

47:18.360 --> 47:22.320
Clean water apparently is not the case across Canada, but it is in Toronto definitely.

47:22.320 --> 47:24.320
Sure, okay, so let's say Toronto, yeah.

47:24.320 --> 47:26.440
So that's what I'm saying, like how good we have it here.

47:26.440 --> 47:27.440
So clean water.

47:27.440 --> 47:29.560
Oh, this is like heaven.

47:29.560 --> 47:31.200
It's amazing, like the worst...

47:31.200 --> 47:33.080
Not like heaven, this is heaven.

47:33.160 --> 47:38.960
Like a homeless person here has it better than like the average Nigerian or whatever,

47:38.960 --> 47:39.960
so choose something.

47:39.960 --> 47:42.880
Yeah, like 90% population of the world probably.

47:42.880 --> 47:48.640
Yeah, so it's really cool and people are so, they don't really appreciate it.

47:48.640 --> 47:53.400
It's not that people don't appreciate it, people want more and I think that's what,

47:53.400 --> 47:57.000
it's one of those things of being a human.

47:57.000 --> 48:00.960
This is something that bothers me about that whole 1%, 99% thing, I really hate that whole

48:00.960 --> 48:02.680
movement.

48:02.680 --> 48:04.160
I hate anybody that...

48:04.160 --> 48:06.520
I don't like that movement either.

48:06.520 --> 48:10.160
Anybody that talks about inequality, I could not care, I could not care less about inequality,

48:10.160 --> 48:13.680
I couldn't, because here's my argument for any, about the whole thing.

48:13.680 --> 48:18.920
So if you are part of the 99% and you're just middle class or like, let's say even lower

48:18.920 --> 48:20.400
middle class, okay?

48:20.400 --> 48:24.240
Of course poverty line like, even the poverty line is like okay compared to other countries,

48:24.240 --> 48:26.440
but let's just talk about lower middle class, okay?

48:26.440 --> 48:28.440
You're talking about here.

48:28.440 --> 48:32.240
Yeah, so here in the States, here and the States, okay?

48:33.200 --> 48:38.880
You have it, you are living like royalty lived like a thousand years ago, not royalty but

48:38.880 --> 48:41.680
like the rich lived a thousand years ago, way better than them.

48:41.680 --> 48:46.440
You have cell phones, you have like right angles on streets and like all these, you

48:46.440 --> 48:48.160
have cars and do you know what I mean?

48:48.160 --> 48:53.000
Like you have it better, why do you care if someone else has it even better than you if

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
you have it good?

48:54.000 --> 48:57.680
You should never look at someone else's plate and be like, why do they have more food?

48:57.680 --> 49:00.120
You should look at your own plate and do I have enough and maybe look at someone else

49:00.120 --> 49:01.720
and be like, do they have enough?

49:01.720 --> 49:04.800
But don't look at someone else and be like, I should be having that, that sort of feeling

49:04.800 --> 49:10.760
of being jealous and being like, oh it's unfair, it's unfair that they have more.

49:10.760 --> 49:12.680
Who cares as long as you're satisfied.

49:12.680 --> 49:15.120
That's exactly how they feel though.

49:15.120 --> 49:20.280
I know but that's, to me that's, it's like, it doesn't, it's so irrational like you're,

49:20.280 --> 49:21.280
you have every...

49:21.280 --> 49:24.080
It's not irrational for them, it's irrational.

49:24.080 --> 49:26.480
No, it's real to them but it's still irrational.

49:26.480 --> 49:34.560
For you and for me and for people who have certain kind of comfort, that's the thing.

49:34.560 --> 49:38.800
That's what I mean by not all of us experiencing the same reality.

49:38.800 --> 49:45.360
Here's the thing, here's the thing, if I told you, if I just, people's concept of what happy

49:45.360 --> 49:49.200
is is like so fucked up, that's why I have something against happiness but I can go on

49:49.200 --> 49:53.840
for like hours about that but like, so people say, if I ask you, let's take someone who's

49:53.840 --> 49:54.840
happy okay?

49:55.800 --> 49:56.800
So are you happy?

49:56.800 --> 49:57.800
And they say yes.

49:57.800 --> 50:00.040
I'm like okay, can you list out all the reasons why you're happy?

50:00.040 --> 50:05.440
And then they're like, okay, I can go to a restaurant whenever I want, I can blah blah

50:05.440 --> 50:08.640
blah, I have kids that love me blah blah, okay?

50:08.640 --> 50:14.360
Then I say, okay by the way, that's great, now did you know that there are aliens that

50:14.360 --> 50:17.800
live and they live in like, you didn't know this but they live like right on the outer

50:17.800 --> 50:23.800
atmosphere of earth and they live in this great like hunger games, like palace of like

50:23.800 --> 50:29.120
royalty and it turns out that you can actually fly as a human but they've limited you and

50:29.120 --> 50:30.120
you can't fly.

50:30.120 --> 50:31.120
Are you happy?

50:31.120 --> 50:33.800
Most people would be like no, what the fuck, that's fucked up.

50:33.800 --> 50:38.080
But what on that list that you just wrote down that made you happy has changed?

50:38.080 --> 50:41.880
That list is exactly the same, you should still be happy but now you feel like oh I'm

50:41.880 --> 50:44.840
missing out on something and then that makes you unhappy?

50:44.840 --> 50:45.840
Your list has not changed.

50:45.840 --> 50:47.560
Yeah, they want to be special.

50:48.360 --> 50:49.520
That bothers me so much.

50:49.520 --> 50:51.840
So your happiness is relative to other people's?

50:51.840 --> 50:53.720
Yeah, for them.

50:53.720 --> 50:55.280
I'm not saying it's right, I think it's-

50:55.280 --> 50:56.280
I know, that's just-

50:56.280 --> 51:00.560
But that's not going to change, it's just a matter of evolution, I think chimps are like

51:00.560 --> 51:01.560
that.

51:01.560 --> 51:04.760
Exactly, exactly, there's the whole thing about the chimp and the grapes.

51:04.760 --> 51:08.920
I've always thought if we want to understand people really well, we have to start watching

51:08.920 --> 51:14.440
a lot of documentaries about chimps because that explains a lot, the jealousy, greed-

51:14.440 --> 51:19.520
Right, no, they have evolutionary roots but that doesn't mean that they're okay.

51:19.520 --> 51:24.600
Just like, I'm not looking at someone being unjust and then looking at a chimp yelling

51:24.600 --> 51:27.600
about not getting enough grapes and being like, oh yeah, well that chimp really had

51:27.600 --> 51:32.840
a point, that chimp is really smart and really deduced based on logic and reason behind that.

51:32.840 --> 51:38.040
For the chimp's logic and reason, that's the thing, how are we going to compare a human

51:38.040 --> 51:40.680
logic and reason with chimp's logic and reason?

51:40.680 --> 51:42.400
But that's what they're doing.

51:42.480 --> 51:46.720
I have the same feeling about religion and extremely religious people, that they just

51:46.720 --> 51:53.200
buy into that fact because that gives them a sense of purpose and that's a problem I

51:53.200 --> 51:54.200
think.

51:54.200 --> 51:58.920
When you say it's rational to them, what do you mean?

51:58.920 --> 52:01.520
Because okay, I can see how they can think it's rational.

52:01.520 --> 52:07.800
What I mean is that I'm going to quote David Lynch, a great director and philosopher I

52:07.800 --> 52:14.080
would say, that if you have a golf ball size consciousness, your understanding of the world

52:14.080 --> 52:16.840
is a golf ball size.

52:16.840 --> 52:21.200
If you have a box, that's the amount of your understanding of the world.

52:21.200 --> 52:25.520
If it's infinite, okay, okay, fine.

52:25.520 --> 52:30.960
So what I would say, what they are experiencing, you know, that triangle of our crucial needs

52:30.960 --> 52:34.120
and stuff, it starts with, yeah.

52:34.120 --> 52:42.560
So they have less amount of security and comfort and ease of mind than you, me and privileged

52:42.560 --> 52:43.560
people.

52:43.560 --> 52:47.360
It's not that we're privileged, but we're pretty comfortable.

52:47.360 --> 52:51.880
Yeah, okay, I know what you're going to say, sorry to cut you off, but what I would say

52:51.880 --> 52:56.960
to that is like, there's a difference between something being rational to them and it being

52:56.960 --> 52:58.200
rational.

52:58.200 --> 52:59.960
So objectively rational.

52:59.960 --> 53:02.400
I don't think there is such a thing as objective rationality.

53:02.400 --> 53:06.160
Oh, well, we can talk about that another time.

53:06.160 --> 53:07.160
Yeah.

53:07.160 --> 53:17.840
I think we, there are certain laws like gravity and yeah, but nothing like related, even,

53:17.840 --> 53:21.000
you know, related to morality at all.

53:21.000 --> 53:25.520
What about Sam Harris's whole moral landscape?

53:25.520 --> 53:26.520
I love that book.

53:26.520 --> 53:28.680
And do you not agree with it?

53:28.680 --> 53:29.680
I don't know.

53:29.680 --> 53:37.640
I think he changed also a lot of, not a lot, but some way of thinking about his too.

53:37.640 --> 53:39.560
After that book came out, you mean?

53:39.560 --> 53:45.340
There is a bit, I see the difference between moral landscape and wake up, right, or waking

53:45.340 --> 53:46.340
up.

53:46.340 --> 53:47.340
Yeah.

53:47.340 --> 53:48.340
I don't know.

53:48.340 --> 53:49.340
Which one did you like more?

53:49.340 --> 53:50.340
Can I guess?

53:50.340 --> 53:51.340
Yeah.

53:51.340 --> 53:55.800
I think you like waking up more.

53:55.800 --> 53:56.800
I think so too.

53:56.800 --> 53:57.800
Yeah.

53:58.720 --> 54:01.960
So I really liked the moral landscape a lot and I just didn't like waking up.

54:01.960 --> 54:02.960
Yeah.

54:02.960 --> 54:03.960
Yeah.

54:03.960 --> 54:09.840
I listened to it and I was like, no, well, I mean, he just talks about spirituality,

54:09.840 --> 54:12.480
but there's nothing there that was like a new idea to me.

54:12.480 --> 54:13.680
It was more like just talking about spirituality.

54:13.680 --> 54:20.440
I basically like him coming to that place that he considers that, which I think is pretty

54:20.440 --> 54:21.440
cool.

54:21.440 --> 54:24.840
And just so your listeners aren't confused, when Sam Harris talks about spirituality,

54:24.840 --> 54:27.240
it's not like regular people talking about spirituality.

54:27.240 --> 54:31.280
He just, he's using that as a word because he has no other word to do.

54:31.280 --> 54:34.920
He's a neuroscientist philosopher who...

54:34.920 --> 54:35.920
Atheist too.

54:35.920 --> 54:36.920
Atheist.

54:36.920 --> 54:39.040
One of the greatest atheists.

54:39.040 --> 54:41.680
So let me ask you two final questions.

54:41.680 --> 54:46.400
The first one would be, what is the purpose of life?

54:46.400 --> 54:47.400
There is no purpose.

54:47.400 --> 54:50.760
A purpose kind of to me implies some sort of higher being.

54:50.760 --> 54:54.960
That's another reason why I have something against the word deserved.

54:54.960 --> 54:59.320
When anybody says, oh, you deserve this, there's something that irks me inside.

54:59.320 --> 55:00.320
And women say that a lot.

55:00.320 --> 55:02.880
This is all ties back to...

55:02.880 --> 55:05.840
We didn't get to talk deeply about your hatred for women.

55:05.840 --> 55:08.080
No, but women say this thing all the time.

55:08.080 --> 55:10.240
They're like, girl, you deserve that break.

55:10.240 --> 55:11.240
You deserve...

55:11.240 --> 55:13.720
Girls use the word deserve like far too much.

55:13.720 --> 55:15.000
Explain to me one sentence.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.360
What is the core difference between men and women?

55:17.360 --> 55:18.800
Oh, there's so many.

55:19.640 --> 55:26.760
So I'll tell you, a man's sort of power and status in his life comes from him struggling

55:26.760 --> 55:28.240
hard to make it.

55:28.240 --> 55:31.280
Okay, unless you're just really good looking, which there are very few guys that are good

55:31.280 --> 55:37.440
looking and just make it off their good looks, versus a girl who can just be...

55:37.440 --> 55:40.960
When I say girls, I'm talking about like, let's say you're seven and a half and above,

55:40.960 --> 55:43.560
because then if you're six and below, you're just...

55:43.560 --> 55:47.720
If you're five and below, you're like, I'm sorry, you might as well be a man.

55:47.720 --> 55:51.400
So I'm talking about like a certain status of women, okay?

55:51.400 --> 55:58.560
So if you're a woman, then you just like, guys would just like, take your luggage for

55:58.560 --> 56:00.160
you, just do everything for you.

56:00.160 --> 56:01.160
I remember I was...

56:01.160 --> 56:05.720
There's a story about this guy who did stand up for like 30 years, was doing great.

56:05.720 --> 56:09.200
Finally like, he went off stage, like everyone's applauding and like turning heads and stuff.

56:09.200 --> 56:11.200
I'm like, he's like, yeah, I feel good.

56:11.200 --> 56:15.600
Then some hot girl came in like two minutes later and all the heads turned to look at

56:15.600 --> 56:19.880
her in the same way that he got looked at because he was a celebrity.

56:19.880 --> 56:23.080
That's just quintessentially, that's what you have to do as a man.

56:23.080 --> 56:27.920
Those 30 years of experience to just kind of equal what a girl gets automatically.

56:27.920 --> 56:32.760
Yeah, but you should look at countries like Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan and those places

56:32.760 --> 56:39.320
that they keep their women in the closet and in the beekeeping suit and they can't even

56:39.320 --> 56:41.320
drive.

56:41.320 --> 56:47.880
So who gives a fuck if somebody can't get drinks or applause because they have big boobs?

56:47.880 --> 56:54.720
People are attracted to big boobs and they are to male physics, majority of people.

56:54.720 --> 57:04.440
I think we should all sort of aspire to be like Saudi Arabia and I'm just kidding.

57:04.440 --> 57:08.880
So I'm only talking about the Western world, of course.

57:09.000 --> 57:10.000
I don't care about the...

57:10.000 --> 57:13.240
I mean, I do care but I'm not ranting about...

57:13.240 --> 57:19.000
I'm not like gonna go tell a woman who's getting acid in her face like, yo, well, you had it

57:19.000 --> 57:21.320
good your whole life so now you get acid.

57:21.320 --> 57:23.000
I'm not gonna tell that, you know.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.040
So I'm talking about like...

57:25.040 --> 57:28.560
And then there's so much more awareness of women's issues than there are men but yet

57:28.560 --> 57:31.880
the society thinks it's totally the opposite.

57:31.880 --> 57:38.520
The way society thinks like, if you grew up in the 80s, if you were born in the 80s and

57:38.520 --> 57:41.880
above, you're just feminized.

57:41.880 --> 57:44.640
It's all liberal arts, like every...

57:44.640 --> 57:51.200
Even the word rape was only very recently made to incorporate a man.

57:51.200 --> 57:54.240
People think that women were more oppressed than they were.

57:54.240 --> 57:56.160
People think that women make $0.75...

57:56.160 --> 57:58.320
Oh, it's much better than it used to be.

57:58.320 --> 58:00.560
No, but also people think that...

58:01.040 --> 58:05.920
There are still a lot of problems like pay is a big deal, you know, call paying.

58:05.920 --> 58:08.160
No, but that's been shown to be false.

58:08.160 --> 58:13.600
Like, so another thing I used to study was economics like a little bit and there's so

58:13.600 --> 58:18.920
many economics, economic like just things about money that people are wrong about.

58:18.920 --> 58:21.920
So the whole $0.75 a dollar thing is shown to be false.

58:21.920 --> 58:27.920
If you make everything equal, like you try to control for, does this girl have the same

58:27.960 --> 58:28.960
education as the guy?

58:28.960 --> 58:32.080
Has she stayed in the company the same as the guy, the same position?

58:32.080 --> 58:33.840
Then they get paid the same.

58:33.840 --> 58:35.160
It turns out they get paid the same.

58:35.160 --> 58:43.040
The difference is like if you add up, like in total, how much money do women make?

58:43.040 --> 58:44.040
How much money do men make?

58:44.040 --> 58:48.120
It's about 75% of what men make, something like that, okay?

58:48.120 --> 58:51.600
And then that comes in because women make different choices, they go into different

58:51.600 --> 58:52.600
fields.

58:52.600 --> 58:56.320
Men tend to go into engineering or whatever, women tend to go into whatever, other things

58:56.320 --> 58:57.320
that pay like...

58:57.480 --> 59:02.720
So you're saying the women who go to engineering do not have equal pay to men who are engineers?

59:02.720 --> 59:05.920
Oh, well then you have to also account for did they have kids?

59:05.920 --> 59:07.360
Did they take time off of work?

59:07.360 --> 59:10.660
So if you account for all these things and did a man take time off of work, blah, blah,

59:10.660 --> 59:13.520
if you account for those things and you hold them, that's what you have to do in science

59:13.520 --> 59:17.880
before you make a correlation between variables, you have to fix every other thing to say that

59:17.880 --> 59:22.880
these things are the causation, there's a cause and effect.

59:22.880 --> 59:25.200
Then it turns out that the pays are equal.

59:25.200 --> 59:27.120
And so I could just send you so many videos on that.

59:27.120 --> 59:30.680
There's search pay wage gap myth or something like that.

59:30.680 --> 59:32.080
There's tons of videos about that.

59:32.080 --> 59:33.800
Yeah, it's a myth.

59:33.800 --> 59:37.720
Are you following US politics, US election campaigns?

59:37.720 --> 59:45.040
No, no, I don't know who Bernie Sanders is and I don't know, I want...

59:45.040 --> 59:48.680
I would love it if Trump got elected.

59:48.680 --> 59:50.800
I kind of like what he says.

59:50.800 --> 59:55.400
A lot of people say like, yeah, Trump sucks, like, oh, why?

59:55.400 --> 59:58.080
He's just a negative man.

59:58.080 --> 01:00:01.240
That's not even like an argument against like, what particular policy...

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:05.760
Well, you know, actually, we were talking on the first episode of this podcast how I'm

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:10.400
going to support Donald Trump if Bernie Sanders don't get the Democratic candidacy because

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:13.060
Hillary Clinton is the other person.

01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:19.160
But she brought Sarah Palin to the game and that's where he lost me because that is just...

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.160
Trump brought Palin?

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:21.160
Yeah.

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.160
It's just...

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.160
Marketing.

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:28.600
It is, but I mean, to what kind of people is just bringing shit show, you know?

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:31.600
Anyways, let me ask you the final question.

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:38.320
If you come across an intelligent alien from a different civilization, what would you tell

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:44.320
that intelligent alien as the worst things that humanity has done and what would you

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:47.160
tell that alien as the best thing that we have achieved?

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:50.160
Oh, that's a very good question.

01:00:50.160 --> 01:01:01.160
Um, the worst thing is like, just torture, just people being tortured.

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:10.160
Like how, just, you know, like, obviously people will say, yeah, the US torture is going

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:11.160
to be...

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:12.160
Well, okay, fine, whatever.

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:13.160
It's in the US too.

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:18.560
But also Japan and like World War II, like some of this stuff they did is crazy and no

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:21.560
one hears about it because it's just not taught, they talk more about Germany.

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:28.560
So like it's like, I used to just, like I said, how sometimes I want to get mad at things.

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.720
Like I want to get mad at that girl on my Facebook.

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:34.760
Sometimes I want to know, I want to know the real, how the world really is.

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:37.800
Even if it makes me like feel sad and depressed.

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:40.720
So sometimes I'd like purposely go out of the way to search for depressing facts just

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:45.720
because I feel like to get a sort of broad-eyed, bird's-eye view of everything.

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:47.680
Some of the things Japan did was fucked up.

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:52.360
So just suffering and torture is the worst.

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:54.000
I don't particularly care about slavery.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:59.480
I mean, no, don't misconstruing me anybody in the future.

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:04.960
What I mean is like, to me, slavery compared to suffering, compared to torturing, sorry,

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:05.960
is not that bad.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:08.920
Unless you torture your slaves.

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:10.920
There's nothing that compares to torture.

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:13.840
So torture is the worst that humanity does.

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:17.440
Even to animals, I really hate that.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:33.480
The best thing is, I don't know, the internet, the internet, something like that.

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:37.240
Yeah, it's probably something like that.

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:45.280
Or whatever is the start of a technological revolution that would eventually make the

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:46.280
internet anyway.

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:49.520
And the internet's going to make something else and make those other things and singularity,

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:50.520
blah, blah, blah.

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:53.240
So whatever started that, that was the best thing.

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:56.320
Because without it, we wouldn't be on that thing to the singularity.

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:58.720
And I think the singularity is going to be the best thing.

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:04.520
But whatever starts it is obviously also good because it started us into an almost inevitable

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:06.400
push to the singularity.

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:13.680
Like Ray Kurzweil shows, even past World War I and World War II, that law of accelerated

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:17.600
returns doesn't even perturb, despite World Wars.

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:19.080
It's almost like inevitable.

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.200
So yeah.
