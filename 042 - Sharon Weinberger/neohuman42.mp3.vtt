00:00.000 --> 00:04.720
So although I applaud the private companies, whether it's, you know, what Elon Musk or

00:04.720 --> 00:10.000
Jeff Bezos is doing, and I think it's incredible in that you need the private sector to take

00:10.000 --> 00:13.620
things, to make them economically competitive.

00:13.620 --> 00:17.960
Those companies could not exist without government funding and more to the point without DARPA

00:17.960 --> 00:30.640
funding Hello and welcome to the 42nd episode of Neohuman

00:30.640 --> 00:31.640
Podcast.

00:31.640 --> 00:38.520
I'm Agabahari at Agologist on Twitter and Instagram and you can follow the show on LiveInLimbo.com,

00:38.520 --> 00:41.200
iTunes and YouTube.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.640
With me today I have Sharon Weinberger.

00:43.640 --> 00:45.600
Welcome to the show Sharon.

00:45.600 --> 00:46.600
Thank you.

00:46.600 --> 00:47.600
Thanks for having me.

00:47.600 --> 00:50.400
Sharon Weinberger, why don't we start with your background, the work you've done and

00:50.400 --> 00:53.440
what are you focusing on mostly these days?

00:53.440 --> 01:00.120
So I'm a national security journalist and these days an editor at Foreign Policy Magazine.

01:00.120 --> 01:05.200
Most of my career has focused on writing on the intersection of science and technology

01:05.200 --> 01:07.200
and national security.

01:07.200 --> 01:10.280
That's been the vast majority of what I've written about over the years to include this

01:10.280 --> 01:11.680
book on DARPA.

01:11.680 --> 01:12.680
Great.

01:12.680 --> 01:18.120
Yes, you have a new book out called the Imagineers Award, the untold story of DARPA, the Pentagon

01:18.120 --> 01:19.960
agency that changed the world.

01:19.960 --> 01:23.440
So what is DARPA and where did it all begin?

01:23.440 --> 01:27.440
So DARPA is the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

01:27.440 --> 01:36.040
It's an agency that was created in 1958 amid the political turmoil of October 1957 when

01:36.040 --> 01:41.520
the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the world's first artificial satellite and this sort of

01:41.520 --> 01:48.120
became a political crisis because it represented to the American public and particularly to

01:48.120 --> 01:53.240
President Eisenhower's critics that the United States had fallen behind the Soviet Union

01:53.240 --> 01:57.900
in the space race and that the Soviets were advancing militarily as well.

01:57.900 --> 02:03.600
So amid this crisis, President Eisenhower authorized the creation of this new agency,

02:03.600 --> 02:09.280
the Advanced Research Projects Agency, whose primary goal would be to get America into

02:09.280 --> 02:10.280
space.

02:10.280 --> 02:14.200
So ARPA, as it was called at the time, was the nation's first space agency.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.840
This predated the creation of NASA.

02:16.840 --> 02:22.280
It sort of vacuumed up all of the space programs with this singular goal in mind.

02:22.280 --> 02:28.000
So can we consider moon landing ultimately the result of the creation of DARPA?

02:28.000 --> 02:30.520
In some ways, very much yes.

02:30.520 --> 02:33.320
So there's a caveat to that.

02:33.320 --> 02:40.080
DARPA, the D for defense was added in 1972, but let's just call it DARPA for consistency.

02:40.080 --> 02:44.880
They actually, they held the space programs for about a year and a half before losing

02:44.880 --> 02:49.960
them, first with the creation of NASA, which took over civilian space, and then eventually

02:49.960 --> 02:54.440
the military services, the Air Force, Navy, and Army sort of won a bureaucratic battle

02:54.440 --> 02:56.800
to get their space programs back.

02:56.800 --> 03:02.960
But even those initial programs that DARPA created in those first years were very critical.

03:02.960 --> 03:09.160
So the Saturn rocket, which took the astronauts to the moon, was the sort of the child of

03:09.160 --> 03:14.680
the first director of DARPA, who went to Werner von Braun and said he wanted to fund this

03:14.680 --> 03:16.680
rocket program.

03:16.680 --> 03:19.080
And the similar thing can be said about internet, correct?

03:19.080 --> 03:20.840
Because it started with ARPANET.

03:20.840 --> 03:21.840
Yes, absolutely.

03:21.840 --> 03:26.840
So the one thing that really cemented DARPA's reputation, and probably the reason it still

03:26.840 --> 03:32.120
exists today, because you know, agencies come and go, was that DARPA was very involved,

03:32.120 --> 03:38.920
and this goes back to the early 1960s, in creating the first computer networking program,

03:38.920 --> 03:45.000
which by the late 1960s became ARPANET, which was the first linking of computers around

03:45.000 --> 03:46.720
the country.

03:46.720 --> 03:50.680
When this was transitioned to the civilian world under the National Science Foundation,

03:50.680 --> 03:52.800
it became the internet.

03:52.800 --> 03:56.600
That's very much something that DARPA can claim credit for and is what cemented its

03:56.600 --> 03:59.280
sort of modern reputation as an innovation powerhouse.

03:59.280 --> 04:04.840
So you mentioned that DARPA started as a part of a Cold War, the Cold War ended more than

04:04.840 --> 04:05.840
20 years.

04:05.840 --> 04:10.800
What is the role of DARPA today, and what are they mostly focused on right now, today?

04:10.800 --> 04:12.680
That's an excellent question.

04:12.680 --> 04:17.260
The hardest period of DARPA's existence, because a lot of what my book does is charts the ups

04:17.260 --> 04:21.960
and downs of DARPA's history, whether it's the Vietnam War, or the height of the Cold

04:21.960 --> 04:22.960
War.

04:22.960 --> 04:27.560
So after the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990s was really DARPA's in some ways most

04:27.560 --> 04:32.680
depressing period, because here you have an agency that was created to keep us technologically

04:32.680 --> 04:36.960
ahead of the Soviet Union, and then the Soviet Union doesn't exist.

04:36.960 --> 04:41.600
So they went through sort of this depressing and turbulent period where they tried to reinvent

04:41.600 --> 04:46.440
themselves as sort of a dual-use agency, you know, maybe we can focus more on civilian

04:46.440 --> 04:47.440
projects.

04:47.440 --> 04:48.440
It didn't work well.

04:48.440 --> 04:54.520
They sort of had failed or irrelevant project after failed and irrelevant project.

04:54.520 --> 05:00.120
And then after 9-11, they in some senses tried to reinvent, you had a new enemy, you know,

05:00.120 --> 05:05.000
the war on terror was sort of the ups and downs of that.

05:05.000 --> 05:10.280
And they had something of a resurgence, but they're struggling now.

05:10.280 --> 05:16.360
One of the things that they tried to focus on under the last few years was neuroscience,

05:16.360 --> 05:21.080
trying to treat injuries from traumatic brain injury, basically a lot of the injuries that

05:21.080 --> 05:26.880
soldiers suffered from roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan, also treatment for post-traumatic

05:26.880 --> 05:27.880
stress disorder.

05:27.880 --> 05:33.640
So you see a lot of references to exotic projects funded by DARPA for brain chips.

05:33.640 --> 05:39.840
One of the things that they just turned again now to very much in the past year is hypersonic

05:39.840 --> 05:40.840
weapons.

05:40.840 --> 05:44.360
They're sort of, first of all, the current director of DARPA managed hypersonic weapons

05:44.360 --> 05:47.120
programs back when he was a program manager at DARPA.

05:47.120 --> 05:49.200
So he has a very direct interest in it.

05:49.200 --> 05:54.080
And you have with sort of the war of words with Vladimir Putin, sort of this resurgent

05:54.080 --> 05:56.480
interest on new exotic weapons.

05:56.480 --> 06:00.640
And you know, hypersonic weapons, these are weapons, you know, whether aircraft or missiles

06:00.640 --> 06:06.040
that travel many times the speed of sound is sort of in the news again.

06:06.040 --> 06:08.080
And that's what DARPA is pushing.

06:08.080 --> 06:11.480
And I think it's worth mentioning that DARPA overall is a pretty small agency.

06:11.480 --> 06:15.960
They have around, I think, three billion dollars in budgets and less than 200 people personnel,

06:15.960 --> 06:16.960
correct?

06:16.960 --> 06:17.960
Yes.

06:17.960 --> 06:22.640
And it's sort of interesting because those numbers sort of don't tell the whole story.

06:22.640 --> 06:28.400
So on one hand, you know, three billion or 3.2 billion is maybe one tenth of NASA's budget.

06:28.400 --> 06:33.720
But what makes DARPA's three billion dollars so powerful is it's not committed to programs.

06:33.720 --> 06:37.760
You know, NASA is spending, you know, X amount on the International Space Station.

06:37.760 --> 06:40.240
It can't just move money around.

06:40.240 --> 06:45.240
DARPA can and will very quickly start up new projects and can allocate tens of millions

06:45.240 --> 06:49.280
or, you know, some cases even, you know, a hundred of millions of dollars to something

06:49.280 --> 06:52.120
new or innovative.

06:52.120 --> 06:56.560
In terms of the personnel, yes, it is sort of interesting that DARPA has grown a lot

06:56.560 --> 06:57.560
over the years.

06:57.560 --> 07:02.400
When I was going through the archives, DARPA in the 1960s, which in some ways was its most

07:02.400 --> 07:08.440
innovative period, the roster of DARPA personnel could fit on an index card.

07:08.440 --> 07:14.260
And now it's a small phone book because you have under 200 employees of DARPA, but they

07:14.260 --> 07:20.040
also employ now sort of an arsenal of private contractors who provide everything from technical

07:20.040 --> 07:22.200
support to administrative support.

07:22.200 --> 07:26.440
But yet still, this is much leaner than most parts of government.

07:26.440 --> 07:32.160
Recently, we had a news that Google is aiding Department of Defense with their drones with

07:32.160 --> 07:34.200
Google's AI technology.

07:34.200 --> 07:40.880
What are the chances of private sector to completely replace DARPA and maybe even extend

07:40.880 --> 07:43.760
on the role that DARPA is playing in the government today?

07:43.760 --> 07:48.280
I don't think in any sense it can replace DARPA because DARPA's role is unique.

07:48.280 --> 07:53.040
You know, it is at the end of the day, it is to develop weapons and technology for the

07:53.040 --> 07:54.040
Pentagon.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.520
So DARPA itself doesn't create these things.

07:56.520 --> 08:02.520
It funds these things, you know, whether at private companies like Google or at smaller

08:02.520 --> 08:03.520
companies.

08:03.520 --> 08:06.960
DARPA is the program, man, it's sort of the organizer of this funding.

08:06.960 --> 08:10.940
I mean, even for Google, when it's working on artificial intelligence for the military,

08:10.940 --> 08:14.940
it's not like it sits in its R&D lab and creates something for the military.

08:14.940 --> 08:17.680
It's directed by someone.

08:17.680 --> 08:18.680
So that's one thing.

08:18.680 --> 08:24.040
One of the things that has changed over the years is, you know, most of our modern computer

08:24.040 --> 08:28.600
science departments and companies can trace their lineage directly back to DARPA.

08:28.600 --> 08:34.640
In the 1960s, when DARPA got into computer science, it was the only player in the, you

08:34.640 --> 08:37.840
know, it was the player, you know, there was no one else out there.

08:37.840 --> 08:42.360
But DARPA now has other areas, you know, like neuroscience, like hypersonics.

08:42.360 --> 08:46.040
You don't have a lot of private sector funding going into hypersonic weapons or hypersonic

08:46.040 --> 08:47.040
flight.

08:47.040 --> 08:50.760
So it's essentially, you know, what areas can DARPA move the needle in?

08:50.760 --> 08:55.000
You know, it still does good work in computer science, but it's very tiny compared to what

08:55.000 --> 08:56.200
goes on in the private sector.

08:56.200 --> 09:00.560
But to answer your question directly, no, I don't think the private sector can replace

09:00.560 --> 09:01.560
DARPA.

09:01.560 --> 09:05.560
DARPA is what has traditionally funded the private sector in areas that the private sector

09:05.560 --> 09:07.200
is not yet ready to invest in.

09:07.200 --> 09:12.500
Yeah, the reason I ask, because the space exploration program, there are a lot of private

09:12.500 --> 09:15.480
sector players on it now, like SpaceX.

09:15.480 --> 09:17.840
And NASA has taken advantage of their...

09:17.840 --> 09:18.840
That's a great point.

09:18.840 --> 09:25.680
But let me address something very specifically on that SpaceX.

09:25.680 --> 09:31.040
Its programs would not exist were it not for the government and specifically NASA, they're

09:31.040 --> 09:36.680
building on billions of dollars of government money that has gone into rocket science over

09:36.680 --> 09:37.680
the years.

09:37.680 --> 09:42.200
So although I applaud the private companies, whether it's, you know, what Elon Musk or

09:42.200 --> 09:47.600
Jeff Bezos is doing, and I think it's incredible, and that you need the private sector to take

09:47.600 --> 09:53.440
things to make them economically competitive, those companies could not exist without government

09:53.440 --> 09:57.320
funding and more to the point without DARPA funding.

09:57.320 --> 09:58.320
So let me ask you this.

09:58.320 --> 10:03.700
How much of our commercial and consumer technology today is a direct or indirect result of research

10:03.700 --> 10:08.520
and production by the DOD, the Department of Defense, and how much of that is the result

10:08.520 --> 10:09.520
of DARPA?

10:09.520 --> 10:14.200
So I think it'd be hard to quantify, you know, whenever someone tries to quantify something,

10:14.200 --> 10:18.520
I get these long reports that I find sort of methodologically flawed.

10:18.520 --> 10:19.520
What we can do is...

10:19.520 --> 10:24.600
So let's take an example, you know, sometimes, you know, DARPA officials will over-claim

10:24.600 --> 10:30.480
that cell phones, the microelectronics in cell phones, all trace back to DARPA.

10:30.480 --> 10:34.480
When I actually went back and interviewed some of the program managers, they're actually,

10:34.480 --> 10:35.980
they're much more modest.

10:35.980 --> 10:40.120
There are some microelectronics in cell phones that went to DARPA, but it's not that DARPA

10:40.120 --> 10:45.600
enabled the entire cell phone industry, but it certainly played a role in it.

10:45.600 --> 10:50.760
Certainly the internet with ARPANET was very direct to DARPA.

10:50.760 --> 10:56.280
If you want to talk about government innovations, modern satellite navigation, GPS, was a Navy

10:56.280 --> 11:01.720
project with actually at one point DARPA involvement in the very early years of the 1950s with

11:01.720 --> 11:03.440
a predecessor satellite.

11:03.440 --> 11:08.800
GPS navigation, you know, maybe it would have existed at some point in history, but we wouldn't

11:08.800 --> 11:15.600
have the GPS constellation today, but obviously it's a military system without DARPA, without

11:15.600 --> 11:17.960
DOD, and without government involvement.

11:17.960 --> 11:22.880
You know, so you can look across the spectrum of the things that we use in our everyday

11:22.880 --> 11:23.880
lives.

11:23.880 --> 11:30.240
Cell phones, internet, GPS navigation, drones is another example.

11:30.240 --> 11:36.520
Drones dates back directly to DARPA funding for projects starting as early as the 1960s

11:36.520 --> 11:37.520
and going through the 1990s.

11:37.520 --> 11:42.320
Again, it's not saying that drones never would have existed without DARPA, but they wouldn't

11:42.320 --> 11:47.080
have been this boom that they are now and certainly not on this time scale without DARPA's

11:47.080 --> 11:48.480
early funding for it.

11:48.480 --> 11:52.280
So I don't know how to quantify that except to say that, you know, if you look anecdotally

11:52.280 --> 11:55.000
at the projects, it's quite significant.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.280
Talk a little about why did you write the book at this point?

11:58.280 --> 12:02.080
Why did you think that this was a necessary book to be written now?

12:02.080 --> 12:09.640
So in two parts, the first was that, you know, as someone who's written about Pentagon science

12:09.640 --> 12:14.440
and technology for almost two decades now, you know, DARPA is both the most important

12:14.440 --> 12:18.560
and most intriguing player in this, both in terms of the amount of funding it has and

12:18.560 --> 12:23.680
this very unique role it's played in funding everything from oddball projects to very successful

12:23.680 --> 12:26.680
projects and some very, very unsuccessful ones as well.

12:26.680 --> 12:31.120
Just to be clear, this is a critical history of DARPA as they've had their ups and downs.

12:31.120 --> 12:34.800
And I've been talking with friends for a long time about, you know, what would a history

12:34.800 --> 12:36.800
of DARPA tell us?

12:36.800 --> 12:39.800
You know, is it as successful as it claims?

12:39.800 --> 12:44.520
And if so, why is it successful and is it still as successful?

12:44.520 --> 12:48.960
And so these sort of questions intrigued me and, you know, DARPA is not a good narrator

12:48.960 --> 12:51.320
of its own past.

12:51.320 --> 12:56.920
They commissioned one internal history in 1975 that was so good, so detailed and so

12:56.920 --> 13:02.440
critical that when it was done, the new director of DARPA basically classified it and locked

13:02.440 --> 13:04.920
it up in a safe for a decade.

13:04.920 --> 13:07.920
So they're not good since then of chronicling their own history.

13:07.920 --> 13:13.240
So the opportunity to go back through the archival records, to sue the Pentagon for

13:13.240 --> 13:18.600
records, to interview the former directors was really this opportunity to say like, okay,

13:18.600 --> 13:20.640
so is it as good as it claims it is?

13:20.640 --> 13:23.240
And to be honest, it's a mixed legacy.

13:23.240 --> 13:27.080
It's some great successes and some incredible failures.

13:27.080 --> 13:32.720
One of our listeners, Fritz Harald from Canada has a two part question he starts with.

13:32.720 --> 13:37.480
Since every technology is evolved from a military context, is technology tainted by design

13:37.480 --> 13:40.260
and therefore harmful to our future in the end?

13:40.260 --> 13:46.580
And is using billions of tax dollars annually to further military tools good for our society?

13:46.580 --> 13:49.960
And are we getting a good return on our investment financially and socially?

13:49.960 --> 13:51.800
Oh, that's a great question.

13:51.800 --> 13:55.660
So one of the things that I talk about, and one of the reasons I'm so drawn to these

13:55.660 --> 14:03.680
question of the military and science is that question, you know, the military funded science

14:03.680 --> 14:05.720
is very successful.

14:05.720 --> 14:11.180
It's very good at producing technologies in part because the Pentagon needs things.

14:11.180 --> 14:12.620
It needs to blow things up.

14:12.620 --> 14:17.800
It needs to create aircraft, you know, and so if you think those are good things, then

14:17.800 --> 14:20.480
military funded science is very good.

14:20.480 --> 14:26.200
If you're critical of, you know, drone warfare, if you're critical of the military technologies

14:26.200 --> 14:29.320
are created, then it's not a good thing.

14:29.320 --> 14:31.160
So I don't make a value judgment in that.

14:31.160 --> 14:36.960
What I try to point out to people is there is a consequence to having military funded

14:36.960 --> 14:37.960
science.

14:37.960 --> 14:42.980
It takes science and technology in different directions than civilian science, and so that

14:42.980 --> 14:46.280
is a judgment we have to make as a country.

14:46.280 --> 14:51.160
I raise this at the end of the book with neuroscience, where there are these very troubling ethical

14:51.160 --> 14:55.920
questions of having the military involved in neuroscience and medical research because

14:55.920 --> 14:58.240
the military has very different interests.

14:58.240 --> 15:02.840
They wish to, you know, I mean, be careful how I phrase that.

15:02.840 --> 15:08.720
The military's job is to, you know, basically defend the United States, which in many cases

15:08.720 --> 15:16.260
is through conducting warfare, and so is that an appropriate place to have a large part

15:16.260 --> 15:20.020
of your country's neuroscience research funded from.

15:20.020 --> 15:25.240
There are consequences to who funds research, and we have to be at least understand what

15:25.240 --> 15:30.000
the consequences are when we make decisions about whether that's good or bad.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.040
Is there any alternative though, because now we're hearing about how China is advancing

15:34.040 --> 15:39.440
in artificial intelligence and they have the three best supercomputers in the world.

15:39.440 --> 15:44.360
Is there really any way that we can imagine that the Department of Defense in the United

15:44.360 --> 15:48.040
States at one point would be like, okay, we're not really in a competition, we just want

15:48.040 --> 15:49.560
to serve our people in our country?

15:49.560 --> 15:55.560
Yeah, so there is, so if we take it down to the science and technology question, one of

15:55.560 --> 16:01.460
the reasons you don't have a DARPA in Europe or Japan or in many other countries is they're

16:01.460 --> 16:06.000
very wary of having the military fund science and technology.

16:06.000 --> 16:12.120
And it's funny because you have this sort of ongoing revolving door of European politicians

16:12.120 --> 16:16.880
and bureaucrats coming to visit DARPA because they're fascinated by the DARPA model and

16:16.880 --> 16:22.360
wanting the successes of DARPA, but they absolutely know it would not be possible politically

16:22.360 --> 16:28.920
to have a military funded science and technology agency of DARPA scope in Europe or in Japan.

16:28.920 --> 16:32.160
To the China question is different, so I'm first of all a bit of a skeptic, I mean I

16:32.160 --> 16:36.800
think China's making great advances in this area, but I think there's a lot of hype surrounding

16:36.800 --> 16:41.400
Chinese advances in artificial intelligence and hypersonics, I think a lot of it is over

16:41.400 --> 16:42.400
right.

16:42.400 --> 16:43.400
Why do you think that is?

16:43.400 --> 16:48.760
First of all, because it's happened in the past, part of the history of the book that

16:48.760 --> 16:55.520
I cover is when the, it comes straight from the past, in the 1980s DARPA wanted to convince

16:55.520 --> 17:01.440
Congress to fund a billion dollar initiative in artificial intelligence.

17:01.440 --> 17:07.040
And so it went to Japan, which at the time was sort of the boogeyman that China is now,

17:07.040 --> 17:12.600
and toured their computer science and their artificial intelligence initiatives.

17:12.600 --> 17:16.680
And they came back and essentially lied, and you know I have the interviews where they

17:16.680 --> 17:21.520
talk about this, where they said, yes Japan is on the very verge of making artificial

17:21.520 --> 17:22.520
intelligence.

17:22.520 --> 17:27.880
Japan was nowhere near that, it's nowhere near that now, and so I see that again with

17:27.880 --> 17:28.880
China.

17:28.880 --> 17:33.000
China has very advanced computer science, but it is not on the verge of creating artificial

17:33.000 --> 17:37.960
intelligence, and frankly neither are we, it's being used in a sense for people who

17:37.960 --> 17:42.000
wish to hype their budgets to the United States, and you know is that good or bad?

17:42.000 --> 17:46.080
You know if it advances computer science, people do what they think is effective.

17:46.080 --> 17:48.360
And they've been successful in hyping it then.

17:48.360 --> 17:52.480
They have been very successful.

17:52.480 --> 18:00.160
What do you see as the biggest national security threat or threats to the United States today?

18:00.160 --> 18:10.160
Oh wow, I think the biggest threat to national security is ourselves, in the sense that we

18:10.160 --> 18:17.400
have been at war now for approaching 17 years, and we have a generation in the United States

18:17.400 --> 18:24.440
that have grown up thinking that it's normal to always be at war.

18:24.440 --> 18:30.840
And you see these same debates in Israel about concerns about generations now in Israel who

18:30.840 --> 18:33.720
think that warfare is normal.

18:33.720 --> 18:40.080
You know warfare, I am for a strong national security, I am for a strong military, but

18:40.080 --> 18:44.920
the goal of a strong national security and the goal of a strong military is to not be

18:44.920 --> 18:46.600
at war.

18:46.600 --> 18:50.880
And I'm very concerned about a mentality in the United States where we accept this

18:50.880 --> 18:51.880
as normal.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.760
It should not be normal, this should be the exception.

18:54.760 --> 18:59.760
I'm originally from Iran, you mentioned Israel and I always found Israel fascinating because

18:59.760 --> 19:03.880
they made so much with so little amount of resources that they had scientifically and

19:03.880 --> 19:09.160
technologically and it served their military and national defense.

19:09.160 --> 19:13.960
How do you see the future of countries like Iran or Saudi Arabia that they haven't invested

19:13.960 --> 19:16.600
as much on science and technology as a western country?

19:16.600 --> 19:19.080
How do you see the future of countries like that?

19:19.080 --> 19:26.480
A science and technology base is a very hard thing to buy, you have to invest in it.

19:26.480 --> 19:33.000
So yeah, let's take Saudi Arabia for an example which has spent a lot of money on its military

19:33.000 --> 19:38.960
on an advanced technology and you know look where it's ended them up in a long protracted

19:38.960 --> 19:43.740
war in Yemen that is a humanitarian disaster and it's not been particularly successful

19:43.740 --> 19:45.160
for Saudi Arabia either.

19:45.160 --> 19:49.120
I'm not an expert in Saudi Arabia but I'm guessing their science and technology base

19:49.120 --> 19:52.440
is not something that's been invested that heavily in.

19:52.440 --> 19:57.680
I could be wrong, I'm not familiar with the extent of different areas, different faculties

19:57.680 --> 20:01.560
at universities in Saudi Arabia but I'm willing to guess they've spent a lot on procuring

20:01.560 --> 20:05.840
military technology and not a lot on investing basic science.

20:05.840 --> 20:10.240
Because basically spending to buy technology is not going to replace investing to develop

20:10.240 --> 20:11.240
it locally.

20:11.240 --> 20:17.200
Well not just developing it but again having a science base, you know if you look at DARPA,

20:17.200 --> 20:21.320
if you look at the DARPA model, I mean some of what DARPA does is it does develop weapons

20:21.320 --> 20:28.080
but a lot of what it funds is in the science base for the future, you know in microelectronics,

20:28.080 --> 20:33.600
in biology, in areas that aren't going to necessarily result in an aircraft tomorrow

20:33.600 --> 20:38.480
next year or even in the next decade but there are things that advance our knowledge about

20:38.480 --> 20:40.440
the world.

20:40.440 --> 20:45.240
Is there a big picture objective or rather philosophy for DARPA or perhaps the DoD?

20:45.240 --> 20:50.840
There is, you know DARPA the motto that they've used in many recent years, going back several

20:50.840 --> 20:56.960
decades now, is preventing technological surprise and now in the sort of the post-Cold War era

20:56.960 --> 21:00.280
they sort of add and creating technological surprise.

21:00.280 --> 21:05.520
I think that they are struggling a bit in the post-Soviet you know world of what is

21:05.520 --> 21:09.520
our mission because we don't have a technological peer.

21:09.520 --> 21:14.440
You know now with the hype of China they can kind of hang their hat on that but it's still

21:14.440 --> 21:18.960
difficult, we're still much more advanced than China when it comes to military technology

21:18.960 --> 21:21.840
despite what you know you might see in the newspapers and magazines.

21:21.840 --> 21:25.200
Well as you said hype is beneficial to people who are getting the money.

21:25.200 --> 21:31.040
As it's always been everywhere in the private sector and in government and in national security

21:31.040 --> 21:34.880
and to a certain extent it's understandable but you have to at least be a little bit wary

21:34.880 --> 21:36.320
of what people are claiming.

21:36.320 --> 21:41.440
Yeah fair enough, as data is becoming the most valuable commodity how do you see the

21:41.440 --> 21:45.480
relation between humans and military evolve in the coming years and decades?

21:45.480 --> 21:50.560
You know so it's funny as you can kind of get the sense, I'm a bit of a technology

21:50.560 --> 21:57.160
skeptic in some ways, DARPA has invested a lot in data, it's certainly very important

21:57.160 --> 22:02.680
for the military, there's sometimes a tendency to wish a little too much out of this data.

22:02.680 --> 22:06.520
There was this program in Afghanistan where they were going to collect all of the data

22:06.520 --> 22:10.800
because you know the U.S. military has so much data, they have intelligence collected

22:10.800 --> 22:15.880
by the National Security Agency, they had aircraft going all over Afghanistan mapping

22:15.880 --> 22:21.280
every bit of terrain, they had social science data, I mean just as they tried to collect

22:21.280 --> 22:26.640
all this data and make predictions about where the next insurgent attack would be, what village

22:26.640 --> 22:33.800
would fall to the Taliban, it didn't really do a lot of good, I don't know what to say

22:33.800 --> 22:36.680
other than data isn't knowledge.

22:36.680 --> 22:42.640
Okay fair enough, what is next for you and where can people find about your work?

22:42.640 --> 22:48.000
Sure, so what's next for me is I've been toying with the idea of doing a military history

22:48.000 --> 22:52.880
of artificial intelligence to talk about some of the subjects that we've just spoken about.

22:52.880 --> 22:57.720
Really what it means when the military is the greatest funder of artificial intelligence

22:57.720 --> 23:03.240
and how that put in our country and Japan and China artificial intelligence on different

23:03.240 --> 23:04.240
trajectories.

23:04.240 --> 23:09.040
You know Japan went very different directions, not altogether successfully either with its

23:09.040 --> 23:11.080
artificial intelligence programs.

23:11.080 --> 23:14.000
So that's what I've been thinking about working on for a next book, but to be honest

23:14.000 --> 23:18.600
I'm still in sort of the formative stages of thinking about the framing of that.

23:18.600 --> 23:24.440
These days I mostly edit at Foreign Policy Magazine and foreignpolicy.com, I do have

23:24.440 --> 23:30.240
an article coming out next month which an MIT's Undark magazine, it's a science magazine

23:30.240 --> 23:34.660
at MIT where they asked me to write about something I didn't include in the book.

23:34.660 --> 23:40.440
So it's a chapter about how DARPA was responsible for creating the first national climate program

23:40.440 --> 23:44.760
and most of our understanding today about climate change and global warming comes from

23:44.760 --> 23:50.400
DARPA's concerns about the Soviet Union and what they were doing with nuclear weapons

23:50.400 --> 23:51.880
back in the 1960s.

23:51.880 --> 23:53.120
So that's what's up next.

23:53.120 --> 23:54.120
Fantastic.

23:54.120 --> 23:57.960
And let me ask you the last question that I ask all my guests, that if you come across

23:57.960 --> 24:03.600
an intelligent alien from a different civilization, what would you say as the worst thing humanity

24:03.600 --> 24:06.640
has done and what would you say as our greatest achievement?

24:06.640 --> 24:10.960
I would say warfare is the worst thing.

24:10.960 --> 24:15.120
The best achievement is ending warfare, which we haven't quite accomplished yet.
