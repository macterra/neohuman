1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
So although I applaud the private companies, whether it's, you know, what Elon Musk or

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,000
Jeff Bezos is doing, and I think it's incredible in that you need the private sector to take

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,620
things, to make them economically competitive.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,960
Those companies could not exist without government funding and more to the point without DARPA

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:30,640
funding Hello and welcome to the 42nd episode of Neohuman

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,640
With me today I have Sharon Weinberger.

10
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,600
Welcome to the show Sharon.

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,600
Thank you.

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,600
Thanks for having me.

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,400
Sharon Weinberger, why don't we start with your background, the work you've done and

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,440
what are you focusing on mostly these days?

15
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:00,120
So I'm a national security journalist and these days an editor at Foreign Policy Magazine.

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,200
Most of my career has focused on writing on the intersection of science and technology

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,200
and national security.

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,280
That's been the vast majority of what I've written about over the years to include this

19
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,680
book on DARPA.

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,680
Great.

21
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:18,120
Yes, you have a new book out called the Imagineers Award, the untold story of DARPA, the Pentagon

22
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,960
agency that changed the world.

23
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,440
So what is DARPA and where did it all begin?

24
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,440
So DARPA is the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

25
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:36,040
It's an agency that was created in 1958 amid the political turmoil of October 1957 when

26
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,520
the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the world's first artificial satellite and this sort of

27
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,120
became a political crisis because it represented to the American public and particularly to

28
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,240
President Eisenhower's critics that the United States had fallen behind the Soviet Union

29
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,900
in the space race and that the Soviets were advancing militarily as well.

30
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:03,600
So amid this crisis, President Eisenhower authorized the creation of this new agency,

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,280
the Advanced Research Projects Agency, whose primary goal would be to get America into

32
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,280
space.

33
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,200
So ARPA, as it was called at the time, was the nation's first space agency.

34
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,840
This predated the creation of NASA.

35
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,280
It sort of vacuumed up all of the space programs with this singular goal in mind.

36
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:28,000
So can we consider moon landing ultimately the result of the creation of DARPA?

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,520
In some ways, very much yes.

38
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,320
So there's a caveat to that.

39
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:40,080
DARPA, the D for defense was added in 1972, but let's just call it DARPA for consistency.

40
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,880
They actually, they held the space programs for about a year and a half before losing

41
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,960
them, first with the creation of NASA, which took over civilian space, and then eventually

42
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,440
the military services, the Air Force, Navy, and Army sort of won a bureaucratic battle

43
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,800
to get their space programs back.

44
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,960
But even those initial programs that DARPA created in those first years were very critical.

45
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:09,160
So the Saturn rocket, which took the astronauts to the moon, was the sort of the child of

46
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,680
the first director of DARPA, who went to Werner von Braun and said he wanted to fund this

47
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,680
rocket program.

48
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,080
And the similar thing can be said about internet, correct?

49
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,840
Because it started with ARPANET.

50
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,840
Yes, absolutely.

51
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,840
So the one thing that really cemented DARPA's reputation, and probably the reason it still

52
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,120
exists today, because you know, agencies come and go, was that DARPA was very involved,

53
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,920
and this goes back to the early 1960s, in creating the first computer networking program,

54
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:45,000
which by the late 1960s became ARPANET, which was the first linking of computers around

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,720
the country.

56
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,680
When this was transitioned to the civilian world under the National Science Foundation,

57
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,800
it became the internet.

58
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,600
That's very much something that DARPA can claim credit for and is what cemented its

59
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,280
sort of modern reputation as an innovation powerhouse.

60
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,840
So you mentioned that DARPA started as a part of a Cold War, the Cold War ended more than

61
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,840
20 years.

62
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,800
What is the role of DARPA today, and what are they mostly focused on right now, today?

63
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,680
That's an excellent question.

64
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,260
The hardest period of DARPA's existence, because a lot of what my book does is charts the ups

65
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,960
and downs of DARPA's history, whether it's the Vietnam War, or the height of the Cold

66
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,960
War.

67
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,560
So after the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990s was really DARPA's in some ways most

68
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,680
depressing period, because here you have an agency that was created to keep us technologically

69
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,960
ahead of the Soviet Union, and then the Soviet Union doesn't exist.

70
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,600
So they went through sort of this depressing and turbulent period where they tried to reinvent

71
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,440
themselves as sort of a dual-use agency, you know, maybe we can focus more on civilian

72
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,440
projects.

73
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,440
It didn't work well.

74
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:54,520
They sort of had failed or irrelevant project after failed and irrelevant project.

75
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:00,120
And then after 9-11, they in some senses tried to reinvent, you had a new enemy, you know,

76
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,000
the war on terror was sort of the ups and downs of that.

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,280
And they had something of a resurgence, but they're struggling now.

78
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:16,360
One of the things that they tried to focus on under the last few years was neuroscience,

79
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,080
trying to treat injuries from traumatic brain injury, basically a lot of the injuries that

80
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,880
soldiers suffered from roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan, also treatment for post-traumatic

81
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,880
stress disorder.

82
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,640
So you see a lot of references to exotic projects funded by DARPA for brain chips.

83
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:39,840
One of the things that they just turned again now to very much in the past year is hypersonic

84
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,840
weapons.

85
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,360
They're sort of, first of all, the current director of DARPA managed hypersonic weapons

86
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,120
programs back when he was a program manager at DARPA.

87
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,200
So he has a very direct interest in it.

88
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,080
And you have with sort of the war of words with Vladimir Putin, sort of this resurgent

89
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,480
interest on new exotic weapons.

90
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,640
And you know, hypersonic weapons, these are weapons, you know, whether aircraft or missiles

91
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:06,040
that travel many times the speed of sound is sort of in the news again.

92
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,080
And that's what DARPA is pushing.

93
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,480
And I think it's worth mentioning that DARPA overall is a pretty small agency.

94
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,960
They have around, I think, three billion dollars in budgets and less than 200 people personnel,

95
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,960
correct?

96
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,960
Yes.

97
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,640
And it's sort of interesting because those numbers sort of don't tell the whole story.

98
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,400
So on one hand, you know, three billion or 3.2 billion is maybe one tenth of NASA's budget.

99
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,720
But what makes DARPA's three billion dollars so powerful is it's not committed to programs.

100
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,760
You know, NASA is spending, you know, X amount on the International Space Station.

101
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,240
It can't just move money around.

102
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,240
DARPA can and will very quickly start up new projects and can allocate tens of millions

103
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,280
or, you know, some cases even, you know, a hundred of millions of dollars to something

104
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,120
new or innovative.

105
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,560
In terms of the personnel, yes, it is sort of interesting that DARPA has grown a lot

106
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
over the years.

107
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,400
When I was going through the archives, DARPA in the 1960s, which in some ways was its most

108
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,440
innovative period, the roster of DARPA personnel could fit on an index card.

109
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:14,260
And now it's a small phone book because you have under 200 employees of DARPA, but they

110
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:20,040
also employ now sort of an arsenal of private contractors who provide everything from technical

111
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,200
support to administrative support.

112
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,440
But yet still, this is much leaner than most parts of government.

113
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:32,160
Recently, we had a news that Google is aiding Department of Defense with their drones with

114
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,200
Google's AI technology.

115
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:40,880
What are the chances of private sector to completely replace DARPA and maybe even extend

116
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,760
on the role that DARPA is playing in the government today?

117
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,280
I don't think in any sense it can replace DARPA because DARPA's role is unique.

118
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,040
You know, it is at the end of the day, it is to develop weapons and technology for the

119
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,040
Pentagon.

120
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,520
So DARPA itself doesn't create these things.

121
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:02,520
It funds these things, you know, whether at private companies like Google or at smaller

122
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,520
companies.

123
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,960
DARPA is the program, man, it's sort of the organizer of this funding.

124
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,940
I mean, even for Google, when it's working on artificial intelligence for the military,

125
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,940
it's not like it sits in its R&D lab and creates something for the military.

126
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,680
It's directed by someone.

127
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,680
So that's one thing.

128
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:24,040
One of the things that has changed over the years is, you know, most of our modern computer

129
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,600
science departments and companies can trace their lineage directly back to DARPA.

130
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:34,640
In the 1960s, when DARPA got into computer science, it was the only player in the, you

131
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,840
know, it was the player, you know, there was no one else out there.

132
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,360
But DARPA now has other areas, you know, like neuroscience, like hypersonics.

133
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,040
You don't have a lot of private sector funding going into hypersonic weapons or hypersonic

134
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,040
flight.

135
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,760
So it's essentially, you know, what areas can DARPA move the needle in?

136
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,000
You know, it still does good work in computer science, but it's very tiny compared to what

137
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,200
goes on in the private sector.

138
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,560
But to answer your question directly, no, I don't think the private sector can replace

139
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,560
DARPA.

140
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,560
DARPA is what has traditionally funded the private sector in areas that the private sector

141
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,200
is not yet ready to invest in.

142
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,500
Yeah, the reason I ask, because the space exploration program, there are a lot of private

143
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,480
sector players on it now, like SpaceX.

144
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,840
And NASA has taken advantage of their...

145
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,840
That's a great point.

146
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:25,680
But let me address something very specifically on that SpaceX.

147
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,040
Its programs would not exist were it not for the government and specifically NASA, they're

148
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,680
building on billions of dollars of government money that has gone into rocket science over

149
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,680
the years.

150
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,200
So although I applaud the private companies, whether it's, you know, what Elon Musk or

151
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:47,600
Jeff Bezos is doing, and I think it's incredible, and that you need the private sector to take

152
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,440
things to make them economically competitive, those companies could not exist without government

153
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,320
funding and more to the point without DARPA funding.

154
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320
So let me ask you this.

155
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,700
How much of our commercial and consumer technology today is a direct or indirect result of research

156
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,520
and production by the DOD, the Department of Defense, and how much of that is the result

157
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,520
of DARPA?

158
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,200
So I think it'd be hard to quantify, you know, whenever someone tries to quantify something,

159
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,520
I get these long reports that I find sort of methodologically flawed.

160
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,520
What we can do is...

161
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:24,600
So let's take an example, you know, sometimes, you know, DARPA officials will over-claim

162
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,480
that cell phones, the microelectronics in cell phones, all trace back to DARPA.

163
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,480
When I actually went back and interviewed some of the program managers, they're actually,

164
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,980
they're much more modest.

165
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,120
There are some microelectronics in cell phones that went to DARPA, but it's not that DARPA

166
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:45,600
enabled the entire cell phone industry, but it certainly played a role in it.

167
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,760
Certainly the internet with ARPANET was very direct to DARPA.

168
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:56,280
If you want to talk about government innovations, modern satellite navigation, GPS, was a Navy

169
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:01,720
project with actually at one point DARPA involvement in the very early years of the 1950s with

170
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,440
a predecessor satellite.

171
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,800
GPS navigation, you know, maybe it would have existed at some point in history, but we wouldn't

172
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:15,600
have the GPS constellation today, but obviously it's a military system without DARPA, without

173
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,960
DOD, and without government involvement.

174
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,880
You know, so you can look across the spectrum of the things that we use in our everyday

175
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,880
lives.

176
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:30,240
Cell phones, internet, GPS navigation, drones is another example.

177
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,520
Drones dates back directly to DARPA funding for projects starting as early as the 1960s

178
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,520
and going through the 1990s.

179
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:42,320
Again, it's not saying that drones never would have existed without DARPA, but they wouldn't

180
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,080
have been this boom that they are now and certainly not on this time scale without DARPA's

181
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,480
early funding for it.

182
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,280
So I don't know how to quantify that except to say that, you know, if you look anecdotally

183
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,000
at the projects, it's quite significant.

184
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,280
Talk a little about why did you write the book at this point?

185
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,080
Why did you think that this was a necessary book to be written now?

186
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:09,640
So in two parts, the first was that, you know, as someone who's written about Pentagon science

187
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,440
and technology for almost two decades now, you know, DARPA is both the most important

188
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,560
and most intriguing player in this, both in terms of the amount of funding it has and

189
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,680
this very unique role it's played in funding everything from oddball projects to very successful

190
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,680
projects and some very, very unsuccessful ones as well.

191
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,120
Just to be clear, this is a critical history of DARPA as they've had their ups and downs.

192
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,800
And I've been talking with friends for a long time about, you know, what would a history

193
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
of DARPA tell us?

194
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,800
You know, is it as successful as it claims?

195
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,520
And if so, why is it successful and is it still as successful?

196
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,960
And so these sort of questions intrigued me and, you know, DARPA is not a good narrator

197
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,320
of its own past.

198
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,920
They commissioned one internal history in 1975 that was so good, so detailed and so

199
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:02,440
critical that when it was done, the new director of DARPA basically classified it and locked

200
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,920
it up in a safe for a decade.

201
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,920
So they're not good since then of chronicling their own history.

202
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,240
So the opportunity to go back through the archival records, to sue the Pentagon for

203
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,600
records, to interview the former directors was really this opportunity to say like, okay,

204
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,640
so is it as good as it claims it is?

205
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,240
And to be honest, it's a mixed legacy.

206
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,080
It's some great successes and some incredible failures.

207
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:32,720
One of our listeners, Fritz Harald from Canada has a two part question he starts with.

208
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,480
Since every technology is evolved from a military context, is technology tainted by design

209
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,260
and therefore harmful to our future in the end?

210
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:46,580
And is using billions of tax dollars annually to further military tools good for our society?

211
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,960
And are we getting a good return on our investment financially and socially?

212
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,800
Oh, that's a great question.

213
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,660
So one of the things that I talk about, and one of the reasons I'm so drawn to these

214
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:03,680
question of the military and science is that question, you know, the military funded science

215
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,720
is very successful.

216
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:11,180
It's very good at producing technologies in part because the Pentagon needs things.

217
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,620
It needs to blow things up.

218
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:17,800
It needs to create aircraft, you know, and so if you think those are good things, then

219
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,480
military funded science is very good.

220
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,200
If you're critical of, you know, drone warfare, if you're critical of the military technologies

221
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,320
are created, then it's not a good thing.

222
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,160
So I don't make a value judgment in that.

223
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,960
What I try to point out to people is there is a consequence to having military funded

224
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,960
science.

225
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,980
It takes science and technology in different directions than civilian science, and so that

226
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,280
is a judgment we have to make as a country.

227
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:51,160
I raise this at the end of the book with neuroscience, where there are these very troubling ethical

228
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,920
questions of having the military involved in neuroscience and medical research because

229
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,240
the military has very different interests.

230
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,840
They wish to, you know, I mean, be careful how I phrase that.

231
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:08,720
The military's job is to, you know, basically defend the United States, which in many cases

232
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:16,260
is through conducting warfare, and so is that an appropriate place to have a large part

233
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,020
of your country's neuroscience research funded from.

234
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:25,240
There are consequences to who funds research, and we have to be at least understand what

235
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,000
the consequences are when we make decisions about whether that's good or bad.

236
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,040
Is there any alternative though, because now we're hearing about how China is advancing

237
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:39,440
in artificial intelligence and they have the three best supercomputers in the world.

238
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,360
Is there really any way that we can imagine that the Department of Defense in the United

239
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,040
States at one point would be like, okay, we're not really in a competition, we just want

240
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,560
to serve our people in our country?

241
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:55,560
Yeah, so there is, so if we take it down to the science and technology question, one of

242
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:01,460
the reasons you don't have a DARPA in Europe or Japan or in many other countries is they're

243
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:06,000
very wary of having the military fund science and technology.

244
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,120
And it's funny because you have this sort of ongoing revolving door of European politicians

245
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,880
and bureaucrats coming to visit DARPA because they're fascinated by the DARPA model and

246
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:22,360
wanting the successes of DARPA, but they absolutely know it would not be possible politically

247
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:28,920
to have a military funded science and technology agency of DARPA scope in Europe or in Japan.

248
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,160
To the China question is different, so I'm first of all a bit of a skeptic, I mean I

249
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,800
think China's making great advances in this area, but I think there's a lot of hype surrounding

250
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,400
Chinese advances in artificial intelligence and hypersonics, I think a lot of it is over

251
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,400
right.

252
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,400
Why do you think that is?

253
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:48,760
First of all, because it's happened in the past, part of the history of the book that

254
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:55,520
I cover is when the, it comes straight from the past, in the 1980s DARPA wanted to convince

255
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:01,440
Congress to fund a billion dollar initiative in artificial intelligence.

256
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,040
And so it went to Japan, which at the time was sort of the boogeyman that China is now,

257
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:12,600
and toured their computer science and their artificial intelligence initiatives.

258
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,680
And they came back and essentially lied, and you know I have the interviews where they

259
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:21,520
talk about this, where they said, yes Japan is on the very verge of making artificial

260
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,520
intelligence.

261
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:27,880
Japan was nowhere near that, it's nowhere near that now, and so I see that again with

262
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,880
China.

263
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,000
China has very advanced computer science, but it is not on the verge of creating artificial

264
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,960
intelligence, and frankly neither are we, it's being used in a sense for people who

265
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,000
wish to hype their budgets to the United States, and you know is that good or bad?

266
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,080
You know if it advances computer science, people do what they think is effective.

267
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,360
And they've been successful in hyping it then.

268
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,480
They have been very successful.

269
00:17:52,480 --> 00:18:00,160
What do you see as the biggest national security threat or threats to the United States today?

270
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:10,160
Oh wow, I think the biggest threat to national security is ourselves, in the sense that we

271
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:17,400
have been at war now for approaching 17 years, and we have a generation in the United States

272
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:24,440
that have grown up thinking that it's normal to always be at war.

273
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:30,840
And you see these same debates in Israel about concerns about generations now in Israel who

274
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,720
think that warfare is normal.

275
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:40,080
You know warfare, I am for a strong national security, I am for a strong military, but

276
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,920
the goal of a strong national security and the goal of a strong military is to not be

277
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,600
at war.

278
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,880
And I'm very concerned about a mentality in the United States where we accept this

279
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,880
as normal.

280
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,760
It should not be normal, this should be the exception.

281
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,760
I'm originally from Iran, you mentioned Israel and I always found Israel fascinating because

282
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,880
they made so much with so little amount of resources that they had scientifically and

283
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:09,160
technologically and it served their military and national defense.

284
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,960
How do you see the future of countries like Iran or Saudi Arabia that they haven't invested

285
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,600
as much on science and technology as a western country?

286
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,080
How do you see the future of countries like that?

287
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:26,480
A science and technology base is a very hard thing to buy, you have to invest in it.

288
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:33,000
So yeah, let's take Saudi Arabia for an example which has spent a lot of money on its military

289
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,960
on an advanced technology and you know look where it's ended them up in a long protracted

290
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,740
war in Yemen that is a humanitarian disaster and it's not been particularly successful

291
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,160
for Saudi Arabia either.

292
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,120
I'm not an expert in Saudi Arabia but I'm guessing their science and technology base

293
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,440
is not something that's been invested that heavily in.

294
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,680
I could be wrong, I'm not familiar with the extent of different areas, different faculties

295
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,560
at universities in Saudi Arabia but I'm willing to guess they've spent a lot on procuring

296
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,840
military technology and not a lot on investing basic science.

297
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,240
Because basically spending to buy technology is not going to replace investing to develop

298
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,240
it locally.

299
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:17,200
Well not just developing it but again having a science base, you know if you look at DARPA,

300
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,320
if you look at the DARPA model, I mean some of what DARPA does is it does develop weapons

301
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:28,080
but a lot of what it funds is in the science base for the future, you know in microelectronics,

302
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,600
in biology, in areas that aren't going to necessarily result in an aircraft tomorrow

303
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,480
next year or even in the next decade but there are things that advance our knowledge about

304
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,440
the world.

305
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,240
Is there a big picture objective or rather philosophy for DARPA or perhaps the DoD?

306
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,840
There is, you know DARPA the motto that they've used in many recent years, going back several

307
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:56,960
decades now, is preventing technological surprise and now in the sort of the post-Cold War era

308
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,280
they sort of add and creating technological surprise.

309
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:05,520
I think that they are struggling a bit in the post-Soviet you know world of what is

310
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,520
our mission because we don't have a technological peer.

311
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,440
You know now with the hype of China they can kind of hang their hat on that but it's still

312
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,960
difficult, we're still much more advanced than China when it comes to military technology

313
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,840
despite what you know you might see in the newspapers and magazines.

314
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,200
Well as you said hype is beneficial to people who are getting the money.

315
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,040
As it's always been everywhere in the private sector and in government and in national security

316
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,880
and to a certain extent it's understandable but you have to at least be a little bit wary

317
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,320
of what people are claiming.

318
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,440
Yeah fair enough, as data is becoming the most valuable commodity how do you see the

319
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,480
relation between humans and military evolve in the coming years and decades?

320
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,560
You know so it's funny as you can kind of get the sense, I'm a bit of a technology

321
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:57,160
skeptic in some ways, DARPA has invested a lot in data, it's certainly very important

322
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:02,680
for the military, there's sometimes a tendency to wish a little too much out of this data.

323
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,520
There was this program in Afghanistan where they were going to collect all of the data

324
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,800
because you know the U.S. military has so much data, they have intelligence collected

325
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:15,880
by the National Security Agency, they had aircraft going all over Afghanistan mapping

326
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:21,280
every bit of terrain, they had social science data, I mean just as they tried to collect

327
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,640
all this data and make predictions about where the next insurgent attack would be, what village

328
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:33,800
would fall to the Taliban, it didn't really do a lot of good, I don't know what to say

329
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,680
other than data isn't knowledge.

330
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:42,640
Okay fair enough, what is next for you and where can people find about your work?

331
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,000
Sure, so what's next for me is I've been toying with the idea of doing a military history

332
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,880
of artificial intelligence to talk about some of the subjects that we've just spoken about.

333
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,720
Really what it means when the military is the greatest funder of artificial intelligence

334
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:03,240
and how that put in our country and Japan and China artificial intelligence on different

335
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,240
trajectories.

336
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,040
You know Japan went very different directions, not altogether successfully either with its

337
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,080
artificial intelligence programs.

338
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,000
So that's what I've been thinking about working on for a next book, but to be honest

339
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,600
I'm still in sort of the formative stages of thinking about the framing of that.

340
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:24,440
These days I mostly edit at Foreign Policy Magazine and foreignpolicy.com, I do have

341
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:30,240
an article coming out next month which an MIT's Undark magazine, it's a science magazine

342
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,660
at MIT where they asked me to write about something I didn't include in the book.

343
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:40,440
So it's a chapter about how DARPA was responsible for creating the first national climate program

344
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,760
and most of our understanding today about climate change and global warming comes from

345
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:50,400
DARPA's concerns about the Soviet Union and what they were doing with nuclear weapons

346
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,880
back in the 1960s.

347
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,120
So that's what's up next.

348
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,120
Fantastic.

349
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,960
And let me ask you the last question that I ask all my guests, that if you come across

350
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:03,600
an intelligent alien from a different civilization, what would you say as the worst thing humanity

351
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,640
has done and what would you say as our greatest achievement?

352
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,960
I would say warfare is the worst thing.

353
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,120
The best achievement is ending warfare, which we haven't quite accomplished yet.
