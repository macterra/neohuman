00:00.000 --> 00:02.440
Did anybody hold your hand coming into this world?

00:02.440 --> 00:03.600
I'm talking about through the womb.

00:03.600 --> 00:06.120
Yeah, you got into the world and some doctor slapped you.

00:06.320 --> 00:07.720
You started breathing.

00:07.920 --> 00:09.680
And at some point you became a person.

00:09.880 --> 00:10.360
OK, yes.

00:10.560 --> 00:12.600
But no, you were alone on this whole

00:12.800 --> 00:16.960
journey and you're going to be alone when you leave.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.760
Hello and welcome to the 62nd episode of Neohuman podcast.

00:27.760 --> 00:31.240
I'm the Mugabahari etygologist on Twitter and Instagram.

00:31.440 --> 00:36.000
And you can follow this show on LiveInLimbo.com, iTunes, YouTube and Bitshoot.

00:36.200 --> 00:40.920
And with me, I have the pleasure of having the one and only John McAfee.

00:41.120 --> 00:43.760
Welcome to Neohuman podcast, John.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.200
Hey, well, thanks for having me on.

00:45.400 --> 00:47.440
Absolutely. Absolute pleasure.

00:47.640 --> 00:49.160
Why don't we start with you?

00:49.360 --> 00:51.760
I'm going to be I'm going to be doing tequila shooters.

00:51.960 --> 00:53.040
Oh, fantastic.

00:53.240 --> 00:55.760
With wine chasers while we're doing this, if you don't mind.

00:55.760 --> 00:57.920
I don't mind no disrespect whatsoever.

00:58.120 --> 00:59.520
No, but it is taken.

00:59.720 --> 01:01.840
It's late evening for me.

01:02.040 --> 01:07.600
I'm in a part of the world where it's it's late and a man, especially a man of 74,

01:07.600 --> 01:09.880
should be relaxing with wine and tequila.

01:09.880 --> 01:11.560
So I'm doing that while we're talking.

01:11.760 --> 01:12.640
Fantastic.

01:12.840 --> 01:13.400
Fantastic.

01:13.600 --> 01:17.360
So which part of the world are you located now?

01:17.560 --> 01:20.080
If I could tell you, I would.

01:20.280 --> 01:21.840
OK, fair enough.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.840
OK, it's interesting.

01:23.840 --> 01:26.760
Nobody or even our closest family has no clue where we are.

01:26.960 --> 01:27.640
OK, right.

01:27.840 --> 01:34.360
Not our children, Janice's brothers and sisters, nobody knows where we are.

01:34.560 --> 01:37.400
Is this due to the problems with the government?

01:37.400 --> 01:40.720
And I'm saying it because of the tweet that I saw you sending today,

01:40.920 --> 01:45.840
which I want to mention for our audience because it gives a very good context about

01:46.040 --> 01:50.240
where you stand perspective wise and worldview wise with respect to government

01:50.440 --> 01:52.720
that you have said, I am at war with my government.

01:52.720 --> 01:54.880
It was intended to represent this great

01:55.080 --> 01:58.840
nation of profound beauty, bordered by two vast and different oceans,

01:59.040 --> 02:00.960
a nation which nourished and nurtured me.

02:01.160 --> 02:03.640
Instead, it is a parasite on the very

02:03.840 --> 02:08.800
precious thing that it was intended to watch over.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.040
Yeah, well, no, there's no no secret.

02:11.040 --> 02:12.240
I've been at war with the U.S. government

02:12.240 --> 02:13.760
and moving on the run from the U.S.

02:13.960 --> 02:19.520
government since January of 2019 when the IRS convened a grand jury

02:19.720 --> 02:21.920
to charge Janice and I with tax fraud.

02:21.920 --> 02:25.560
Now, it's also no secret I have not paid taxes for 10 years.

02:25.760 --> 02:28.880
I refuse. I will not ever pay taxes again.

02:29.080 --> 02:30.760
Taxation is theft.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.960
We didn't have it prior to 1913 in America.

02:34.160 --> 02:40.760
And America was at that time the industrial giant of the world with no taxes.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.840
People go, how do we fund the government?

02:43.040 --> 02:44.800
Do some research, people.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.800
Taxation has merely made us go from an

02:48.800 --> 02:53.600
industrial giant to a country that manufactures nothing anymore

02:53.800 --> 02:57.240
other than war machines.

02:57.440 --> 03:01.480
What's going to happen when someone kicks our ass once and someone will?

03:01.680 --> 03:07.520
So we have got to straighten up and taxation is theft and it's killing us.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.640
So I don't pay it. Now, for eight years, they left me alone.

03:10.840 --> 03:16.720
Well, I've already paid 50 million dollars, over 50 million dollars in taxes in my life.

03:16.720 --> 03:21.760
I promise you, people, I have not received 50 million dollars in services.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.480
So I'm not paying anymore.

03:23.680 --> 03:28.680
Now, two years ago, I started speaking on the national stage about you don't want

03:28.880 --> 03:33.760
to pay taxes either, use privacy coins like Monero and distributed

03:33.960 --> 03:38.840
exchanges, and no one will ever know what your income or expenses are.

03:39.040 --> 03:46.000
Now, I live in a community of tens of thousands of people around the world.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.160
Many of them crypto leaders like Brock Pearson do not use cash.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.520
We don't use fiat currency.

03:52.720 --> 03:57.040
When I take a job, if you can't pay me in crypto, then I'm not working for you.

03:57.240 --> 04:01.480
And if I want to buy something and you won't sell it to me in crypto, then I don't

04:01.680 --> 04:04.120
need it because there's nothing you can't buy.

04:04.320 --> 04:08.600
Houses, cars, clothes, bulletproof vest, shoes, food.

04:08.800 --> 04:14.640
When we went silent, OK, so Janice and I, back to the story,

04:14.640 --> 04:17.520
we were chased all across the Caribbean.

04:17.720 --> 04:22.880
Finally, we got arrested in the Dominican Republic, who insisted we had to go back

04:23.080 --> 04:25.840
to America. This is after Belize?

04:26.040 --> 04:27.800
This is seven months ago, my friend.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.160
Yes.

04:29.360 --> 04:33.800
Yeah, no, we were in jail in the Dominican Republic for four days.

04:34.920 --> 04:38.040
Finally, I got legal representation

04:38.240 --> 04:43.840
and because we were arrested illegally, everybody knew this, but it didn't really

04:43.840 --> 04:47.680
matter to them because they're just going to ship me back to the States and it'll all

04:47.880 --> 04:51.480
be forgotten. No, I'm not letting it be forgotten.

04:51.680 --> 04:53.920
I got my lawyers to file a brief with the

04:54.120 --> 04:58.320
Supreme Court in the Dominican Republic demanding I simply get a hearing.

04:58.520 --> 04:59.800
Now, they have to do that.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.520
They have to.

05:01.720 --> 05:07.080
As soon as the paper was filed, we got out of jail and went to the VIP.

05:07.280 --> 05:12.240
They took us to the VIP lounge in the Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.

05:12.240 --> 05:15.400
And we were served by people with white

05:15.600 --> 05:22.440
gloves, champagne and caviar, along with heads of state who happened to be visiting.

05:22.640 --> 05:26.840
Now, that shift simply because I refused to roll fucking over.

05:27.040 --> 05:27.920
And so I did.

05:28.120 --> 05:31.160
Now, that was in July.

05:31.360 --> 05:37.240
So now they so we went to the Bahamas first as we took a boat to the Bahamas.

05:37.440 --> 05:39.360
The Bahamian government tried to arrest us.

05:39.560 --> 05:41.800
We found out about it in advance and left

05:41.800 --> 05:44.320
and went to Cuba. We were there for a month and a half.

05:44.520 --> 05:48.200
And the Cuban government called Janice and I in and said,

05:48.400 --> 05:55.120
the United States government has demanded that we either we turn you to America.

05:55.320 --> 05:58.120
Or expel you from our country.

05:58.320 --> 06:01.800
And we know you're a friend of Cuba.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.720
We're not going to return you to America.

06:03.920 --> 06:06.040
We know what would happen to you,

06:06.240 --> 06:11.200
but we do have to ask you to leave our country within 72 hours, which we did

06:11.200 --> 06:15.960
four days at sea, sailed into the Dominican Republic and were arrested before we even

06:16.160 --> 06:19.480
got into port and said, you have to go back to America.

06:19.680 --> 06:23.320
So on the airplane to London, this is after we got out of jail.

06:23.520 --> 06:25.520
I said, honey, we can't keep this up.

06:25.520 --> 06:26.520
We can't run forever.

06:26.720 --> 06:27.800
We have to go into hiding.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.360
So we did in London.

06:30.560 --> 06:31.640
We got there on a weekend.

06:31.840 --> 06:35.560
So I knew had it been a weekday, I would have gotten arrested.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.160
I know this, but it was a weekend.

06:37.160 --> 06:42.760
So the paperwork of the U.S. State Department has to file with the London,

06:42.960 --> 06:47.400
with the UK State Department, they have to get a court order.

06:47.600 --> 06:48.840
It takes days.

06:49.040 --> 06:50.000
So I knew we're safe.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.080
We spent one night in London, went underground and no one knows where we are now.

06:54.280 --> 06:54.800
Wow.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.320
And yet you are still running for president of the United States in 2020.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.680
Sure. Why not?

07:00.880 --> 07:06.680
So what what are the biggest obstacles you consider in front of this great country?

07:06.680 --> 07:10.760
Otherwise great country United States that you would want to tackle?

07:10.960 --> 07:14.840
I know that you are very driven by disruption to the entire system.

07:15.040 --> 07:18.400
And that's very well understood considering your position.

07:18.600 --> 07:24.880
But what other obstacles or shortcomings or main obstacles and shortcomings do you

07:24.880 --> 07:30.080
consider coming from the government that you want to disrupt or change fundamentally?

07:30.280 --> 07:34.400
Well, there's only one and we have to change it or we're all dead.

07:34.400 --> 07:40.200
And that is we have to wake up to the fact that it doesn't matter who the president

07:40.400 --> 07:46.160
is, that our two party system is a charade designed to keep us focused.

07:46.360 --> 07:50.680
And how do you get people focused and and agitated?

07:50.880 --> 07:54.600
Well, you you you create sides or two sides.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.600
There's the left and there's the right.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.360
There's the right. There's the wrong.

07:58.560 --> 08:00.320
There's the liberal and there's the

08:00.320 --> 08:05.480
conservatives and the gun owners and the gun haters. There are the social

08:05.680 --> 08:09.760
progressives and the conservative take care of yourselves.

08:09.960 --> 08:17.000
Well, there's plenty of shit there to create a tension between two groups of

08:17.200 --> 08:20.320
people, pretty much evenly divided, right?

08:20.520 --> 08:23.040
And that was perfect.

08:23.240 --> 08:27.520
Whoever played that out and made that happen.

08:27.520 --> 08:30.080
Brilliant. And we know who they were. It's the CIA.

08:30.280 --> 08:32.160
The CIA controls America, people.

08:32.360 --> 08:35.600
If you think otherwise, then

08:36.120 --> 08:37.240
you're not thinking.

08:37.440 --> 08:40.480
I mean, who controls the information flow?

08:40.680 --> 08:42.520
And and who?

08:42.720 --> 08:48.440
Because, first of all, the CIA calls presidents transients,

08:48.640 --> 08:52.800
transients, and they're there for four years, eight, Max and they're gone.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.040
And we have to train another new one.

08:55.240 --> 08:57.160
They don't bother training anymore.

08:57.160 --> 08:59.920
They just control them through information flow.

09:00.120 --> 09:03.120
Let me give you an example of second Gulf War.

09:03.320 --> 09:06.160
The CIA king, I don't know what they call

09:06.360 --> 09:12.120
themselves, probably not emperor of Middle East, whoever that may have been,

09:12.320 --> 09:16.480
decided that he wanted Iraq removed as a power.

09:16.680 --> 09:19.760
Apparently they weren't playing according to the plan.

09:19.960 --> 09:23.960
And so he called Washington and said, I want them bombed into oblivion.

09:23.960 --> 09:25.080
I want it done tomorrow.

09:25.080 --> 09:27.880
Are we clear? It's fucking with my plans.

09:28.080 --> 09:32.560
So Washington, their job is to make sure all of their kings and emperors and

09:32.760 --> 09:37.560
princes around the world are productive and doing what they want.

09:37.760 --> 09:40.920
It says, OK, all right, attend, Larry.

09:41.120 --> 09:43.560
We have to bomb Iraq tomorrow.

09:43.760 --> 09:45.440
You know, the president make it happen.

09:45.640 --> 09:49.240
And you get the team, the Congress team together and let them know what's

09:49.440 --> 09:53.760
happening and the guys go, OK, do we have free rein?

09:53.760 --> 09:55.720
Yes. Do what you have to do.

09:55.920 --> 09:59.840
They walked into the president's office and said, Mr. President,

10:00.040 --> 10:02.960
I regret to tell you, please, Mr. President, sit down.

10:03.160 --> 10:05.480
There is a matter of the gravest,

10:05.680 --> 10:09.760
both national and international urgency that we must make you aware of.

10:09.960 --> 10:12.960
Iraq has nuclear weapons

10:13.160 --> 10:16.960
and missile capabilities, double people,

10:17.160 --> 10:22.480
pardon, WMDs, right, nuclear weapons and

10:22.480 --> 10:28.960
missile capabilities capable of delivering them to our closest ally, England.

10:29.160 --> 10:34.760
And, sir, we have news that perhaps as soon as tomorrow

10:35.280 --> 10:38.640
that there might be a nuclear blast over London.

10:38.840 --> 10:42.240
Now, sir, it's not our job to advise you.

10:42.440 --> 10:47.160
No, no, we are simply here to inform you about the facts of life.

10:47.360 --> 10:48.640
And I'm sorry.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.400
Now, what choice did Bush have?

10:50.400 --> 10:54.320
None. And he said, sir, again,

10:54.520 --> 11:00.800
if something is not done to stop them by tomorrow, it will be too late.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.880
Four hours later, our stealth bombers

11:05.080 --> 11:12.880
eradicated the Iraqi military and the leveled bunch of Baghdad.

11:13.080 --> 11:17.800
And in the next few months, bomb them into the Stone Age, like the CIA prince

11:17.800 --> 11:21.280
or whoever he's called of the Middle East wanted.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.560
This is how it works, people.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.200
And you only have to lie.

11:25.400 --> 11:26.440
You can tell the truth.

11:26.640 --> 11:30.800
And by the way, we all knew there were no nuclear weapons in Iraq.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.760
The American people knew.

11:32.960 --> 11:37.760
Certainly everybody in Europe knew and all the Middle East knew.

11:37.960 --> 11:40.080
Who didn't know the president and Congress

11:40.280 --> 11:44.680
because they were briefed by the people who knew the CIA.

11:44.880 --> 11:46.600
So this is how it works.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.000
The president's got no power.

11:48.200 --> 11:53.200
It doesn't matter if Trump or Hillary Clinton or a derelict from the street

11:53.400 --> 11:58.840
or your pet dog is elected president, nothing will change in this country.

11:59.040 --> 12:02.200
And if if you don't want to accept these words,

12:02.400 --> 12:05.880
I mean, if you're over 21 and have lived through more than one election,

12:06.080 --> 12:11.640
you will have noticed one thing, nothing in your life changed.

12:11.840 --> 12:14.920
No more or less beer in the refrigerator.

12:14.920 --> 12:17.280
Your wife is still with you, still got your job.

12:17.480 --> 12:21.480
Nothing changes in your life when we change presidents.

12:21.680 --> 12:23.360
Can't you see those people?

12:23.560 --> 12:28.360
And so my job is not to be elected because I don't want the job.

12:28.560 --> 12:31.320
No one should want that job if it has any sense.

12:31.520 --> 12:34.760
And yet presidents don't even know they're being manipulated.

12:34.960 --> 12:39.880
No, my job is to try to wake people up to the fact that those in power,

12:39.880 --> 12:45.840
both the puppets and the puppet masters, are standing on your shoulders.

12:46.040 --> 12:51.160
It is the fruits of your labor, your creativity, your work,

12:51.360 --> 12:58.120
the sweat of your brow that supports the consumption of this corrupt government.

12:58.320 --> 13:01.000
So all you got to do, people, is shrug.

13:01.200 --> 13:07.240
Step across the line into a world where we don't use money anymore.

13:07.240 --> 13:11.400
Good God, people, that's an unnecessary thing in cryptocurrency.

13:11.600 --> 13:17.760
If you can't pay me in crypto, specifically Monero, then I'm not working for you.

13:17.960 --> 13:21.280
And if I can't buy something in crypto, then I don't need it

13:21.480 --> 13:24.360
because you can buy everything, cars, clothes.

13:24.560 --> 13:28.520
When it went to London, when we were deported,

13:28.720 --> 13:33.920
we went to a crypto-only hotel, beautiful, big-ass hotel in London, right?

13:33.920 --> 13:40.440
Food, the service, the room, the cleaning, the phone calls, all with crypto.

13:40.640 --> 13:41.840
Yeah, I want to talk about crypto.

13:41.840 --> 13:45.520
But before that, what you mentioned about the process leading to the Iraq War,

13:45.720 --> 13:50.360
it reminded me of the process that basically banks forced the president

13:50.560 --> 13:55.720
and the U.S. government to bail them out after the 2009 crash.

13:55.920 --> 14:00.480
Hank Paulson and Bernanke go into the president's office and demanding the bailout,

14:00.480 --> 14:04.680
saying that if we don't get this amount of money, the entire economy of the world

14:04.880 --> 14:07.600
is going to collapse within a day.

14:07.800 --> 14:10.440
Well, yeah, keep in mind,

14:10.640 --> 14:14.320
presidents don't just have one puppet master.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.560
They got a thousand strings that control them.

14:17.760 --> 14:19.720
The Fed is one of those.

14:19.920 --> 14:23.280
So the Secret Service is one of those.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.720
The military covert intelligence is one.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.720
The CIA is the big one.

14:27.720 --> 14:30.600
No, presidents have thousands of strings.

14:30.800 --> 14:31.880
The Fed is one of those.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.640
And that was Fed going, OK,

14:34.840 --> 14:35.840
bail these bastards out.

14:36.040 --> 14:38.560
It's not my interest for this to be happening.

14:38.760 --> 14:43.720
Are there strings ultimately coming from a unified kind of a big picture or no?

14:43.920 --> 14:46.160
They're just I wish I wish it was.

14:46.360 --> 14:48.400
Wouldn't that be an easy solution?

14:48.600 --> 14:50.800
This is going to remove that motherfucker forever.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
No, it's not.

14:52.200 --> 14:56.000
It is a totalitarian

14:56.000 --> 14:59.280
distributed system.

14:59.480 --> 15:02.080
Not decentralized, but deceptive.

15:02.280 --> 15:05.040
And so who the fuck knows who's at top?

15:05.240 --> 15:06.080
It varies.

15:06.280 --> 15:11.120
CIA is always number one or number two because they are the global

15:11.320 --> 15:15.320
intelligence agency of the world.

15:15.520 --> 15:17.800
And scary people, and they're the ones that be chasing me.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.200
And also, they were my biggest client for years.

15:21.200 --> 15:23.000
And I have good friends within the CIA,

15:23.000 --> 15:26.440
but even within the CIA, it's not a unified organism.

15:26.640 --> 15:28.840
It's broken into factions.

15:29.040 --> 15:32.080
I mean, the CIA is arranging with Paul

15:32.280 --> 15:37.600
Rowe of the Bahamas to get me arrested so I can be deported back to the state.

15:37.800 --> 15:41.760
And another branch of the CIA is calling me to tell me about it,

15:41.960 --> 15:45.680
which is how we got out of the country just before they came.

15:45.880 --> 15:48.720
And unfortunately, they didn't tell me about the Dominican Republic.

15:48.920 --> 15:50.680
We ended up in jail there.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.720
So this has been our life.

15:52.720 --> 15:57.560
We've been on the run for seven and a half years, seven and a half, maybe.

15:57.760 --> 16:00.120
Yes, seven and a half years.

16:00.320 --> 16:03.040
And during that time, we had been chased,

16:03.240 --> 16:10.160
shot at, chased at one hundred and twenty miles an hour on back roads of Arizona.

16:10.360 --> 16:15.840
People dressed in fake police uniforms storming our apartment complex in Portland,

16:16.040 --> 16:22.440
Oregon in 2013, September 2013.

16:22.440 --> 16:23.640
This has been our life.

16:23.840 --> 16:25.880
This is how we live, people. Why?

16:26.080 --> 16:29.240
Because I refuse to shut up.

16:29.440 --> 16:33.160
Which is which is exactly what most people don't do, even with your situation

16:33.360 --> 16:36.120
and others like you, like with the Sanj, for example,

16:36.320 --> 16:40.000
a lot of people without knowing much about what is going on, they're like, well,

16:40.000 --> 16:43.040
they must have done something wrong for being chased by the government because

16:43.040 --> 16:44.760
they just don't want to be involved in any of it.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.200
You know, it's just insane.

16:47.400 --> 16:51.160
I mean, that's what that sheep think, right, right, which is fine.

16:51.160 --> 16:53.240
But they vote.

16:53.440 --> 16:54.960
Yeah, OK.

16:55.160 --> 16:59.360
But fortunately, it doesn't matter who they elect, right?

16:59.560 --> 17:02.280
Because most of the sheep don't know what's happening.

17:02.480 --> 17:05.640
So but at some point,

17:05.840 --> 17:09.960
the sheep have to be woken up if you're going to move camp, for example,

17:10.160 --> 17:15.520
or get them out of the of harm's way from hungry wolves.

17:15.720 --> 17:19.880
And when sheep get unsettled, well,

17:19.880 --> 17:25.280
crazy things happen, they panic, they start running in strange directions.

17:25.480 --> 17:27.000
The shepherds

17:27.200 --> 17:32.200
are at their wits end trying to figure out how we're going to get these motherfuckers

17:32.400 --> 17:34.600
back into a safe place.

17:34.800 --> 17:37.040
So that's what the CIA doesn't want.

17:37.240 --> 17:40.520
That's why the CIA refuses to allow change.

17:40.720 --> 17:45.200
They don't want a president, but they let Obama go ahead, build Obamacare.

17:45.200 --> 17:46.120
They didn't give a shit.

17:46.320 --> 17:48.400
We'll tear it down to the next administration.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.600
And they did. It's gone.

17:49.800 --> 17:55.920
Four years of that man's life and trillions of our dollars down the tubes.

17:57.120 --> 18:00.000
Trump wanted a wall between Mexico

18:00.200 --> 18:01.640
and the United States.

18:01.840 --> 18:03.440
That was almost four years ago.

18:03.640 --> 18:04.480
How much was built?

18:04.680 --> 18:05.920
Ninety three miles.

18:06.120 --> 18:10.560
Ninety two of those miles merely repaired the existing wall.

18:10.760 --> 18:11.760
Nothing changes.

18:11.960 --> 18:13.520
We understand people.

18:13.720 --> 18:14.960
So stop worrying about that.

18:14.960 --> 18:17.240
Why do you care about things that don't matter?

18:17.240 --> 18:19.640
Who cares if a Republican or a Democrat?

18:19.840 --> 18:24.120
The problem is, is that you identify with a group.

18:24.320 --> 18:28.600
You are either a Democrat or a Republican.

18:28.800 --> 18:32.480
You either love guns or you hate guns.

18:32.680 --> 18:33.920
Well, who gives a shit?

18:34.120 --> 18:40.080
Does that mean you must align yourself with others who also think like you?

18:40.280 --> 18:46.920
God, what a horror of a world it would be if that was what everybody did.

18:46.920 --> 18:49.360
We would have violence in the streets.

18:49.560 --> 18:55.040
We would shoot each other from our automobiles, which we do sometimes.

18:55.240 --> 18:58.680
In a lot of parts of the world, that's exactly what's happening.

18:58.880 --> 19:00.440
This tribalism.

19:00.640 --> 19:07.920
Yes, but that's that's a regression of human society, culture and spirit.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.400
You don't.

19:09.600 --> 19:12.400
Stop identifying with groups.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.560
Stop wanting to belong.

19:14.560 --> 19:22.160
Stop wanting others to validate your feelings, thoughts, perceptions and beliefs.

19:22.360 --> 19:27.200
Because if they need validating, they are not valid.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.800
Be yourself.

19:29.000 --> 19:34.480
Stand alone for one thing, the truth of your life as you see it,

19:34.680 --> 19:39.240
because there is no group that you will fit into.

19:39.440 --> 19:42.160
Nobody can fit into a group.

19:42.160 --> 19:46.600
We are unique individual spirits.

19:46.800 --> 19:49.560
Genetically fingerprint,

19:49.760 --> 19:54.240
voice print in every fucking way, different from everybody else.

19:54.440 --> 20:01.000
And yet you want to goddamn belong, belong to the YMCA or swim.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.320
Don't belong to some some

20:04.520 --> 20:07.800
collective cult, because that's what the political parties are.

20:07.800 --> 20:13.880
They're cults, cults that says, yes, this is the truth.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.400
Guns are bad.

20:15.600 --> 20:18.840
Take them away from people or the other side.

20:19.040 --> 20:21.080
No, this is the truth.

20:21.280 --> 20:23.400
You have to defend yourself in life.

20:23.600 --> 20:25.960
There is no magic button you get to push.

20:26.160 --> 20:28.960
If someone broke into your house and is

20:29.160 --> 20:32.800
holding a gun to your head and are raping your wife and you want it to stop,

20:33.000 --> 20:37.040
press that magic button that makes the police appear between you and them.

20:37.040 --> 20:38.280
It doesn't exist.

20:38.480 --> 20:40.920
It's a fallacy, a dream.

20:41.120 --> 20:43.280
Police aren't here to protect you.

20:43.480 --> 20:44.400
What do they ever protect?

20:44.600 --> 20:49.120
No, they're here to clean up the mess after the crime has been done.

20:49.320 --> 20:52.480
So, I don't know, both sides got valid points.

20:52.680 --> 20:56.320
But why don't you choose for you?

20:56.520 --> 21:00.320
Not based on fear or what your parents did or what they taught you at school or

21:00.520 --> 21:04.720
what's right, because nobody knows what's right in this chaos.

21:04.720 --> 21:09.520
So the problem is the belonging to political

21:09.720 --> 21:16.560
parties in our political system that's causing the fucking chaos.

21:16.760 --> 21:17.640
I totally agree.

21:17.840 --> 21:19.760
And it's really interesting to me how this

21:19.960 --> 21:25.200
concept of delusion of objective reality keep coming up in this kind of a

21:25.200 --> 21:28.480
conversation, whether on this podcast or outside of it, that there is no such a

21:28.480 --> 21:32.280
thing as objective reality, there is no such a thing as objective truth or ethics

21:32.280 --> 21:36.880
and morality, just you on your own are responsible to find your own way.

21:37.080 --> 21:40.040
That's that's it, because you were

21:40.240 --> 21:42.680
did anybody hold your hand coming into this world?

21:42.680 --> 21:43.840
I'm talking about through the womb.

21:43.840 --> 21:45.520
Yeah, you got into the world and some

21:45.720 --> 21:49.920
doctors slapped you, started breathing, and at some point you became a person.

21:50.120 --> 21:50.600
OK, yes.

21:50.800 --> 21:52.840
But no, you were alone on this whole

21:53.040 --> 21:56.600
journey and you're going to be alone when you leave.

21:56.800 --> 21:58.880
Listen, I'm 74.

21:58.880 --> 22:04.160
The doorway that I must exit from is, I'm sure, visible to be in some direction

22:04.360 --> 22:09.680
if I look hard enough so I know when I leave here, no one's leaving with me.

22:09.880 --> 22:12.680
Yeah, it's just some labels that they put on you.

22:12.880 --> 22:18.560
Like I was born in Iran and I was one second old and automatically I was

22:18.760 --> 22:21.640
labeled as a Shia Muslim straight male Iranian.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.200
And good luck changing any of those.

22:24.200 --> 22:25.840
Some of them are punishable by death.

22:25.840 --> 22:29.160
Some of them you'll be alienated from your community and family.

22:29.360 --> 22:33.240
So I'm not saying that it's the worst in Iran or those countries.

22:33.440 --> 22:35.600
It's just the labels that I call them

22:35.800 --> 22:39.120
involuntary baggage that is being placed upon our shoulders.

22:39.320 --> 22:42.200
And we're forced to carry them for the rest of our lives.

22:42.400 --> 22:45.360
Well, I mean, listen, there's also benefits to those labels.

22:45.560 --> 22:48.160
I mean, for example, Shiite,

22:48.360 --> 22:54.840
one of the advantages to being a Shiite is your call to prayer is fucking beautiful.

22:54.840 --> 22:56.760
Compared to the rest of the Muslim world.

22:56.960 --> 22:59.880
And I know if you've heard it, no, you have.

23:00.080 --> 23:00.520
Yes.

23:00.720 --> 23:05.640
I mean, if there is a is there a song of greater longing,

23:05.840 --> 23:15.320
of greater need, of of greater depth than some of these calls to prayer sung out?

23:15.520 --> 23:17.600
Yeah, the problem is for a lot of people

23:17.800 --> 23:22.000
who grew up in those societies because that call and a lot of beautiful things

23:22.000 --> 23:26.120
about that culture, you know, like I love mosque architecture or what you're

23:26.320 --> 23:28.680
saying, some certain music that are coming, call of prayer.

23:28.880 --> 23:31.640
But it took me many, many years and many

23:31.840 --> 23:38.920
psychedelic experiences to be able to split ideology away from the artistic value

23:39.120 --> 23:43.200
and just appreciation of the concept, because if you grow up there,

23:43.400 --> 23:45.960
you're being persecuted on so many different levels.

23:46.160 --> 23:49.680
Every aspect of that society has become hated by you.

23:49.680 --> 23:54.240
Well, I have to differ, by the way, on the Muslim architecture and art.

23:54.440 --> 24:00.560
I think Muslim art stems from a negativity about what art can be.

24:00.760 --> 24:02.840
I mean, the shirt that you're wearing,

24:03.040 --> 24:05.760
that's representational of leaves to me.

24:05.960 --> 24:09.920
That's that's that's against the Muslim law.

24:10.120 --> 24:11.760
Is it not? Yes.

24:11.960 --> 24:14.320
You cannot have representational art.

24:14.520 --> 24:17.720
Absolutely. Pictures of people, no pictures of scenes.

24:17.720 --> 24:20.960
No, no, it's got to be art that's purely abstract.

24:21.160 --> 24:27.040
That's good. But one of the things I miss is the art in the Muslim world is,

24:27.240 --> 24:33.000
I don't know, seeing the human form, for example, painted by people like Picasso.

24:33.200 --> 24:35.520
Well, I mean, it's to me.

24:35.720 --> 24:36.960
There's the difference in art.

24:37.160 --> 24:42.200
However, in music, good God, man, the Shia call to prayer.

24:42.400 --> 24:45.080
Good Lord, that is

24:45.280 --> 24:46.880
heartrending and beautiful.

24:46.880 --> 24:48.880
Have you heard any any of the mornings

24:49.080 --> 24:53.600
of Shias, because I'm writing a book about my life and my life was changed

24:53.800 --> 24:58.320
completely for two, three years because of, you know, one dude with a microphone

24:58.520 --> 25:02.640
and a little bit of reverb singing those morning melodies.

25:02.840 --> 25:07.960
You know, it resonates with you so much that you are carried away with it.

25:08.160 --> 25:11.640
And I listen, I'm so ignorant of Muslim culture.

25:11.840 --> 25:14.440
I have to admit it that I know very little.

25:14.440 --> 25:18.400
I know the things that I like, that I've heard and seen, which is more I haven't.

25:18.400 --> 25:19.280
I'd love to hear it, though.

25:19.480 --> 25:22.840
And if after this, if you would send Janice a link to one of these,

25:23.040 --> 25:26.520
I promise you, I will listen to it and I think this is a good opportunity to say

25:26.720 --> 25:29.960
thanks to Janice for scheduling this interview as well.

25:30.160 --> 25:33.400
Janice, another thanks for scheduling this interview.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.880
OK, absolutely.

25:36.800 --> 25:38.080
She's the workhorse here.

25:38.080 --> 25:39.840
And without her, nothing would ever get done.

25:40.040 --> 25:44.040
That's awesome. She's been very kind and consistent and responding.

25:44.040 --> 25:48.040
And she is she's very good at responding and she's on the ball.

25:48.240 --> 25:51.960
I noticed last night I was looking at some of your information.

25:52.160 --> 25:55.720
You were born pretty much like two weeks after the end of World War Two.

25:55.920 --> 25:57.880
You were born in England, am I right?

25:58.080 --> 25:59.320
Yes, absolutely.

25:59.520 --> 26:04.440
How has the world changed from the perspective of you since

26:04.640 --> 26:06.440
right after World War Two to now?

26:06.440 --> 26:09.640
Because a lot of people are saying that we are moving beyond the order that was

26:09.640 --> 26:14.040
established after World War Two and things are being disrupted and being changed.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.520
I just want to experience this life

26:16.720 --> 26:21.600
that you've had from the perspective of the world that you've experienced.

26:22.680 --> 26:24.160
Well,

26:25.000 --> 26:27.160
there have been two changes,

26:27.360 --> 26:31.400
both of them interlinked, number one in politics

26:31.600 --> 26:34.840
and government. I grew up

26:35.040 --> 26:38.280
in 1950, I was five years old,

26:38.280 --> 26:40.520
1960,

26:40.720 --> 26:44.960
when Dwight Eisenhower left office, I was 15.

26:45.160 --> 26:46.440
So

26:47.200 --> 26:52.160
my teen years were spent in 1950s America, where

26:53.680 --> 26:56.720
the land of opportunity,

26:56.920 --> 26:59.320
the land of

26:59.840 --> 27:01.600
possibility,

27:01.800 --> 27:07.280
the land where anyone can become anything if you're willing to bear

27:07.280 --> 27:12.800
the burden of who you are with all of the negatives and positives of that,

27:13.000 --> 27:15.040
whether you're smart or dumb, black or white.

27:15.240 --> 27:18.640
And I admit back then blacks and anything

27:18.840 --> 27:23.480
other than whites were disadvantaged, that didn't stop

27:23.680 --> 27:30.240
many black people from taking advantage of the land of opportunity,

27:30.440 --> 27:32.840
given the realities of who you are.

27:33.040 --> 27:34.280
So

27:34.280 --> 27:36.680
it was like

27:36.880 --> 27:41.880
growing up with something I wanted, it was it was so beautiful.

27:41.880 --> 27:43.600
Now, at the same time, it's kind of plastic.

27:43.800 --> 27:46.600
Women had their place in the kitchen.

27:46.800 --> 27:49.840
Men had their place in the workforce.

27:50.040 --> 27:55.440
If you went to a doctor, they all smoked cigarettes while you were there.

27:55.640 --> 28:00.400
And if if you were hyper-tensive or something, they said,

28:00.600 --> 28:03.160
you need to smoke more.

28:03.160 --> 28:06.640
Cigarettes, try unfiltered camels.

28:06.840 --> 28:08.320
You get far more naked.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.800
I am serious.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.720
Doctors prescribed cigarettes.

28:12.920 --> 28:15.800
People were also smoking on planes, right?

28:16.000 --> 28:16.600
Oh, yes.

28:16.800 --> 28:20.360
And you smoked everywhere, airplanes, everywhere except church.

28:20.560 --> 28:21.160
All right.

28:21.360 --> 28:25.120
And that was, you know, that's because you're in church.

28:25.320 --> 28:29.400
You should not be distracted by anything that distracts you from God.

28:29.600 --> 28:30.680
But other than church,

28:30.680 --> 28:35.560
she's smoking fucking courthouses, courtrooms, courtrooms, had ashtrays,

28:35.760 --> 28:37.800
judges smoked.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.680
It was like

28:40.880 --> 28:42.880
it was that did have that aspect.

28:42.880 --> 28:44.160
And people go, that's kind of crazy.

28:44.160 --> 28:46.760
Well, yeah, but that's just what people believe back then.

28:46.960 --> 28:50.000
Different world, a different world.

28:50.200 --> 28:53.200
But in 1960, that all changed.

28:53.400 --> 28:59.600
When Eisenhower left office, you could feel something strange.

28:59.600 --> 29:01.600
The adults were unsettled.

29:01.800 --> 29:04.200
The teachers at school were unsettled.

29:04.400 --> 29:09.200
I mean, Eisenhower's exit speech was horrifying.

29:09.400 --> 29:12.400
I mean, one of the great U.S.

29:12.600 --> 29:17.680
presidents and one of the greatest generals of the past five centuries,

29:17.880 --> 29:21.720
the supreme allied commander during World War II.

29:21.920 --> 29:27.960
I mean, the man had balls of steel and a mind as sharp as a tack.

29:27.960 --> 29:29.720
And when he left, he said,

29:29.920 --> 29:36.680
if you do not beware, the CIA will take from America

29:36.880 --> 29:42.280
every freedom that we were birthed with.

29:42.480 --> 29:44.160
And that's exactly what happened.

29:44.360 --> 29:45.600
We were not beware.

29:45.800 --> 29:47.960
The next president,

29:49.400 --> 29:49.920
John F.

29:50.120 --> 29:51.600
Kennedy,

29:51.800 --> 29:54.440
made it his goal after he'd been in office for a while,

29:54.440 --> 29:58.640
he realized that Jesus God, the CIA is ruling everything.

29:58.840 --> 30:02.040
Said, I'm going to dismantle the CIA

30:02.240 --> 30:07.400
and take its pieces and hand them out to other covert agencies.

30:07.600 --> 30:14.640
One month later, he was accidentally shot in the head in Dallas, Texas.

30:14.840 --> 30:22.120
His brother, Robert Kennedy, at the next election ran for president

30:22.120 --> 30:29.280
under the banner, and he said, my main campaign promise is that if elected,

30:29.480 --> 30:33.040
I will dismantle the CIA.

30:33.240 --> 30:36.040
One month later, he was shot in the head.

30:36.240 --> 30:36.640
Wow.

30:36.840 --> 30:42.400
No president has ever challenged them since.

30:42.960 --> 30:46.440
So it doesn't matter who the president is before.

30:46.640 --> 30:48.320
You have to wake up to the fact that our

30:48.320 --> 30:52.520
government has been co-opted by covert agencies. Why?

30:52.720 --> 30:58.800
Because it has become clear that information is the only true power in this world.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.520
I mean, you think bombs and

31:01.720 --> 31:05.160
battleships and stealth bombers are the power.

31:05.360 --> 31:08.200
No, they operate on information.

31:08.400 --> 31:12.480
The handlers operate them based on information given to them.

31:12.680 --> 31:15.600
And who owns the information?

31:15.600 --> 31:18.880
You might think it's Google, Facebook, Twitter.

31:19.080 --> 31:23.440
No, the CIA owns the real information.

31:23.640 --> 31:28.560
Yeah, I was going to ask you, how do you see this balance or relationship

31:28.760 --> 31:33.400
between CIA and big tech companies considering how we are digitizing more

31:33.600 --> 31:38.600
and more aspects of our lives and data represents the smallest faction

31:38.600 --> 31:43.080
of information that we are gathering and analyzing and making sense out of?

31:43.080 --> 31:45.600
Well,

31:49.120 --> 31:52.400
there's two levels of information.

31:52.600 --> 31:54.680
There's the.

31:55.880 --> 31:57.920
The babble.

31:59.200 --> 32:02.680
Of a world full of people who are babbling,

32:02.880 --> 32:05.520
and Google owns that. How does they get it?

32:05.720 --> 32:10.560
They have spiders, they have these bots that just float around all over the world.

32:10.560 --> 32:13.040
Oh, there's a new website. See what's there.

32:13.240 --> 32:17.040
Look at all the pages, gather it together now.

32:17.240 --> 32:20.360
That's called the surface web.

32:20.560 --> 32:24.120
There are three webs. There's the surface web, what Google can see,

32:24.320 --> 32:29.200
which is all websites, OK, new stories, which we gather from websites,

32:29.400 --> 32:36.480
electronic data, trivial shit, which, while it may help us understand

32:36.480 --> 32:41.520
how Thomas Edison invented the light bulb, which he didn't,

32:41.720 --> 32:46.120
it's not going to help us very much in finding out what's in the mind

32:46.320 --> 32:51.160
of Iranian generals who might be planning an attack on U.S. soil.

32:51.360 --> 32:55.760
Google is not going to, neither is Facebook, neither is Twitter.

32:55.960 --> 33:00.800
So this is the realm of what's called the deep web.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.920
Now, deep web can be indexed for a bunch of reasons.

33:03.920 --> 33:08.280
Number one, it's either electronically organized,

33:08.480 --> 33:11.360
but you can't get into it without being a member.

33:11.560 --> 33:14.680
Like if you're a psychiatrist and you can prove you're a psychiatrist,

33:14.880 --> 33:19.120
you can get into psych.com. If you're not, you can't.

33:19.320 --> 33:23.360
Google cannot be everything and therefore cannot see what's happening there.

33:23.560 --> 33:25.760
That's part of the deep web.

33:25.960 --> 33:28.920
The other part is the non-electronic deep web.

33:29.120 --> 33:31.200
I'm still calling it the web.

33:31.200 --> 33:36.160
That information is gleaned by people who kidnap

33:36.360 --> 33:40.720
lieutenants from Iran and take them to Guantanamo and torture them.

33:40.920 --> 33:42.960
And so they think, pardon?

33:43.160 --> 33:44.840
Old school, you're right.

33:45.040 --> 33:48.680
Yeah, but that information,

33:48.880 --> 33:51.920
the value of that information, if you can validate it,

33:51.920 --> 33:54.160
we all know that under torture, people will tell you anything.

33:54.360 --> 33:58.480
But a good operative might be able to get some truth.

33:58.480 --> 34:03.000
That information is of extreme values,

34:03.200 --> 34:08.120
the diamonds of information compared to what Google has,

34:08.320 --> 34:12.280
which is the sandbox of information.

34:12.480 --> 34:15.680
So those are our three levels,

34:15.880 --> 34:19.400
the surface, which Google has, the deep web and electronic,

34:19.600 --> 34:24.120
which people have been trying to index for years and can't because you can't be

34:24.120 --> 34:28.560
a member of every secret product thing in the world.

34:28.760 --> 34:33.080
And then the old school information.

34:33.280 --> 34:35.640
I followed him to this address.

34:35.840 --> 34:40.120
He went in, changed clothes, came out in the disguise and went north.

34:40.320 --> 34:43.000
That information, that's the old school stuff.

34:43.200 --> 34:48.040
Or we tortured him for nine weeks and we kind of think this might be the truth,

34:48.240 --> 34:50.240
that information.

34:50.440 --> 34:53.280
The CIA controls all three.

34:53.280 --> 34:57.760
Google, you think the CIA does not have its thumbs in Google?

34:57.960 --> 34:59.720
Of course it does.

34:59.920 --> 35:06.160
It has its thumbs in any and every corporation that might be of value to it.

35:06.360 --> 35:11.240
The deep web, I promise you, if there is a private website,

35:11.440 --> 35:15.760
there is a CIA agent who has joined it with full credentials,

35:15.960 --> 35:18.240
even if it had to be made up.

35:18.440 --> 35:21.680
And the rest, the old school,

35:21.680 --> 35:28.480
only the CIA has that information and that is the information which is used to

35:28.680 --> 35:33.880
control presidents, congressmen and those who allegedly are in power.

35:34.080 --> 35:35.320
But they're not.

35:35.520 --> 35:37.680
We're living in an information age.

35:37.880 --> 35:39.920
And if you're talking about international

35:40.120 --> 35:44.680
relations, which is the stage upon which we float and survive,

35:44.880 --> 35:48.360
then the only people who can advise you at the CIA

35:48.360 --> 35:51.480
want to know what someone's thinking, the CIA will tell you.

35:51.680 --> 35:54.840
Problem is, they're going to tell you the truth that they want to tell you.

35:55.040 --> 36:00.280
And sometimes it's a lie, just like second Gulf War, Iraq has nuclear weapons.

36:00.480 --> 36:01.880
They're about to bomb England.

36:02.080 --> 36:02.960
Oh, really?

36:03.160 --> 36:05.880
Well, OK, I need to do something.

36:06.080 --> 36:07.320
So this is it.

36:07.520 --> 36:15.280
But even they require us, the people, to support them in what they're doing.

36:15.480 --> 36:17.800
Now, I'm not saying these are evil people.

36:17.800 --> 36:22.120
No, in some respects, I understand

36:22.320 --> 36:27.320
why they're doing what they're doing, because presidents are transients.

36:27.520 --> 36:29.760
Do you think we elect a president who's

36:29.960 --> 36:35.000
the smartest, who knows the most about the Middle East, China,

36:35.200 --> 36:42.200
North Korea, the subtleties of Vietnam and its neighbor Cambodia,

36:42.400 --> 36:44.520
what's happening with the Dalai Lama in Tibet?

36:44.720 --> 36:46.280
Fuck no.

36:46.280 --> 36:48.400
So you have to rely on advisors.

36:48.400 --> 36:49.280
Who are your advisors?

36:49.480 --> 36:53.720
The people who know who the CIA, the only ones who know.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.160
This is our tragedy.

36:55.360 --> 36:59.600
So they look at these idiots and they are

36:59.800 --> 37:08.440
every one idiot in terms of the CIA agent who spent 50 years of his life

37:08.640 --> 37:13.280
studying the nuances of the Muslim religion,

37:13.280 --> 37:19.640
the political alliances stretching back into antiquity, the culture,

37:19.840 --> 37:31.200
the system of marriage and love and managing the emotional chaos of the human being.

37:31.400 --> 37:35.600
No, they know nothing of this shit,

37:35.800 --> 37:43.000
not just in the Middle East, but in China, Nepal, in the Philippines, Venezuela.

37:43.000 --> 37:47.400
And so these idiots come in and they run the country.

37:47.400 --> 37:49.040
No, the CIA is not going to let that happen.

37:49.240 --> 37:49.920
Fuck no.

37:50.120 --> 37:52.600
We've got a plan that's been in place for 50 years.

37:52.800 --> 37:54.920
You are not fucking up that plan.

37:55.120 --> 37:56.640
Here's what you are allowed to do.

37:56.840 --> 37:58.800
Now, they don't tell this to the president.

37:59.000 --> 37:59.880
Of course not.

38:00.080 --> 38:02.120
Mr. President, you're a boss here.

38:02.320 --> 38:04.120
But no,

38:04.320 --> 38:05.920
no, you're not.

38:06.120 --> 38:08.880
You are a puppet and you will do what we say.

38:09.080 --> 38:10.440
You just don't know it yet.

38:10.440 --> 38:13.040
Would you say presidents are aware of this?

38:13.240 --> 38:14.720
No, they're not aware of it.

38:14.920 --> 38:18.280
They have no clue if they were nobody.

38:18.480 --> 38:20.280
I mean, no, of course not.

38:20.480 --> 38:23.960
Do you think Bush was aware he would be manipulated by the CIA

38:24.160 --> 38:26.040
when they said the rocks got nuclear weapons?

38:26.240 --> 38:27.360
Bomb them? No.

38:27.560 --> 38:30.760
But was he aware at the end of his eight years?

38:30.960 --> 38:32.280
No, no, no.

38:32.480 --> 38:36.520
Listen, the CIA is too good, too fucking good.

38:36.720 --> 38:38.920
No president knows this.

38:38.920 --> 38:41.760
I know this because

38:41.960 --> 38:48.240
the CIA was my first and largest customer and was remained my customer for years.

38:48.440 --> 38:50.240
I have good friends within it.

38:50.440 --> 38:55.160
Thank God it is as splintered as any other organization and bureaucracy.

38:55.360 --> 38:59.560
I mean, one part of the CIA was trying to collect me in the Bahamas and another part

38:59.760 --> 39:02.920
called me and said, they're coming for you at midnight tonight.

39:03.120 --> 39:06.080
Sure as hell, we left just before they came.

39:06.080 --> 39:08.960
They showed up, we were gone.

39:09.160 --> 39:10.320
Hmm.

39:10.520 --> 39:12.520
John, you're a cybersecurity legend.

39:12.720 --> 39:17.560
How well this country or individuals are taking care of their cybersecurity in this

39:17.760 --> 39:20.520
day and age? We have known people.

39:20.720 --> 39:22.280
We haven't had any for 10 years.

39:22.480 --> 39:24.160
People buy antivirus software.

39:24.360 --> 39:25.480
It's useless.

39:25.680 --> 39:27.000
It's useless.

39:27.200 --> 39:28.800
The world has changed.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.920
Nobody uses technology anymore.

39:31.120 --> 39:33.840
Social engineering is how things are hacked.

39:33.840 --> 39:39.280
Why? Why should I go to the trouble of writing sophisticated software to break

39:39.480 --> 39:46.400
into your system when I can have a very clever neuro-linguistic programmer type

39:46.600 --> 39:51.280
to sit out in the car and watch people come and go with badges and figure out who

39:51.480 --> 39:56.160
is the secretary of the CEO who has everyone's passport, of course.

39:56.360 --> 39:57.400
Is she married? Is she not?

39:57.600 --> 40:02.280
Doesn't matter because even married, if the right person comes along,

40:02.280 --> 40:08.560
you will slip and perhaps make a mistake that you may regret later.

40:08.760 --> 40:11.520
But once you've slipped, you've slipped.

40:11.720 --> 40:16.600
And that bastard you slipped for over the next few months is going to find out

40:16.600 --> 40:18.240
everything about you pretty soon.

40:18.240 --> 40:20.040
He's got everybody's passwords.

40:20.240 --> 40:23.480
She doesn't even know it because the first thing he does is plant software on her

40:23.480 --> 40:32.160
phone while she's sleeping after he has loved her into some ambulance.

40:32.360 --> 40:33.680
He's got access to your phone.

40:33.880 --> 40:34.720
Your phone is tapped.

40:34.920 --> 40:37.080
Everyone is listening and watching pretty soon.

40:37.280 --> 40:38.920
We're in.

40:39.120 --> 40:44.800
Why bother spending two years writing sophisticated software when I can

40:45.000 --> 40:47.320
fuck a secretary?

40:47.520 --> 40:51.160
And this is happening in United States and in China and in Japan and in Europe and

40:51.160 --> 40:57.000
all over the place, wherever there are men and women.

40:57.200 --> 41:02.680
This is the oldest trick and game in the world by friend, you know,

41:02.880 --> 41:04.760
boy meets girl.

41:04.960 --> 41:07.240
The problem is,

41:07.440 --> 41:10.880
do we always know where the girl came from?

41:11.080 --> 41:13.880
Is she being paid to be with you?

41:14.080 --> 41:17.000
And people in my position, I have to think of that, right?

41:17.000 --> 41:21.200
So amazing.

41:21.400 --> 41:23.360
That's one more question, my friend.

41:23.560 --> 41:27.400
OK, let me ask you the last question that I ask all my guests then,

41:27.600 --> 41:32.080
that if you come across an intelligent alien from a different civilization,

41:32.280 --> 41:34.920
what would you say is the worst thing humanity has done?

41:35.120 --> 41:38.280
And what would you say is their greatest achievement?

41:38.480 --> 41:40.680
I'm telling this to the alien.

41:40.880 --> 41:41.720
Sure.

41:41.920 --> 41:45.960
As a representative of the human race.

41:45.960 --> 41:48.040
I don't think I'd tell a jack shit,

41:48.240 --> 41:53.120
because if you can't trust your own species, how the hell can you trust an alien?

41:53.320 --> 41:55.040
I mean, I'm being honest with you now.

41:55.240 --> 41:58.720
The best thing you can ever do is tell nobody anything, right?

41:58.920 --> 42:00.200
You don't know who they are.

42:00.400 --> 42:04.480
No, basically, I would fill his mind with disinformation.

42:04.680 --> 42:07.480
I would go, we are a peaceful race.

42:07.680 --> 42:09.120
We are unarmed.

42:09.320 --> 42:11.920
We have no weapons of any kind.

42:12.120 --> 42:13.080
We eat fruit.

42:13.080 --> 42:17.000
We don't kill animals and only fruit has fallen off the trees.

42:17.200 --> 42:18.760
We live in utter peace.

42:18.960 --> 42:23.560
No one has ever struck another human being or harmed them in any

42:23.760 --> 42:25.040
unbecoming shit like that.

42:25.240 --> 42:30.520
Meanwhile, thinking, how do I get my data back home about what I'm trying to find

42:30.720 --> 42:34.680
out about this mobile? The world is a dangerous place.

42:34.880 --> 42:39.680
I would anticipate that the universe outside our earth is equally as dangerous.

42:39.680 --> 42:43.880
And I would look upon that alien with the utmost distrust.

42:44.080 --> 42:48.560
Now, if it were human like and female and had a really beautiful ass,

42:48.760 --> 42:54.880
I might also explain that the way that we show our peace is by something we call

42:54.880 --> 42:58.280
making love. And if you'll please get up to rest, I will show you how we do that.

42:58.480 --> 43:00.120
But beyond that,

43:00.320 --> 43:03.760
that would be open to mention best, all right?

43:03.960 --> 43:05.000
Thank you very much.

43:05.000 --> 43:09.760
Thank you so much, John. It was a pleasure.
