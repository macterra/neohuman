1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
Did anybody hold your hand coming into this world?

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,600
I'm talking about through the womb.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,120
Yeah, you got into the world and some doctor slapped you.

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,720
You started breathing.

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,680
And at some point you became a person.

6
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,360
OK, yes.

7
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,600
But no, you were alone on this whole

8
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,960
journey and you're going to be alone when you leave.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,760
Hello and welcome to the 62nd episode of Neohuman podcast.

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,240
I'm the Mugabahari etygologist on Twitter and Instagram.

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,000
And you can follow this show on LiveInLimbo.com, iTunes, YouTube and Bitshoot.

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,920
And with me, I have the pleasure of having the one and only John McAfee.

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,760
Welcome to Neohuman podcast, John.

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,200
Hey, well, thanks for having me on.

15
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,440
Absolutely. Absolute pleasure.

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,160
Why don't we start with you?

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,760
I'm going to be I'm going to be doing tequila shooters.

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,040
Oh, fantastic.

19
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,760
With wine chasers while we're doing this, if you don't mind.

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,920
I don't mind no disrespect whatsoever.

21
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,520
No, but it is taken.

22
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,840
It's late evening for me.

23
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,600
I'm in a part of the world where it's it's late and a man, especially a man of 74,

24
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,880
should be relaxing with wine and tequila.

25
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,560
So I'm doing that while we're talking.

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,640
Fantastic.

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,400
Fantastic.

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,360
So which part of the world are you located now?

29
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,080
If I could tell you, I would.

30
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,840
OK, fair enough.

31
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,840
OK, it's interesting.

32
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,760
Nobody or even our closest family has no clue where we are.

33
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,640
OK, right.

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,360
Not our children, Janice's brothers and sisters, nobody knows where we are.

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,400
Is this due to the problems with the government?

36
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,720
And I'm saying it because of the tweet that I saw you sending today,

37
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,840
which I want to mention for our audience because it gives a very good context about

38
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,240
where you stand perspective wise and worldview wise with respect to government

39
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,720
that you have said, I am at war with my government.

40
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,880
It was intended to represent this great

41
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,840
nation of profound beauty, bordered by two vast and different oceans,

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,960
a nation which nourished and nurtured me.

43
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,640
Instead, it is a parasite on the very

44
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,800
precious thing that it was intended to watch over.

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,040
Yeah, well, no, there's no no secret.

46
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,240
I've been at war with the U.S. government

47
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,760
and moving on the run from the U.S.

48
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:19,520
government since January of 2019 when the IRS convened a grand jury

49
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,920
to charge Janice and I with tax fraud.

50
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,560
Now, it's also no secret I have not paid taxes for 10 years.

51
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,880
I refuse. I will not ever pay taxes again.

52
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,760
Taxation is theft.

53
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,960
We didn't have it prior to 1913 in America.

54
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,760
And America was at that time the industrial giant of the world with no taxes.

55
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,840
People go, how do we fund the government?

56
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,800
Do some research, people.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,800
Taxation has merely made us go from an

58
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,600
industrial giant to a country that manufactures nothing anymore

59
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,240
other than war machines.

60
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,480
What's going to happen when someone kicks our ass once and someone will?

61
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,520
So we have got to straighten up and taxation is theft and it's killing us.

62
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,640
So I don't pay it. Now, for eight years, they left me alone.

63
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,720
Well, I've already paid 50 million dollars, over 50 million dollars in taxes in my life.

64
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,760
I promise you, people, I have not received 50 million dollars in services.

65
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,480
So I'm not paying anymore.

66
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,680
Now, two years ago, I started speaking on the national stage about you don't want

67
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,760
to pay taxes either, use privacy coins like Monero and distributed

68
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,840
exchanges, and no one will ever know what your income or expenses are.

69
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:46,000
Now, I live in a community of tens of thousands of people around the world.

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,160
Many of them crypto leaders like Brock Pearson do not use cash.

71
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,520
We don't use fiat currency.

72
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,040
When I take a job, if you can't pay me in crypto, then I'm not working for you.

73
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,480
And if I want to buy something and you won't sell it to me in crypto, then I don't

74
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,120
need it because there's nothing you can't buy.

75
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,600
Houses, cars, clothes, bulletproof vest, shoes, food.

76
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:14,640
When we went silent, OK, so Janice and I, back to the story,

77
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,520
we were chased all across the Caribbean.

78
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,880
Finally, we got arrested in the Dominican Republic, who insisted we had to go back

79
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,840
to America. This is after Belize?

80
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,800
This is seven months ago, my friend.

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,160
Yes.

82
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,800
Yeah, no, we were in jail in the Dominican Republic for four days.

83
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,040
Finally, I got legal representation

84
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,840
and because we were arrested illegally, everybody knew this, but it didn't really

85
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,680
matter to them because they're just going to ship me back to the States and it'll all

86
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,480
be forgotten. No, I'm not letting it be forgotten.

87
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,920
I got my lawyers to file a brief with the

88
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,320
Supreme Court in the Dominican Republic demanding I simply get a hearing.

89
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,800
Now, they have to do that.

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,520
They have to.

91
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,080
As soon as the paper was filed, we got out of jail and went to the VIP.

92
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,240
They took us to the VIP lounge in the Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.

93
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,400
And we were served by people with white

94
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:22,440
gloves, champagne and caviar, along with heads of state who happened to be visiting.

95
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,840
Now, that shift simply because I refused to roll fucking over.

96
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,920
And so I did.

97
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,160
Now, that was in July.

98
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,240
So now they so we went to the Bahamas first as we took a boat to the Bahamas.

99
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,360
The Bahamian government tried to arrest us.

100
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,800
We found out about it in advance and left

101
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,320
and went to Cuba. We were there for a month and a half.

102
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,200
And the Cuban government called Janice and I in and said,

103
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:55,120
the United States government has demanded that we either we turn you to America.

104
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,120
Or expel you from our country.

105
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,800
And we know you're a friend of Cuba.

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,720
We're not going to return you to America.

107
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,040
We know what would happen to you,

108
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,200
but we do have to ask you to leave our country within 72 hours, which we did

109
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,960
four days at sea, sailed into the Dominican Republic and were arrested before we even

110
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,480
got into port and said, you have to go back to America.

111
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,320
So on the airplane to London, this is after we got out of jail.

112
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,520
I said, honey, we can't keep this up.

113
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,520
We can't run forever.

114
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,800
We have to go into hiding.

115
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,360
So we did in London.

116
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,640
We got there on a weekend.

117
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,560
So I knew had it been a weekday, I would have gotten arrested.

118
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,160
I know this, but it was a weekend.

119
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,760
So the paperwork of the U.S. State Department has to file with the London,

120
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,400
with the UK State Department, they have to get a court order.

121
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,840
It takes days.

122
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,000
So I knew we're safe.

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,080
We spent one night in London, went underground and no one knows where we are now.

124
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,800
Wow.

125
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,320
And yet you are still running for president of the United States in 2020.

126
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,680
Sure. Why not?

127
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,680
So what what are the biggest obstacles you consider in front of this great country?

128
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,760
Otherwise great country United States that you would want to tackle?

129
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,840
I know that you are very driven by disruption to the entire system.

130
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,400
And that's very well understood considering your position.

131
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:24,880
But what other obstacles or shortcomings or main obstacles and shortcomings do you

132
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,080
consider coming from the government that you want to disrupt or change fundamentally?

133
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,400
Well, there's only one and we have to change it or we're all dead.

134
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,200
And that is we have to wake up to the fact that it doesn't matter who the president

135
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,160
is, that our two party system is a charade designed to keep us focused.

136
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,680
And how do you get people focused and and agitated?

137
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,600
Well, you you you create sides or two sides.

138
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
There's the left and there's the right.

139
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,360
There's the right. There's the wrong.

140
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,320
There's the liberal and there's the

141
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,480
conservatives and the gun owners and the gun haters. There are the social

142
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,760
progressives and the conservative take care of yourselves.

143
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:17,000
Well, there's plenty of shit there to create a tension between two groups of

144
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,320
people, pretty much evenly divided, right?

145
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,040
And that was perfect.

146
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,520
Whoever played that out and made that happen.

147
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,080
Brilliant. And we know who they were. It's the CIA.

148
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,160
The CIA controls America, people.

149
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,600
If you think otherwise, then

150
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,240
you're not thinking.

151
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,480
I mean, who controls the information flow?

152
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,520
And and who?

153
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:48,440
Because, first of all, the CIA calls presidents transients,

154
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,800
transients, and they're there for four years, eight, Max and they're gone.

155
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,040
And we have to train another new one.

156
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,160
They don't bother training anymore.

157
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,920
They just control them through information flow.

158
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,120
Let me give you an example of second Gulf War.

159
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,160
The CIA king, I don't know what they call

160
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:12,120
themselves, probably not emperor of Middle East, whoever that may have been,

161
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,480
decided that he wanted Iraq removed as a power.

162
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,760
Apparently they weren't playing according to the plan.

163
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,960
And so he called Washington and said, I want them bombed into oblivion.

164
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,080
I want it done tomorrow.

165
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,880
Are we clear? It's fucking with my plans.

166
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,560
So Washington, their job is to make sure all of their kings and emperors and

167
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,560
princes around the world are productive and doing what they want.

168
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,920
It says, OK, all right, attend, Larry.

169
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,560
We have to bomb Iraq tomorrow.

170
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,440
You know, the president make it happen.

171
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,240
And you get the team, the Congress team together and let them know what's

172
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,760
happening and the guys go, OK, do we have free rein?

173
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,720
Yes. Do what you have to do.

174
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,840
They walked into the president's office and said, Mr. President,

175
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,960
I regret to tell you, please, Mr. President, sit down.

176
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,480
There is a matter of the gravest,

177
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,760
both national and international urgency that we must make you aware of.

178
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,960
Iraq has nuclear weapons

179
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,960
and missile capabilities, double people,

180
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,480
pardon, WMDs, right, nuclear weapons and

181
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,960
missile capabilities capable of delivering them to our closest ally, England.

182
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,760
And, sir, we have news that perhaps as soon as tomorrow

183
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,640
that there might be a nuclear blast over London.

184
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,240
Now, sir, it's not our job to advise you.

185
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,160
No, no, we are simply here to inform you about the facts of life.

186
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,640
And I'm sorry.

187
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,400
Now, what choice did Bush have?

188
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,320
None. And he said, sir, again,

189
00:10:54,520 --> 00:11:00,800
if something is not done to stop them by tomorrow, it will be too late.

190
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,880
Four hours later, our stealth bombers

191
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:12,880
eradicated the Iraqi military and the leveled bunch of Baghdad.

192
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,800
And in the next few months, bomb them into the Stone Age, like the CIA prince

193
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,280
or whoever he's called of the Middle East wanted.

194
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,560
This is how it works, people.

195
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,200
And you only have to lie.

196
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,440
You can tell the truth.

197
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,800
And by the way, we all knew there were no nuclear weapons in Iraq.

198
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,760
The American people knew.

199
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,760
Certainly everybody in Europe knew and all the Middle East knew.

200
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,080
Who didn't know the president and Congress

201
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,680
because they were briefed by the people who knew the CIA.

202
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,600
So this is how it works.

203
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,000
The president's got no power.

204
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,200
It doesn't matter if Trump or Hillary Clinton or a derelict from the street

205
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,840
or your pet dog is elected president, nothing will change in this country.

206
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,200
And if if you don't want to accept these words,

207
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,880
I mean, if you're over 21 and have lived through more than one election,

208
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,640
you will have noticed one thing, nothing in your life changed.

209
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,920
No more or less beer in the refrigerator.

210
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,280
Your wife is still with you, still got your job.

211
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,480
Nothing changes in your life when we change presidents.

212
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,360
Can't you see those people?

213
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,360
And so my job is not to be elected because I don't want the job.

214
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,320
No one should want that job if it has any sense.

215
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,760
And yet presidents don't even know they're being manipulated.

216
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,880
No, my job is to try to wake people up to the fact that those in power,

217
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:45,840
both the puppets and the puppet masters, are standing on your shoulders.

218
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:51,160
It is the fruits of your labor, your creativity, your work,

219
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:58,120
the sweat of your brow that supports the consumption of this corrupt government.

220
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,000
So all you got to do, people, is shrug.

221
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,240
Step across the line into a world where we don't use money anymore.

222
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,400
Good God, people, that's an unnecessary thing in cryptocurrency.

223
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,760
If you can't pay me in crypto, specifically Monero, then I'm not working for you.

224
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,280
And if I can't buy something in crypto, then I don't need it

225
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,360
because you can buy everything, cars, clothes.

226
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,520
When it went to London, when we were deported,

227
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,920
we went to a crypto-only hotel, beautiful, big-ass hotel in London, right?

228
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:40,440
Food, the service, the room, the cleaning, the phone calls, all with crypto.

229
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,840
Yeah, I want to talk about crypto.

230
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,520
But before that, what you mentioned about the process leading to the Iraq War,

231
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,360
it reminded me of the process that basically banks forced the president

232
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,720
and the U.S. government to bail them out after the 2009 crash.

233
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,480
Hank Paulson and Bernanke go into the president's office and demanding the bailout,

234
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,680
saying that if we don't get this amount of money, the entire economy of the world

235
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,600
is going to collapse within a day.

236
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,440
Well, yeah, keep in mind,

237
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,320
presidents don't just have one puppet master.

238
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,560
They got a thousand strings that control them.

239
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,720
The Fed is one of those.

240
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,280
So the Secret Service is one of those.

241
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,720
The military covert intelligence is one.

242
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,720
The CIA is the big one.

243
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,600
No, presidents have thousands of strings.

244
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,880
The Fed is one of those.

245
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,640
And that was Fed going, OK,

246
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,840
bail these bastards out.

247
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,560
It's not my interest for this to be happening.

248
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,720
Are there strings ultimately coming from a unified kind of a big picture or no?

249
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,160
They're just I wish I wish it was.

250
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,400
Wouldn't that be an easy solution?

251
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,800
This is going to remove that motherfucker forever.

252
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
No, it's not.

253
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,000
It is a totalitarian

254
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,280
distributed system.

255
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,080
Not decentralized, but deceptive.

256
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,040
And so who the fuck knows who's at top?

257
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,080
It varies.

258
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:11,120
CIA is always number one or number two because they are the global

259
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,320
intelligence agency of the world.

260
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,800
And scary people, and they're the ones that be chasing me.

261
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,200
And also, they were my biggest client for years.

262
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,000
And I have good friends within the CIA,

263
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,440
but even within the CIA, it's not a unified organism.

264
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,840
It's broken into factions.

265
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,080
I mean, the CIA is arranging with Paul

266
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:37,600
Rowe of the Bahamas to get me arrested so I can be deported back to the state.

267
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,760
And another branch of the CIA is calling me to tell me about it,

268
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,680
which is how we got out of the country just before they came.

269
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,720
And unfortunately, they didn't tell me about the Dominican Republic.

270
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,680
We ended up in jail there.

271
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,720
So this has been our life.

272
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,560
We've been on the run for seven and a half years, seven and a half, maybe.

273
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,120
Yes, seven and a half years.

274
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,040
And during that time, we had been chased,

275
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:10,160
shot at, chased at one hundred and twenty miles an hour on back roads of Arizona.

276
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,840
People dressed in fake police uniforms storming our apartment complex in Portland,

277
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:22,440
Oregon in 2013, September 2013.

278
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,640
This has been our life.

279
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,880
This is how we live, people. Why?

280
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,240
Because I refuse to shut up.

281
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,160
Which is which is exactly what most people don't do, even with your situation

282
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,120
and others like you, like with the Sanj, for example,

283
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,000
a lot of people without knowing much about what is going on, they're like, well,

284
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,040
they must have done something wrong for being chased by the government because

285
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,760
they just don't want to be involved in any of it.

286
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,200
You know, it's just insane.

287
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,160
I mean, that's what that sheep think, right, right, which is fine.

288
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,240
But they vote.

289
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,960
Yeah, OK.

290
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,360
But fortunately, it doesn't matter who they elect, right?

291
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,280
Because most of the sheep don't know what's happening.

292
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,640
So but at some point,

293
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,960
the sheep have to be woken up if you're going to move camp, for example,

294
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,520
or get them out of the of harm's way from hungry wolves.

295
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,880
And when sheep get unsettled, well,

296
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:25,280
crazy things happen, they panic, they start running in strange directions.

297
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,000
The shepherds

298
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:32,200
are at their wits end trying to figure out how we're going to get these motherfuckers

299
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,600
back into a safe place.

300
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,040
So that's what the CIA doesn't want.

301
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,520
That's why the CIA refuses to allow change.

302
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,200
They don't want a president, but they let Obama go ahead, build Obamacare.

303
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,120
They didn't give a shit.

304
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,400
We'll tear it down to the next administration.

305
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,600
And they did. It's gone.

306
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:55,920
Four years of that man's life and trillions of our dollars down the tubes.

307
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,000
Trump wanted a wall between Mexico

308
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,640
and the United States.

309
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,440
That was almost four years ago.

310
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,480
How much was built?

311
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,920
Ninety three miles.

312
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,560
Ninety two of those miles merely repaired the existing wall.

313
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,760
Nothing changes.

314
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,520
We understand people.

315
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,960
So stop worrying about that.

316
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,240
Why do you care about things that don't matter?

317
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,640
Who cares if a Republican or a Democrat?

318
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,120
The problem is, is that you identify with a group.

319
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,600
You are either a Democrat or a Republican.

320
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,480
You either love guns or you hate guns.

321
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,920
Well, who gives a shit?

322
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:40,080
Does that mean you must align yourself with others who also think like you?

323
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:46,920
God, what a horror of a world it would be if that was what everybody did.

324
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,360
We would have violence in the streets.

325
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:55,040
We would shoot each other from our automobiles, which we do sometimes.

326
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,680
In a lot of parts of the world, that's exactly what's happening.

327
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,440
This tribalism.

328
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:07,920
Yes, but that's that's a regression of human society, culture and spirit.

329
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,400
You don't.

330
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,400
Stop identifying with groups.

331
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,560
Stop wanting to belong.

332
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:22,160
Stop wanting others to validate your feelings, thoughts, perceptions and beliefs.

333
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,200
Because if they need validating, they are not valid.

334
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,800
Be yourself.

335
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,480
Stand alone for one thing, the truth of your life as you see it,

336
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,240
because there is no group that you will fit into.

337
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,160
Nobody can fit into a group.

338
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,600
We are unique individual spirits.

339
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,560
Genetically fingerprint,

340
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,240
voice print in every fucking way, different from everybody else.

341
00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:01,000
And yet you want to goddamn belong, belong to the YMCA or swim.

342
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,320
Don't belong to some some

343
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,800
collective cult, because that's what the political parties are.

344
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:13,880
They're cults, cults that says, yes, this is the truth.

345
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,400
Guns are bad.

346
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,840
Take them away from people or the other side.

347
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,080
No, this is the truth.

348
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,400
You have to defend yourself in life.

349
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,960
There is no magic button you get to push.

350
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,960
If someone broke into your house and is

351
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,800
holding a gun to your head and are raping your wife and you want it to stop,

352
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,040
press that magic button that makes the police appear between you and them.

353
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,280
It doesn't exist.

354
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,920
It's a fallacy, a dream.

355
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,280
Police aren't here to protect you.

356
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,400
What do they ever protect?

357
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,120
No, they're here to clean up the mess after the crime has been done.

358
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,480
So, I don't know, both sides got valid points.

359
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,320
But why don't you choose for you?

360
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,320
Not based on fear or what your parents did or what they taught you at school or

361
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,720
what's right, because nobody knows what's right in this chaos.

362
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,520
So the problem is the belonging to political

363
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:16,560
parties in our political system that's causing the fucking chaos.

364
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,640
I totally agree.

365
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,760
And it's really interesting to me how this

366
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:25,200
concept of delusion of objective reality keep coming up in this kind of a

367
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,480
conversation, whether on this podcast or outside of it, that there is no such a

368
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,280
thing as objective reality, there is no such a thing as objective truth or ethics

369
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:36,880
and morality, just you on your own are responsible to find your own way.

370
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,040
That's that's it, because you were

371
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,680
did anybody hold your hand coming into this world?

372
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,840
I'm talking about through the womb.

373
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,520
Yeah, you got into the world and some

374
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,920
doctors slapped you, started breathing, and at some point you became a person.

375
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,600
OK, yes.

376
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,840
But no, you were alone on this whole

377
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,600
journey and you're going to be alone when you leave.

378
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,880
Listen, I'm 74.

379
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,160
The doorway that I must exit from is, I'm sure, visible to be in some direction

380
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:09,680
if I look hard enough so I know when I leave here, no one's leaving with me.

381
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,680
Yeah, it's just some labels that they put on you.

382
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,560
Like I was born in Iran and I was one second old and automatically I was

383
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,640
labeled as a Shia Muslim straight male Iranian.

384
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,200
And good luck changing any of those.

385
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,840
Some of them are punishable by death.

386
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,160
Some of them you'll be alienated from your community and family.

387
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,240
So I'm not saying that it's the worst in Iran or those countries.

388
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,600
It's just the labels that I call them

389
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,120
involuntary baggage that is being placed upon our shoulders.

390
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,200
And we're forced to carry them for the rest of our lives.

391
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,360
Well, I mean, listen, there's also benefits to those labels.

392
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,160
I mean, for example, Shiite,

393
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:54,840
one of the advantages to being a Shiite is your call to prayer is fucking beautiful.

394
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,760
Compared to the rest of the Muslim world.

395
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,880
And I know if you've heard it, no, you have.

396
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,520
Yes.

397
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,640
I mean, if there is a is there a song of greater longing,

398
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:15,320
of greater need, of of greater depth than some of these calls to prayer sung out?

399
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,600
Yeah, the problem is for a lot of people

400
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:22,000
who grew up in those societies because that call and a lot of beautiful things

401
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,120
about that culture, you know, like I love mosque architecture or what you're

402
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,680
saying, some certain music that are coming, call of prayer.

403
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,640
But it took me many, many years and many

404
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:38,920
psychedelic experiences to be able to split ideology away from the artistic value

405
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,200
and just appreciation of the concept, because if you grow up there,

406
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,960
you're being persecuted on so many different levels.

407
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,680
Every aspect of that society has become hated by you.

408
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:54,240
Well, I have to differ, by the way, on the Muslim architecture and art.

409
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:00,560
I think Muslim art stems from a negativity about what art can be.

410
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,840
I mean, the shirt that you're wearing,

411
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,760
that's representational of leaves to me.

412
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,920
That's that's that's against the Muslim law.

413
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,760
Is it not? Yes.

414
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,320
You cannot have representational art.

415
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,720
Absolutely. Pictures of people, no pictures of scenes.

416
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,960
No, no, it's got to be art that's purely abstract.

417
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:27,040
That's good. But one of the things I miss is the art in the Muslim world is,

418
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:33,000
I don't know, seeing the human form, for example, painted by people like Picasso.

419
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,520
Well, I mean, it's to me.

420
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,960
There's the difference in art.

421
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:42,200
However, in music, good God, man, the Shia call to prayer.

422
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,080
Good Lord, that is

423
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,880
heartrending and beautiful.

424
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,880
Have you heard any any of the mornings

425
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:53,600
of Shias, because I'm writing a book about my life and my life was changed

426
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:58,320
completely for two, three years because of, you know, one dude with a microphone

427
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,640
and a little bit of reverb singing those morning melodies.

428
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,960
You know, it resonates with you so much that you are carried away with it.

429
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,640
And I listen, I'm so ignorant of Muslim culture.

430
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,440
I have to admit it that I know very little.

431
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,400
I know the things that I like, that I've heard and seen, which is more I haven't.

432
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,280
I'd love to hear it, though.

433
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,840
And if after this, if you would send Janice a link to one of these,

434
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,520
I promise you, I will listen to it and I think this is a good opportunity to say

435
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,960
thanks to Janice for scheduling this interview as well.

436
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,400
Janice, another thanks for scheduling this interview.

437
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,880
OK, absolutely.

438
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,080
She's the workhorse here.

439
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,840
And without her, nothing would ever get done.

440
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:44,040
That's awesome. She's been very kind and consistent and responding.

441
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,040
And she is she's very good at responding and she's on the ball.

442
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,960
I noticed last night I was looking at some of your information.

443
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,720
You were born pretty much like two weeks after the end of World War Two.

444
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,880
You were born in England, am I right?

445
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,320
Yes, absolutely.

446
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,440
How has the world changed from the perspective of you since

447
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,440
right after World War Two to now?

448
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,640
Because a lot of people are saying that we are moving beyond the order that was

449
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,040
established after World War Two and things are being disrupted and being changed.

450
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,520
I just want to experience this life

451
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,600
that you've had from the perspective of the world that you've experienced.

452
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,160
Well,

453
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,160
there have been two changes,

454
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,400
both of them interlinked, number one in politics

455
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,840
and government. I grew up

456
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,280
in 1950, I was five years old,

457
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,520
1960,

458
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,960
when Dwight Eisenhower left office, I was 15.

459
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,440
So

460
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,160
my teen years were spent in 1950s America, where

461
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,720
the land of opportunity,

462
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,320
the land of

463
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,600
possibility,

464
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:07,280
the land where anyone can become anything if you're willing to bear

465
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:12,800
the burden of who you are with all of the negatives and positives of that,

466
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,040
whether you're smart or dumb, black or white.

467
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,640
And I admit back then blacks and anything

468
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,480
other than whites were disadvantaged, that didn't stop

469
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:30,240
many black people from taking advantage of the land of opportunity,

470
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,840
given the realities of who you are.

471
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,280
So

472
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,680
it was like

473
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,880
growing up with something I wanted, it was it was so beautiful.

474
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,600
Now, at the same time, it's kind of plastic.

475
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,600
Women had their place in the kitchen.

476
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,840
Men had their place in the workforce.

477
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:55,440
If you went to a doctor, they all smoked cigarettes while you were there.

478
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,400
And if if you were hyper-tensive or something, they said,

479
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,160
you need to smoke more.

480
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,640
Cigarettes, try unfiltered camels.

481
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,320
You get far more naked.

482
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,800
I am serious.

483
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,720
Doctors prescribed cigarettes.

484
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,800
People were also smoking on planes, right?

485
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,600
Oh, yes.

486
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,360
And you smoked everywhere, airplanes, everywhere except church.

487
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,160
All right.

488
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,120
And that was, you know, that's because you're in church.

489
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,400
You should not be distracted by anything that distracts you from God.

490
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,680
But other than church,

491
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:35,560
she's smoking fucking courthouses, courtrooms, courtrooms, had ashtrays,

492
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,800
judges smoked.

493
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,680
It was like

494
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,880
it was that did have that aspect.

495
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,160
And people go, that's kind of crazy.

496
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,760
Well, yeah, but that's just what people believe back then.

497
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,000
Different world, a different world.

498
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,200
But in 1960, that all changed.

499
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:59,600
When Eisenhower left office, you could feel something strange.

500
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,600
The adults were unsettled.

501
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,200
The teachers at school were unsettled.

502
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:09,200
I mean, Eisenhower's exit speech was horrifying.

503
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,400
I mean, one of the great U.S.

504
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:17,680
presidents and one of the greatest generals of the past five centuries,

505
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,720
the supreme allied commander during World War II.

506
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:27,960
I mean, the man had balls of steel and a mind as sharp as a tack.

507
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,720
And when he left, he said,

508
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:36,680
if you do not beware, the CIA will take from America

509
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,280
every freedom that we were birthed with.

510
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,160
And that's exactly what happened.

511
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,600
We were not beware.

512
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,960
The next president,

513
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:49,920
John F.

514
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,600
Kennedy,

515
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,440
made it his goal after he'd been in office for a while,

516
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,640
he realized that Jesus God, the CIA is ruling everything.

517
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,040
Said, I'm going to dismantle the CIA

518
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,400
and take its pieces and hand them out to other covert agencies.

519
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:14,640
One month later, he was accidentally shot in the head in Dallas, Texas.

520
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:22,120
His brother, Robert Kennedy, at the next election ran for president

521
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:29,280
under the banner, and he said, my main campaign promise is that if elected,

522
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,040
I will dismantle the CIA.

523
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,040
One month later, he was shot in the head.

524
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:36,640
Wow.

525
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:42,400
No president has ever challenged them since.

526
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,440
So it doesn't matter who the president is before.

527
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,320
You have to wake up to the fact that our

528
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,520
government has been co-opted by covert agencies. Why?

529
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,800
Because it has become clear that information is the only true power in this world.

530
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,520
I mean, you think bombs and

531
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,160
battleships and stealth bombers are the power.

532
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,200
No, they operate on information.

533
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,480
The handlers operate them based on information given to them.

534
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,600
And who owns the information?

535
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,880
You might think it's Google, Facebook, Twitter.

536
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,440
No, the CIA owns the real information.

537
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:28,560
Yeah, I was going to ask you, how do you see this balance or relationship

538
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:33,400
between CIA and big tech companies considering how we are digitizing more

539
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,600
and more aspects of our lives and data represents the smallest faction

540
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:43,080
of information that we are gathering and analyzing and making sense out of?

541
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,600
Well,

542
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,400
there's two levels of information.

543
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,680
There's the.

544
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,920
The babble.

545
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,680
Of a world full of people who are babbling,

546
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,520
and Google owns that. How does they get it?

547
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,560
They have spiders, they have these bots that just float around all over the world.

548
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,040
Oh, there's a new website. See what's there.

549
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,040
Look at all the pages, gather it together now.

550
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,360
That's called the surface web.

551
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,120
There are three webs. There's the surface web, what Google can see,

552
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:29,200
which is all websites, OK, new stories, which we gather from websites,

553
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:36,480
electronic data, trivial shit, which, while it may help us understand

554
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,520
how Thomas Edison invented the light bulb, which he didn't,

555
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:46,120
it's not going to help us very much in finding out what's in the mind

556
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,160
of Iranian generals who might be planning an attack on U.S. soil.

557
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,760
Google is not going to, neither is Facebook, neither is Twitter.

558
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:00,800
So this is the realm of what's called the deep web.

559
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,920
Now, deep web can be indexed for a bunch of reasons.

560
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:08,280
Number one, it's either electronically organized,

561
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,360
but you can't get into it without being a member.

562
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,680
Like if you're a psychiatrist and you can prove you're a psychiatrist,

563
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,120
you can get into psych.com. If you're not, you can't.

564
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,360
Google cannot be everything and therefore cannot see what's happening there.

565
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,760
That's part of the deep web.

566
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,920
The other part is the non-electronic deep web.

567
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,200
I'm still calling it the web.

568
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,160
That information is gleaned by people who kidnap

569
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:40,720
lieutenants from Iran and take them to Guantanamo and torture them.

570
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,960
And so they think, pardon?

571
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,840
Old school, you're right.

572
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,680
Yeah, but that information,

573
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,920
the value of that information, if you can validate it,

574
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,160
we all know that under torture, people will tell you anything.

575
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,480
But a good operative might be able to get some truth.

576
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,000
That information is of extreme values,

577
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,120
the diamonds of information compared to what Google has,

578
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,280
which is the sandbox of information.

579
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,680
So those are our three levels,

580
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:19,400
the surface, which Google has, the deep web and electronic,

581
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,120
which people have been trying to index for years and can't because you can't be

582
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,560
a member of every secret product thing in the world.

583
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:33,080
And then the old school information.

584
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,640
I followed him to this address.

585
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:40,120
He went in, changed clothes, came out in the disguise and went north.

586
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,000
That information, that's the old school stuff.

587
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:48,040
Or we tortured him for nine weeks and we kind of think this might be the truth,

588
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,240
that information.

589
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,280
The CIA controls all three.

590
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,760
Google, you think the CIA does not have its thumbs in Google?

591
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,720
Of course it does.

592
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:06,160
It has its thumbs in any and every corporation that might be of value to it.

593
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:11,240
The deep web, I promise you, if there is a private website,

594
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,760
there is a CIA agent who has joined it with full credentials,

595
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,240
even if it had to be made up.

596
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,680
And the rest, the old school,

597
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:28,480
only the CIA has that information and that is the information which is used to

598
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:33,880
control presidents, congressmen and those who allegedly are in power.

599
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,320
But they're not.

600
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,680
We're living in an information age.

601
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,920
And if you're talking about international

602
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:44,680
relations, which is the stage upon which we float and survive,

603
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,360
then the only people who can advise you at the CIA

604
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,480
want to know what someone's thinking, the CIA will tell you.

605
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,840
Problem is, they're going to tell you the truth that they want to tell you.

606
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:00,280
And sometimes it's a lie, just like second Gulf War, Iraq has nuclear weapons.

607
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,880
They're about to bomb England.

608
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:02,960
Oh, really?

609
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,880
Well, OK, I need to do something.

610
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,320
So this is it.

611
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:15,280
But even they require us, the people, to support them in what they're doing.

612
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,800
Now, I'm not saying these are evil people.

613
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:22,120
No, in some respects, I understand

614
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,320
why they're doing what they're doing, because presidents are transients.

615
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,760
Do you think we elect a president who's

616
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:35,000
the smartest, who knows the most about the Middle East, China,

617
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:42,200
North Korea, the subtleties of Vietnam and its neighbor Cambodia,

618
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,520
what's happening with the Dalai Lama in Tibet?

619
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,280
Fuck no.

620
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,400
So you have to rely on advisors.

621
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,280
Who are your advisors?

622
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,720
The people who know who the CIA, the only ones who know.

623
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,160
This is our tragedy.

624
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:59,600
So they look at these idiots and they are

625
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:08,440
every one idiot in terms of the CIA agent who spent 50 years of his life

626
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,280
studying the nuances of the Muslim religion,

627
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:19,640
the political alliances stretching back into antiquity, the culture,

628
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:31,200
the system of marriage and love and managing the emotional chaos of the human being.

629
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,600
No, they know nothing of this shit,

630
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:43,000
not just in the Middle East, but in China, Nepal, in the Philippines, Venezuela.

631
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,400
And so these idiots come in and they run the country.

632
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,040
No, the CIA is not going to let that happen.

633
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:49,920
Fuck no.

634
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,600
We've got a plan that's been in place for 50 years.

635
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,920
You are not fucking up that plan.

636
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,640
Here's what you are allowed to do.

637
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,800
Now, they don't tell this to the president.

638
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,880
Of course not.

639
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,120
Mr. President, you're a boss here.

640
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,120
But no,

641
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,920
no, you're not.

642
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,880
You are a puppet and you will do what we say.

643
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,440
You just don't know it yet.

644
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,040
Would you say presidents are aware of this?

645
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,720
No, they're not aware of it.

646
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,280
They have no clue if they were nobody.

647
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,280
I mean, no, of course not.

648
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,960
Do you think Bush was aware he would be manipulated by the CIA

649
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,040
when they said the rocks got nuclear weapons?

650
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,360
Bomb them? No.

651
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,760
But was he aware at the end of his eight years?

652
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,280
No, no, no.

653
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,520
Listen, the CIA is too good, too fucking good.

654
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,920
No president knows this.

655
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,760
I know this because

656
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:48,240
the CIA was my first and largest customer and was remained my customer for years.

657
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,240
I have good friends within it.

658
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:55,160
Thank God it is as splintered as any other organization and bureaucracy.

659
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:59,560
I mean, one part of the CIA was trying to collect me in the Bahamas and another part

660
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,920
called me and said, they're coming for you at midnight tonight.

661
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,080
Sure as hell, we left just before they came.

662
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,960
They showed up, we were gone.

663
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,320
Hmm.

664
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,520
John, you're a cybersecurity legend.

665
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,560
How well this country or individuals are taking care of their cybersecurity in this

666
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,520
day and age? We have known people.

667
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,280
We haven't had any for 10 years.

668
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,160
People buy antivirus software.

669
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,480
It's useless.

670
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,000
It's useless.

671
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,800
The world has changed.

672
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,920
Nobody uses technology anymore.

673
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,840
Social engineering is how things are hacked.

674
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:39,280
Why? Why should I go to the trouble of writing sophisticated software to break

675
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:46,400
into your system when I can have a very clever neuro-linguistic programmer type

676
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:51,280
to sit out in the car and watch people come and go with badges and figure out who

677
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:56,160
is the secretary of the CEO who has everyone's passport, of course.

678
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,400
Is she married? Is she not?

679
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:02,280
Doesn't matter because even married, if the right person comes along,

680
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:08,560
you will slip and perhaps make a mistake that you may regret later.

681
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,520
But once you've slipped, you've slipped.

682
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:16,600
And that bastard you slipped for over the next few months is going to find out

683
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,240
everything about you pretty soon.

684
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,040
He's got everybody's passwords.

685
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,480
She doesn't even know it because the first thing he does is plant software on her

686
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:32,160
phone while she's sleeping after he has loved her into some ambulance.

687
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,680
He's got access to your phone.

688
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,720
Your phone is tapped.

689
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,080
Everyone is listening and watching pretty soon.

690
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,920
We're in.

691
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:44,800
Why bother spending two years writing sophisticated software when I can

692
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,320
fuck a secretary?

693
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,160
And this is happening in United States and in China and in Japan and in Europe and

694
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:57,000
all over the place, wherever there are men and women.

695
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:02,680
This is the oldest trick and game in the world by friend, you know,

696
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,760
boy meets girl.

697
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,240
The problem is,

698
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,880
do we always know where the girl came from?

699
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,880
Is she being paid to be with you?

700
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,000
And people in my position, I have to think of that, right?

701
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,200
So amazing.

702
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,360
That's one more question, my friend.

703
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,400
OK, let me ask you the last question that I ask all my guests then,

704
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:32,080
that if you come across an intelligent alien from a different civilization,

705
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,920
what would you say is the worst thing humanity has done?

706
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,280
And what would you say is their greatest achievement?

707
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,680
I'm telling this to the alien.

708
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,720
Sure.

709
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,960
As a representative of the human race.

710
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,040
I don't think I'd tell a jack shit,

711
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,120
because if you can't trust your own species, how the hell can you trust an alien?

712
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,040
I mean, I'm being honest with you now.

713
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,720
The best thing you can ever do is tell nobody anything, right?

714
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,200
You don't know who they are.

715
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,480
No, basically, I would fill his mind with disinformation.

716
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,480
I would go, we are a peaceful race.

717
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,120
We are unarmed.

718
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,920
We have no weapons of any kind.

719
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,080
We eat fruit.

720
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:17,000
We don't kill animals and only fruit has fallen off the trees.

721
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,760
We live in utter peace.

722
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,560
No one has ever struck another human being or harmed them in any

723
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,040
unbecoming shit like that.

724
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:30,520
Meanwhile, thinking, how do I get my data back home about what I'm trying to find

725
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,680
out about this mobile? The world is a dangerous place.

726
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,680
I would anticipate that the universe outside our earth is equally as dangerous.

727
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,880
And I would look upon that alien with the utmost distrust.

728
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:48,560
Now, if it were human like and female and had a really beautiful ass,

729
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:54,880
I might also explain that the way that we show our peace is by something we call

730
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,280
making love. And if you'll please get up to rest, I will show you how we do that.

731
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,120
But beyond that,

732
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,760
that would be open to mention best, all right?

733
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,000
Thank you very much.

734
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,760
Thank you so much, John. It was a pleasure.
