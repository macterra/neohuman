1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
See, the left brain, if it ever even admits that it's wrong, then that's a defeat.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,480
And that gets tied in with the self, and that's why we feel horrible.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,200
We're like, oh, you know, if you've ever been really wrong about something

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,840
because someone just threw something in your face and the evidence is overwhelming,

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,440
you feel self-defeated and you feel really bad.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,320
The right brain has none of that.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,200
The right brain can look at every wrong as an opportunity.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:30,360
And it's OK to be wrong.

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:36,640
Hello and welcome to the 53rd episode of a new human podcast.

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,040
I'm a Gavahari etiologist on Twitter and Instagram,

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,680
and you can follow the show on LiveInLimbo.com, iTunes and on YouTube.

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,440
And also we started to uploading different segments of the show on BitChute.

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,440
So today with me, I have Chris Nibar.

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,000
Am I pronouncing your family name correctly?

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,680
It's actually Nibar. Nibar. OK.

16
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,920
My apologies. English is not my first language.

17
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,920
I'm doing pretty good, I believe, but every day is an opportunity to learn something new.

18
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,680
So welcome to NeoHuman, Chris. Thank you.

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,280
It's great to be here. Yeah, awesome.

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,320
Let's start with your background, the work you've done

21
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,800
and what are you mainly focused on now these days?

22
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,000
Well, my training in grad school and my doctorate really centered around the left and right brain

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,120
and really low level perceptual processes.

24
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,640
But I found myself continuously asking bigger questions.

25
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,080
And the neuroscience stuff just kind of didn't really get me to where I wanted to be.

26
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,320
And in grad school, I started reading a lot of Eastern philosophy.

27
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,760
And fortunately, I had a mentor who was very open to that.

28
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,000
So we would kind of do normal science Monday through Thursday.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,800
And then Friday would be sort of philosophical speculation about mind, what it means to be human.

30
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,120
And so I kind of got that training along the way.

31
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,520
And it really helped because I found that kind of putting the two together,

32
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,680
putting the Eastern philosophy and the neuroscience together has been a really powerful tool

33
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,240
to kind of get a grip on who we are, what we're doing here, how we're going to fix it,

34
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,400
how we're going to clean it up, those kind of problems.

35
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,040
You have a new book.

36
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:26,360
I'm showing it to our viewers called No Self, No Problem, How Neuropsychology is Catching Up to Buddhism.

37
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,400
So I know you're in academia.

38
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:35,120
How is the take from your colleagues with respect to mixing Eastern philosophy and Western science?

39
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,800
Because in many respects, it seems like in the West, we figured everything out in the surface.

40
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:48,280
And academia, they have capitalized on that surface understanding of everything that we know about and we're experiencing.

41
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,160
And many academics that I came across are very hostile towards the Eastern philosophy and spirituality

42
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,120
and everything that comes from the other side of the world.

43
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,960
How has been your experience with respect to that?

44
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,600
I think you got a good take on it.

45
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,040
And there's a reason behind this.

46
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:12,600
Because if you look at the Buddhist discoveries and if you follow his simple discovery, the mind,

47
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:18,400
and then you follow the Zen Buddhist tradition that one could almost characterize as anti-intellectual.

48
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,360
And then you come to the university, which is the central place where we cultivate mind.

49
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,480
And being intelligent is the currency here at the university.

50
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,040
And so I'm not sure the two have the same goals.

51
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,840
And so sometimes there's a little bit of, I think maybe misunderstanding because at the university,

52
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,080
everything is about mind, intelligence, language is such a dominant force here at the university.

53
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,920
And yet you go into the Eastern tradition and monks may not speak at all for a long time.

54
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,640
And that's very confusing, I think, to the average academic because they see language as such a powerful force.

55
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:08,040
And then in the East, again, I think maybe the simplest symbolism is a finger pointing to the moon isn't the moon.

56
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,440
And in academia, we're looking at the finger and we think the finger is really important.

57
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,880
And so you see a lot of that mistaking the map of the territory in academia.

58
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,200
So I've had that challenge, I think.

59
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,400
And it also seems like the concept of not knowing is encouraged in Eastern philosophy,

60
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,040
but it's kind of penalized in the Western kind of culture in academia.

61
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,040
So it's like fundamental difference.

62
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:39,600
Oh, and I think you see this playing out probably to the greatest extent in the work on consciousness.

63
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,040
And you've got so many academics and you have so many brilliant thinking minds trying to figure out consciousness.

64
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:52,640
And there's a very real possibility that thinking mind cannot conceptualize consciousness.

65
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,760
Thinking mind might be limited with certain things.

66
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,640
We see the same thing with quantum mechanics and physics.

67
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:03,760
So the thinking mind just falls short of understanding anything about quantum mechanics.

68
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:10,840
And some of the famous quantum physicists have come right out and said that, you know, we don't understand it at all.

69
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,560
And I think you could apply that same thing to consciousness.

70
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,640
We may never, the thinking mind may never understand consciousness.

71
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:22,040
And academia looks at that as a huge failure, which may just be the way reality is.

72
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,160
Thinking mind might have its limitations.

73
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,400
Yeah, but I guess if you're in academia, you can't say we don't know what's going on,

74
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,600
yet you have to pay thousands of dollars so we can't teach you that.

75
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,360
Well, you know, I actually start off my consciousness class with a very famous quote.

76
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,040
I'll paraphrase it.

77
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:43,040
You know, on the topic of consciousness, nothing worth reading has ever been written about it.

78
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,840
Way to start a class.

79
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,760
And but, you know, this is there's a very old tradition.

80
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:55,360
If you start off, you know, Dao Te Ching and there's so many times in the East, I'll start off and I'll say, you know, anything that can the word,

81
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,640
the written word is not the truth and the truth can never be captured in the written word.

82
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,240
But by the way, I'm going to write a bunch of stuff anyway.

83
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,280
And so we do we talk about it.

84
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,360
We're talking right now using that left brain, linguistic thinking mind.

85
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,280
And and that's what we work with.

86
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,040
So your book is called No Self, No Problem.

87
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:28,800
Before we get into a more in depth kind of a conversation about consciousness and self and the purpose and meaning of it all and all of that,

88
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,040
how would you define self?

89
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,760
Well, that's a good question.

90
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,720
And that's one of those questions you could spend a lifetime contemplating.

91
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,800
It's one of the things that's very fascinating as a professor, because I got a lot of 20 year olds.

92
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,320
And and that's really what they're dealing with.

93
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,480
They're wrestling with this idea of who am I?

94
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,960
And they have to battle culture that's kind of imposing a certain self on them.

95
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,840
And they have to realize, well, am I what culture defines me as?

96
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,800
Is there something else there?

97
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:08,520
And I hit them up with the neuroscience part of it, which is seems to be pretty

98
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:14,440
as conclusive as you can get that the self is nothing but a thought of who we think we are.

99
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,080
No real substance itself.

100
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:23,960
And for example, in my I would teach these large intro classes in psychology and I would go over the split brain patients,

101
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,840
which is one of my favorite topics.

102
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:33,680
And I would focus on how the left brain makes up all kinds of explanations for how it thinks the world is working.

103
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,240
That's what the left brain does.

104
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:42,160
And one of the explanations to try to get a feel of what's going on around us is it creates this idea of a self.

105
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,280
And so the self is nothing more than another hypothesis that the brain has generated.

106
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,560
An illusion.

107
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,720
Yeah. There's no substance to it.

108
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,360
It's just a thought like any other thought we might have.

109
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,080
And so I will literally in my class say, well, the self is nothing more than a thought of the self.

110
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,880
And I will see students write that out.

111
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,320
I am nothing more than a thought of who I think I am.

112
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,320
But it's not really hitting them at that deeper level.

113
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,880
They're just looking at it as something to memorize for a test because that's a pretty deep thing to take in.

114
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:22,680
And especially in Western culture, we take the self as prized and we spend perhaps a whole lifetime cultivating the self,

115
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,080
building the self, distinguishing the self.

116
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,400
And that's the thing we're really desperately hoping doesn't die.

117
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,320
And so the fear of death is maybe the central threat to the sense of self.

118
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,320
And so we spend all this time in our culture building, defining.

119
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:45,480
And then you come along and you say, look, this thing you're working on, it's just a thought of who you think you are.

120
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,000
And I don't think it's not going to click right away.

121
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,400
And it takes a little time.

122
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,760
It's like you can't just go run a marathon one day.

123
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,160
You take little steps and that's the same thing with the self.

124
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:01,520
Seeing through the illusion of self is nothing that's going to happen overnight, particularly not in our culture.

125
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,640
So there's so much, so much to talk about.

126
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:14,560
You mentioned the left brain a number of times and for myself as well, but for also those of our audience who don't know the difference,

127
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,480
what is the difference between the left and the right brain?

128
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:25,880
Well, that's what I've been working on for about 20 plus years, trying to find what the core difference is.

129
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:33,760
Because if you look, one of the most obvious facts about the brain when you're looking at it anatomically is that nature did not just create one big brain.

130
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,480
And so if you look, there's just a clear left half and there's a clear right half.

131
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,240
And these things even have their own blood supply.

132
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,200
So they're really functionally separate.

133
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,120
But at the same time, nature created this connection, this bridge called the corpus callosum.

134
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,520
So we have two really separate brains, but they're highly interconnected.

135
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,840
And so you have to ask, well, why?

136
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,120
Why not just build one big brain?

137
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,360
And it turns out that when you get into the functions of the left and right brain, they're really like yin and yang.

138
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,280
They're really complementary to each other because nature can't build one system that can do everything.

139
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,040
It has to do division of labor.

140
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,440
And so we find the left brain. What is it good at?

141
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,600
And then we find the right brain and we'll see that what it's good at is actually very complementary.

142
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,160
And I'll give your viewers this kind of a I was just thinking about this over lunch.

143
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:25,040
I was thinking, what's the what's an icon of the left brain and a picture of the right brain that gives the gist of both?

144
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,640
And I think a desk.

145
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:33,320
And when I think of the left brain, I think of a desk because the whole thing about the left brain is it's trying to organize thoughts.

146
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,800
It's doing it almost entirely through language.

147
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,480
When we sit at the desk, that's what we do. We read, we write.

148
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,200
It's almost always language.

149
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,400
And we're trying to plan for the future and try to reorganize, learn from our past.

150
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,800
And that, I think, captures what the left brain is doing.

151
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,160
When I think about the right brain, I think about a playground.

152
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,960
I think about like kids like the right brain is so in the moment.

153
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,720
It's it's it's it has no seriousness of the left brain.

154
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,120
It's more about play.

155
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:06,640
It's more about being where you're at and doing what you're doing.

156
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,640
And we have a phrase for this we call mindfulness.

157
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,160
And so the mindfulness movement has been really huge through even academia.

158
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,160
I'm teaching a course. People can get credit on a class on mindfulness now.

159
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,240
And I think that all taps into what the right brain is all about.

160
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,240
It's being in the moment, not thinking about who you are, trying to better yourself as a person,

161
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,800
because you can't really do that when you're in the moment.

162
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:35,520
And I guess that I guess that would be the way I would kind of look at the two.

163
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:41,240
And of course, there's like thousands of research articles that we spend all the time getting into data.

164
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,600
But that's my kind of quick assessment of how I see the two sides of the brain.

165
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,080
And there are two different worlds that we're always choosing to live in one or the other.

166
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:55,920
And so you come to work, and even right now, you put the left brain on and we're able to communicate with language.

167
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,640
And then we go off and we play to the extent that we can.

168
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,960
And we play music. Music is a very strange thing.

169
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,640
Why do we listen to music?

170
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,400
We don't get any, no one gives us a check at the end of listening to music.

171
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,040
We're not getting, we're not bettering ourselves.

172
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,320
And so these are all right, all the things about the right brain, music, art, poetry.

173
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,560
These are the things we do because we just enjoy doing them.

174
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:24,120
And we're kind of losing track, I think, in our culture or our left brain culture.

175
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,480
We need to reconnect with that.

176
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,400
So would it be fair to say that children are more in touch with their right side brain?

177
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,960
Because this is the concept that keeps coming up that we actually have got it when we are children,

178
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:45,320
but then we grow up through the values that are being placed on us by our family and then education system

179
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,720
and then the society, and then we spend a lifetime to go back to where we begun.

180
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,160
That's absolutely it, in my view.

181
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,320
We start off, and if you've ever held an infant,

182
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,480
and it's just amazing to think what must be going on, the peace and tranquility

183
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,960
that must be going through their consciousness at that moment.

184
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,880
They have no mind, you know, they're just pure existence.

185
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,840
And that's not to say they don't cry sometimes, but when they're crying, they're crying.

186
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,600
And when they're happy, they're happy.

187
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,280
Then about two years old, we turn on the mind, and that's all left brain.

188
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,640
And that's when we start speaking, and we start talking,

189
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:24,200
and more importantly, that's when we start symbolizing the world.

190
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,040
And so instead of dealing with the real world, we start creating our images of the real world,

191
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,720
and that's all left brain.

192
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,160
And we spend a lifetime doing that, and if we're lucky, at some point,

193
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:43,120
maybe midway or maybe towards the end, we start connecting with where we started from.

194
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,440
And Picasso and his artists will tell us, you know, that's what they did.

195
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,680
They cultivated the left brain, they had a process,

196
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,440
and then they learned to paint like a kid again.

197
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,800
And that's where they found their talents.

198
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,680
And so that would be a great cultural message for us.

199
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:08,640
We need to kind of reconnect with that, you know, 12-month-old.

200
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:13,640
Because 12-months, the great thing about a 12-month-old is they're so in the present moment,

201
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,080
you know, every moment, and there's no self.

202
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,000
And we know this from, you're familiar with the mirror test.

203
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,720
You know, there's a test, you can test for self-awareness,

204
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,000
where you just put a kid in front of a mirror,

205
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,080
and I've got a wonderful video of my son failing it at 12 months.

206
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,320
And he would look in the mirror, and he was sure that that was another kid to play with.

207
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,720
So he didn't recognize himself, and he'd look behind the mirror trying to find that kid.

208
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,440
And he was just bewildered. He's like, where'd that kid go?

209
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,480
And he did this for almost about a half an hour.

210
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,520
And then about two, something clicks in, and that's the self that kicks in.

211
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,440
We look in the mirror, we say, oh, that's me.

212
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,360
And then we've got this, like, picking up a bunch of luggage,

213
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,520
and then we're going to carry this stuff around, you know, a whole lifetime.

214
00:14:54,520 --> 00:15:00,520
And if we're lucky, when we get a certain age, we realize that's just something that we've learned.

215
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,600
And if we've learned it, we can unlearn it.

216
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,760
And we put it back down, and then we kind of connect again with that inner child.

217
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,960
And then I think things can work out actually quite well.

218
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,560
Yeah, I was talking about a similar kind of a concept.

219
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,880
I have a Monday to Thursday live stream called Beyond Good and Evil.

220
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,400
And one of the concepts I talked about was involuntary baggage,

221
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:28,000
that we are being given certain things, again, by our family, by our school system,

222
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,560
by our society and culture, all the values that, for example, I was born in Iran.

223
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,920
I was one second old.

224
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,040
I was branded as a Shia Muslim straight male Iranian.

225
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,400
And, you know, good luck getting away from any of them.

226
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,320
That's a, I'm talking about baggage.

227
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,840
You just had a bunch of baggage just dumped on you.

228
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,080
Yeah.

229
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,080
What do you make of that?

230
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,480
I mean, what do you do with that?

231
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:59,360
Well, it just seems like those societies, they give more value to group thinking and

232
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:06,640
tribalism and one for all rather than individuals finding their own capability.

233
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:12,800
And it really is such a deep kind of a concept because religions also have capitalized on

234
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:21,200
that from my perspective, that, you know, enlightenment or the concept of Christ consciousness,

235
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,900
these are the things that are revealed on a personal basis, not that you believe in

236
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,000
something outside of yourself and you're going to be fine when you die.

237
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Right?

238
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,800
But it's a very powerful tool to influence people.

239
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,680
Well, you just hit on one of the main functions of the left brain, categorization.

240
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,080
And when we talk about categorization, we're talking about labeling people and you're

241
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,800
either in this group or you're in some other group.

242
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,640
And the left brain does this.

243
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:50,600
And it's very difficult for the left brain to conceptualize that these categories are

244
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,680
just constructs that are not real.

245
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,400
And so people think you really are this or you really are that.

246
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,840
And they don't get this, you know, a finger pointing to the moon kind of thing.

247
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,640
It's just a mental construct.

248
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,640
That's all categories are.

249
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,560
And so at the end of my book, I have an exercise really to help people get around categories.

250
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,360
And this is a very common thing people do when they do guided meditations.

251
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,880
So you get to a point where you're feeling a pretty decent meditation, then you ask,

252
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,160
you know, what would you be if you're not your gender?

253
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,080
What would you be if you're not your race?

254
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,680
What would you be if you're not your religion?

255
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:35,080
And you know, one by one, people tear out these layers of culture, you know, being taught

256
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,160
by their culture and they tear those apart.

257
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,040
And eventually they're left with what's in the middle.

258
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,040
What is in the middle?

259
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,120
That's a great question.

260
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,760
And that's a great left brain question, because the left brain wants answers.

261
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,200
And because the left brain is always creating hypotheses to explain the world, it always

262
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,440
comes up with concrete, I know this to be true kind of answers.

263
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,520
And what I found, at least in my own exploration and my workings with Zen and even neuroscience

264
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,640
is that when we get to the core and say, well, who am I, we very well may have to live with

265
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,120
a mystery.

266
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,040
And mysteries, as far as the right brain is concerned, mysteries that are tolerable, not

267
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:24,320
even tolerable, the right brain even may even crave a mystery and may love the unknown and

268
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,320
may love the fact that there's no definitive answer.

269
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,920
What do you think will happen if he scientifically can get rid of the left side of the brain

270
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:39,540
and expand the right side to include all of the functionality of our brain?

271
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,280
What kind of a society will be?

272
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,840
Because you mentioned race and gender and all of that, and the contrast to that is what

273
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,720
is happening in our societies right now that people are capitalizing only on race or only

274
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,720
on gender.

275
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,000
Well, actually, well, it's not just me.

276
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,520
There's another researcher out there, Ian McGillcrest, who wrote a wonderful book, The

277
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,440
Master and His Emissary.

278
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:06,800
And he is, his main hypothesis is that our culture is deeply possessed by the left brain

279
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,700
and its processing.

280
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:13,120
And so that's one of the consequences, a culture possessed by the left brain is going to want

281
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,640
to categorize everyone.

282
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,520
And these categories like race and gender, which again, you see these so popular on campuses

283
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,000
in particular, and that is a reflection of left brain processing.

284
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,840
So if we could, in a way, kind of turn down the left brain a little, and there are definitely

285
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,920
some ways we can do this.

286
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:38,160
And like you said, it's a great speculation, what would a right brain culture look like?

287
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,200
It would look really different than the one we live in.

288
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,440
Imagine it, imagine for just right off the top, imagine processing people individually.

289
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,480
So every person you meet, instead of categorizing them as male, and all the things that you

290
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,480
got thrown on you very early, what if we just met a person and thought for a moment, they're

291
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,240
a mystery, and I don't really know them.

292
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,360
And when you start off a relationship like that, it keeps all the possibilities open.

293
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,440
See, categories, the problem with them is they close possibilities down, and that's

294
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,320
the function of the left brain, because if you're going to make some kind of decision

295
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,400
or guess about the world, you have to close all the infinite possibilities down and decide

296
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,280
on one thing.

297
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,120
That's why the left brain so often thinks it's right about things.

298
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:29,600
You get this kind of sense, and especially in our culture, that we just assume this or

299
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,720
that is right.

300
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:39,480
And sorry about that, and the right brain is the exact, like I said, yin to yang, and

301
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:48,000
the right brain is always, well, maybe I'm wrong, and so I don't know you, and the right

302
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,400
brain, we could live in a culture where we live with that possible mystery, where maybe

303
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,240
we're wrong about things.

304
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,360
And it's also that maybe we're wrong, and it's okay.

305
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,320
But that maybe we're wrong, and it's terrible.

306
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,320
Yeah.

307
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,320
Well, exactly.

308
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,320
That's a great point.

309
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,320
See, the left brain, if it ever even admits that it's wrong, then that's a defeat, and

310
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,560
that gets tied in with the self, and that's why we feel horrible.

311
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,840
We're like, oh, if you've ever been really wrong about something because someone just

312
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,080
threw something in your face and the evidence is overwhelming, you feel self-defeated and

313
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,640
you feel really bad.

314
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,520
The right brain has none of that.

315
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:29,240
The right brain can look at every wrong as an opportunity, and it's okay to be wrong.

316
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,960
Could it be the difference between having a goal and objective and not having a goal

317
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,960
and objective?

318
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,960
Because without a goal and objective, all of these definitions will become moot completely.

319
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,000
You don't have to define right and wrong, good and bad.

320
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,240
You're just going with the flow.

321
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,760
You're living your life in the present unless you're moving towards something that every

322
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,680
step of the way you define whether or not you're getting closer or further from that

323
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,080
goal and ultimate objective.

324
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,080
Yeah.

325
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:58,200
Well, there's a great phrase in Zen, right and wrong are the sickness of the mind.

326
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:05,120
And so you see that with the left brain, that is right and wrong, and you see that tied

327
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,760
in with like, okay, what are my goals?

328
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,280
And so I so often see students where they're living just to get their degree, and when

329
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:17,000
they get their degree, then they're going to live to get married or some level of success.

330
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,920
And that's the problem with the left brain.

331
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,760
And I should mention a couple of things about the left brain that these are good qualities

332
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,360
in terms of evolution.

333
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,840
They probably got us out of a lot of messes 40,000 years ago.

334
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,000
And when we looked at kind of the environment that we had to deal with, we had to be kind

335
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
of paranoid and we had to plan for the future.

336
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,320
The problem is we just don't need this right now.

337
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:47,880
We've literally got more than we need in terms of the basics to live.

338
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:56,640
And you're probably familiar with Eckhart Tolle and The Power of Now, and I think that

339
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:02,360
hit our culture in a very interesting way because it was a wake up to the moment, you

340
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,800
know, and if you keep planning for the future, their whole life can go by, and then you weren't

341
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,400
even there to enjoy it.

342
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,360
That's the wonderful thing about getting the right brain going, that kind of present moment

343
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,720
awareness, and just be there for a little bit.

344
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,680
So you actually were there for your existence.

345
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:26,280
Chris's new book is called No Self, No Problem, How Neuropsychology is Catching Up to Buddhism.

346
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:33,060
You mentioned the mirror test, and my understanding is that humans and chimps are the only species

347
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,040
who can recognize themselves in the mirror.

348
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,120
Is that true?

349
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,880
The list keeps getting longer.

350
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,960
And so dolphins seem to have passed the test, elephants have passed the test, actually even

351
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:47,080
some birds, like magpies, which have very tiny brains, and this is kind of a mystery

352
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:52,720
because in neuroscience, we're so connected to this idea that brain creates consciousness,

353
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,200
that brain creates who we are.

354
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,400
And so if you, like before, you're saying, well, who are we?

355
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,240
Well, as far as neuroscience is concerned, you are that three pounds of gelatinous goo

356
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,240
in your skull.

357
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,640
I mean, that's the beginning and end to neuroscience.

358
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,360
And so it's a mystery.

359
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,760
We can't figure this out because you think, well, the self is a very complex thing, and

360
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,720
we prize it so much, but then you have this bird brain literally passing the mirror test.

361
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,520
And so people don't really know what to make of that.

362
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,520
You talked about Zen.

363
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,160
I've been influenced by Zen a lot, starting with Alan Watts.

364
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:31,800
And then I came across a traveling, even though he was not calling himself a Zen monk anymore,

365
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,680
but this was an old Japanese man I came across in Toronto.

366
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:41,560
And he got kicked out of a Zen monastery when he was in his teen in Japan because he experimented

367
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,600
with psilocybin mushroom.

368
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:50,840
And he told me that what was revealed to him and what he experienced was so mind blowing

369
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,480
that he couldn't keep it to himself.

370
00:24:52,480 --> 00:25:00,200
So he ran and told his Roshi, his master, and he got kicked out of the monastery because

371
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,840
you're taking the easy way out, basically.

372
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,440
You're cheating.

373
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:14,560
Do you see any kind of reasoning for the kind of stigma that has been built around psychedelics

374
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:21,240
mainly because it empowers the right side of the brain in the society that is inherently

375
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,880
built upon the left side dominance?

376
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:32,240
That's a great question because one of the most interesting responses came when a bunch

377
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:38,600
of monks started, or a bunch of neuroscientists and a bunch of monks started to get together

378
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,200
because they realized there's a deep connection between what neuroscience is finding and what

379
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,440
Buddhism had held for so many years.

380
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,440
And it came down to a discussion between the Dalai Lama and a bunch of neuroscientists.

381
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,560
And one neuroscientist put it just like this.

382
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,800
He asked the Dalai Lama if he could just take a pill and get the same effects of meditation,

383
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,160
would he do it?

384
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,600
And he didn't even think about it.

385
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,760
He's like, yeah, give me the pill.

386
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,720
And I think that kind of was startling to people because they kind of feel exactly as

387
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,560
you put it, like you're cheating somehow.

388
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:15,520
And the only thing I can come up with is I think that's a left brain response.

389
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:21,080
Like if you can somehow cheat the left brain out of its dominance, it's going to somehow

390
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,080
defend itself.

391
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,040
And it's going to say, no, don't take these drugs.

392
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,280
You're getting there the easy way.

393
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,960
And it's funny because in our culture, I would put it this way.

394
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,640
I'd say because of the left brain dominance, we have a terrible thinking problem on our

395
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,200
hands.

396
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,840
And what we're doing is we're trying to think our way out of the thinking problem.

397
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,880
And that just isn't working.

398
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,240
So there are other methods to do this.

399
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,080
And there are drugs that people ingest.

400
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:53,960
And all of a sudden, the mind turns off like Ron Doss when he describes his experience.

401
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:59,580
And all of a sudden, the self, it's like an immediate deconstruction of the self.

402
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,320
And it's a permanent life changer.

403
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,320
And so with the left brain, when it kicks in, it's going to say, oh, you cheated.

404
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,320
You can't get there from here.

405
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,040
That's not fair.

406
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,040
But there it is.

407
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:18,440
I mean, you clearly have the mystics who have done meditation, and there's certainly the

408
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,200
various drugs that have been ingested that have seen through the illusion of self.

409
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,960
And if you get there, you get there.

410
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:29,040
And so I'm not going to critique that or have a judgment on it.

411
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:34,120
Terrence McKenna had a joke, I actually heard it on Joe Rogan, that Buddha comes to town

412
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,640
and the monk tells him, I've been practicing levitation across the river for 10 years.

413
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,640
And Buddha looked at him and was like, but the fairy is just a nickel.

414
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,640
Yeah.

415
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,440
I mean, we want to work for things.

416
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,280
I mean, that's the thing about the left brain.

417
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,520
When you put these goals and the brain always wants to have, the left brain always wants

418
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,640
to have like some kind of calendar, we're going to say, well, this is how hard I'm going

419
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,560
to work today, and this is how hard I'm going to work tomorrow.

420
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,520
And there's a kind of an effortlessness with the right brain.

421
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,080
And that's the whole Zen trip, in my opinion.

422
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,800
They have this ability to get through life without trying.

423
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,680
And they're not putting effort into anything.

424
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:16,320
And the left brain looks at that and goes, ah, I just don't get it.

425
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,360
It doesn't make sense to work for things.

426
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,200
And yeah, interesting.

427
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,920
Are you familiar with the concept of or theory of stoned ape?

428
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,920
Oh, yeah.

429
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,320
What are your thoughts on that?

430
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:38,120
Well, from my memory, which I actually did this sketches not that long ago, the idea

431
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,200
is that we have certain mushrooms available in our history.

432
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,560
So we're going back 40,000 years, perhaps.

433
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:52,040
And with the ingestion of these various mushrooms, certain characteristics of bravery.

434
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:56,760
But at the same time, kindness came along, and that would make for a great leader.

435
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,560
And I mean, it's an interesting idea.

436
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:05,080
I'm not sure how testable it is, because when we get back that far, it gets really difficult.

437
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:09,240
But I think these are characteristics of the right brain, and that's the interesting thing

438
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,880
about fearlessness and courage.

439
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,680
They're very difficult to do, and you've got a serious self dragging along, because you're

440
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,640
always worried about the self.

441
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,200
And that's the thing about the warrior or the hero.

442
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,200
They put the self aside, and it's not about them anymore.

443
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:34,000
I was just telling the story about the grail myth and the wounded grail king, and that's

444
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,160
the message of that.

445
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,400
To whom does the grail serve?

446
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,640
And you realize it's not a selfish thing anymore.

447
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,640
It's about community.

448
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,800
And all of a sudden, the grail king's wounds heal from that.

449
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:53,040
And I think that's a message that these kind of factors, which again, all align with the

450
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:59,240
right brain, might make for really a very good leader, kind of the leader that we need

451
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,240
in our culture.

452
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,800
I think we could really use right brain leaders that have seen through the nature of the self,

453
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:13,620
and their function isn't really a selfish one, and their function is more community-based.

454
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:19,040
And that's where we get kind of into the non-dualism stuff.

455
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:23,560
Do you think a right brain kind of a person will see the necessity to lead at all, to

456
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,560
become a leader?

457
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,560
No.

458
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,560
I don't think they would.

459
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,760
That's what would make them a good leader.

460
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:37,320
I think the idea of wanting to lead is too tied in with left brain ego, and that's going

461
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,760
to mess things up, I think.

462
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:45,600
And I think the best leaders are the ones that don't want to lead at all.

463
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,280
There's a movie called Johnny Got His Gun.

464
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,680
I don't know if you've seen it.

465
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,760
Most people have seen excerpts in Metallica's one music video.

466
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:59,200
It's about a soldier who went to World War I, a young man.

467
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,000
He lost his limbs, his arms and legs.

468
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,320
He can't hear, he can't see.

469
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,760
It's a black and white movie, and you see him on the bed of a hospital with a cone on

470
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,760
his face.

471
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,280
And his narration is the voice inside his head.

472
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:18,280
And I always think of this movie and use it as an example as to find out who we are, who

473
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,840
this self is, because you get rid of the arms.

474
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:26,640
We always say, my arms, my legs, my heart, my stomach, who is that my?

475
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,040
And it seems like it's such an unknown and such an inherently unknown thing at the core

476
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:38,800
of existence that we've taken intentional detour towards focusing on the left brain,

477
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,360
because those are the things that we can quantify.

478
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,740
Those are the things that we can make sense out of.

479
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:50,000
But it seems like that disconnect is finally catching up with us.

480
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:59,640
Well, yeah, I think one of the major advances we'll have is in terms of what we're identifying

481
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:05,320
myself, and I think the idea of identifying with a body is one of the major things that

482
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,840
we need to deal with.

483
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:13,360
And once you realize you're not this meat suit, and this is just something I'm kind

484
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:19,540
of occupying for the time being, and whatever my essence of self is, this isn't it.

485
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,840
And that's, to me, that's the beginning.

486
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,000
And when you see that, then you're off to a good start.

487
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,960
And the problem, of course, is, again, because no particular part is necessary, and no particular

488
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,920
thought is necessary for the self.

489
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,980
And I think that's actually what the Buddha was getting at when he was talking about his

490
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,640
lecture on no self.

491
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,760
He's like, look, reality is in a continuous state of flux and change, and it's moving.

492
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,720
So how could there be this solid, continuous sense of self behind all that, when the nature

493
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,440
of reality is exactly the opposite?

494
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,800
And so this body is going to, it's very temporary, it's going to flash a light, it's going to

495
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,280
be here and it'll be gone.

496
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,640
That can't be me.

497
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,560
It's also the subjectivity of self, too, right?

498
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:10,040
It's like when you're in a conversation with someone else in a room, there are three different

499
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:16,080
versions of you exist, each of you exist, one that you think who you are, one that the

500
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,280
other person thinks who you are, and one that who you really are.

501
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:26,440
And the one that you think the other person thinks you are.

502
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,760
And that's how we get to so many deep levels.

503
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:35,600
I mean, the left brain is very clever in its depth and its ability to think about thinking.

504
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:42,200
And so, even if you conceptualize that self as a thought, it still gets very deep into

505
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,920
this like, well, who am I, well, am I who I think I am, am I really an introvert?

506
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:51,120
And then you think, well, maybe I just think other people think I'm an introvert and that's

507
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,480
why I think I'm an introvert.

508
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:59,020
And then you realize these are all just thoughts and if thoughts are just things that come

509
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:05,160
and go like, you know, leaf falling kind of thing, then maybe who's to take them so seriously?

510
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:13,760
Do you think this reality that we're experiencing is a result of this device that is our brain

511
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,680
working like a computer, making sense out of the information that exists in a way that

512
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:24,560
everything and everybody in this world has their own version of experiences, but the

513
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:31,360
more powerful the computer is, the processor is, more you can make sense out of it?

514
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:37,200
Is that something that is a sensible kind of a statement?

515
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:45,320
Are you suggesting the idea that, like, this is a simulation kind of thing or?

516
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:50,940
Well, that's one way to look at it, but let's think about it in the context of artificial

517
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:56,720
intelligence, for example, that we are making the argument that maybe we can model the human

518
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,200
brain but we can never model consciousness.

519
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,600
Oh, yes, actually, yes, exactly.

520
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:11,040
So I also teach a class on artificial intelligence and the idea that we're creating artificial

521
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,120
minds, I think there's no doubt that we've already done this.

522
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,240
I mean, when talking about the mind, that's the way I've discussed it.

523
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,280
It's this thinking machine and it solves problems in my phone, solves all kinds of problems

524
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,600
and it figures out all kinds of puzzles.

525
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:28,160
So we already have an artificial mind, but that mistake that I was getting back to that

526
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,620
is so common is to confuse mind with consciousness.

527
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:37,240
As though the computers are doing an outstanding job replicating mind, but in my opinion, that

528
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,720
says nothing about consciousness.

529
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,160
How would you define consciousness?

530
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,520
Because a lot of people use this term the same way they use the term God.

531
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,120
They don't really understand it.

532
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,360
We don't, nobody understands it and this is just putting labels on the unknown and it

533
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,800
seems to me that all of them could be the same thing.

534
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,080
We're just calling it with different names.

535
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:00,880
And that's, we'll get back to, okay, well, what's the self and I was satisfied with leaving

536
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,640
it as a mystery and I think the same holds true for consciousness.

537
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:11,200
And that's, so when we put the whole thing together, we see that consciousness is vast

538
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,200
enough.

539
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,440
It can hold the thinking mind without a problem.

540
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,080
It can channel through the thinking mind and that's the normal person.

541
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:23,800
But when we reverse it and we say, can the thinking mind hold consciousness and it can't.

542
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:29,640
And so that's why the thinking mind is such a mystery and it just can't, and so I don't

543
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:34,400
think the thinking mind has the capacity to understand in a way that we understand other

544
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,400
things.

545
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,680
And it can't apply this to consciousness and so in that sense it has to remain a mystery,

546
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,080
but that's only to the thinking mind.

547
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:47,920
And so, you know, when you get into some pretty good meditative states and you empty consciousness

548
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,880
of all content and then you ask, and then as it comes this feeling like, well, why do

549
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,200
I need to understand anything, you know?

550
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,320
And so I don't think consciousness will be understood, but I also think that's okay.

551
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,560
So would you say that consciousness is something that exists without us and we're just making

552
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:13,720
sense out of it based on our own experience or is this consciousness as a result and outcome

553
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:18,600
of our own experience based on our brain capacity?

554
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:25,160
My favorite metaphor for all this, I like the fountain outside of Bellagio, the hotel

555
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,160
in Las Vegas.

556
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,440
Now when you see these fountains it's really cool because you see these shooting, you know,

557
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:38,240
little isolated spots of water and then they go back to kind of the eternal consciousness.

558
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,640
And so I think, you know, the question of the one in many is a very difficult one, but

559
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,440
to me that's an image that captures the best I can do in understanding how the process

560
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,440
is happening.

561
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,120
So we stem from this eternal consciousness and just for a real brief moment it feels

562
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:59,800
like we're separate, but once that separate water gets back into the one, it's indistinguishable.

563
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:04,920
It immediately connects and becomes part of the whole big picture again and for my take

564
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,480
that's what's going to happen and that's what's happening right now.

565
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:11,800
So I get this little trip of being this unique individual consciousness, but then it's just

566
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,520
going to go back into the collective.

567
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:19,560
Yeah, since we talked about psychedelics, I think it's interesting to mention it in

568
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:26,160
this context, 5-MeO-DMT, Bufo, are you familiar with it?

569
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,320
No, not.

570
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:35,360
So it's a poison of one kind of species out of 7,000 plus amphibian species and this is

571
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:41,880
a Bufo alvarius who lives in Sonoran Desert and comes above the ground only two months

572
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,840
in a year and its clue is rain hitting the ground.

573
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:53,680
It's only on the ground for two months and it produces these poison in its glands that

574
00:38:53,680 --> 00:39:01,240
can be milked, dried up and smoked and it's the most intense psychedelic experience on

575
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:07,520
this planet and what you're explaining about consciousness as a surface that we just as

576
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:13,720
drops we just come out of it and go back to it, that's the closest that I could experience

577
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:19,920
at first hand after smoking certain amount of that because you're gone, you do not have

578
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:28,200
a body, your environment do not exist and you go to this environment that is so alien

579
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:33,120
yet safe if that makes sense.

580
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:37,280
It's very strange kind of an experience, it takes from the moment that you smoke it to

581
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:45,640
come back to normal maybe 25 minutes and it made me think a lot that where is this place,

582
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:50,560
is this where we're going after we die and then I did some research about quantum fluctuations

583
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:56,240
that the empty space is not really empty and perhaps that's what it is.

584
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,680
So it's really interesting because this whole thing was extracted for the first time in

585
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:07,240
the 50s so it's not something that our ancestors have been doing it and to have this experience

586
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:13,080
in this kind of a society and this kind of a reality which as you said is very left brain

587
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:18,400
dominated and I'm not encouraging people to go and do that, I'm just saying that there

588
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,160
are very real ways because I've also heard that if you do certain kind of yoga you can't

589
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:28,840
get to that state of mind experiencing it, there are very real pathways to experience

590
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:37,080
that unity which is something that exactly like you said don't need to be understood,

591
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:41,240
it just needs to be experienced and once you experience it there is no going back, you

592
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,920
cannot unknow it.

593
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:47,400
That sounds kind of, when you were describing that it sounds like various descriptions of

594
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,400
the DMT trip.

595
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:58,800
It is a DMT, it's a natural DMT so the synthetic DMT is NN-DMT, this is 5-MeO-DMT, only this

596
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:06,240
one toad produces it in its glands out of 7000 plus amphibians and the only difference

597
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:12,800
between I would say 5-MeO and NN-DMT is that it does not have as strong of a visuals of

598
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,840
NN-DMT which is synthetic extract DMT but yeah you're gone, you're in a place, you're

599
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:26,160
in a room but you're gone and I've been around a lot of people who've done it who start

600
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:32,400
screaming, start acting in a very strange kind of a way and when they come out of it

601
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,840
they don't remember any of it.

602
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:41,640
Well it's interesting because we can be a left brain dominated culture but we're still

603
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:47,360
confronted with mystery after mystery so we've got near death experiences and we've got very

604
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:53,600
detailed accounts like Evan Alexander and his brain is just melting away and yet his

605
00:41:53,600 --> 00:42:00,360
consciousness is in a world that's way more real than how he would describe this reality

606
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:05,560
and then we've got these parallel worlds that people seem to go to under various drugs

607
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:12,000
and we've got all kinds of anomalous conscious experiences, out of body experiences and to

608
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,240
me that's quite fascinating because what it does is it throws us into a mystery of not

609
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:21,560
really knowing, there's just enough evidence that we say maybe but it's not so conclusive

610
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:26,440
that we can know with any certainty and that I think is maybe the meaning of all this.

611
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,440
Absolutely.

612
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,600
And have a little fun with this trip because it's a wild ride and it ultimately is a mystery

613
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:37,200
no matter how much the brain thinks it knows everything and can predict the future, it

614
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,200
really doesn't.

615
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,920
Yeah I think Alan Watts also explained it really beautifully that when you listen to

616
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,480
music it's not like you're looking forward to the last hit of the song or the last beat

617
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:52,400
of the song you just enjoy throughout, you dance with it until it's over.

618
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,040
That's a great right brain, that's why I said it's a playground and Alan Watts has that

619
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:04,560
wonderful story about what would God do, what would an all-powerful being do?

620
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:10,360
All-knowing, all-powerful, it's very likely it could just kind of get bored, kind of get

621
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:17,520
dragged, it would just kind of be like, okay, you know, and so maybe to entertain itself it would lose itself.

622
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,680
And in losing itself, that's what we are, we're just kind of like, you know, all these

623
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:27,720
kind of dreams, you know, of the eternal that's having all at once.

624
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:33,800
And it's a wild ride, I once said that God is an experience junkie and the way God is

625
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,200
fulfilling all these wild experiences is through each one of us.

626
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:44,520
And so each one of us is having a really interesting ride and giving God a unique view of like,

627
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:49,200
I mean, how could God worry about death unless it was through us?

628
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:53,640
And when we worry about death, we're giving a very unique experience to the universe,

629
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,400
something that couldn't happen without us.

630
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:02,280
And so I think Alan Watts put it something like that, that the most square people are

631
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:10,040
really are having the very best ride in this game, the people who take work terribly seriously

632
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:17,640
and the people who are very, very, you know, particular, there is, you know, the rule book

633
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:26,720
in life is very thick and so they're giving the universe a very interesting ride.

634
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,400
So that's actually what you talked about consciousness.

635
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:36,360
Your definition of consciousness is what I was talking about, whether or not everything

636
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:42,320
in this world experiences consciousness according to our processing capability of making sense

637
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,320
out of it.

638
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:48,000
The other way I can explain it, the way I understand it is that consciousness is like

639
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:54,720
internet and each of us are like computers that you get connected to internet, but if

640
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,760
the computer is gone, it doesn't mean that internet is gone.

641
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,760
Internet exists.

642
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:04,280
Our link to it has been vanished.

643
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:09,200
That's a popular view now in consciousness research that the brain, and it goes back,

644
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,320
some of the early physicists had this idea and certainly the mystics that the brain is

645
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:15,240
more of a receiver and it's just channeling in.

646
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:19,880
In fact, it may not even be channeling in consciousness as much as it's filtering out

647
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:25,240
a lot of the kind of totality of what consciousness could experience.

648
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,720
And I like that view.

649
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:32,240
Certainly, there's certainly a connection between brain and consciousness in the sense

650
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,080
that you affect brain, you affect consciousness.

651
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:39,680
And so we can't overlook there's some connection there.

652
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:44,440
But then the counter to that has been, well, how do I even know I have a brain?

653
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,880
Isn't this something people have told me?

654
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,480
I've never seen my brain.

655
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,160
It's as much a hypothetical as anything else.

656
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,160
X-ray maybe?

657
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,160
No?

658
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:58,280
But then you say, well, I've had MRIs, but even that, you just don't get to see the

659
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,600
stuff and it's still considered a hypothetical.

660
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:06,800
I'll just give you one opinion that came up.

661
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,720
But it just always leads us back to that mystery.

662
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:15,480
And neuroscience, because it started off as a left brain endeavor, it was so certain it

663
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,120
was going to figure things out with the brain.

664
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:22,640
And you know, the 90s were considered the decade of the brain, so we started this adventure

665
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,600
a long time ago.

666
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,080
And we've got the brain mapped out very well.

667
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:30,840
And people know the different functions of different parts of the brain, but it hasn't

668
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:34,800
yielded one bit of insight into the nature of consciousness yet.

669
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,800
And I think that, though, is kind of telling.

670
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:42,920
What does it say if decades of brain research haven't told us really, if we don't even

671
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:47,460
have a good theory of actual consciousness, or even a bad theory right now, let alone

672
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,000
a good theory.

673
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:56,040
And so maybe it's just, I mean, people keep waiting for that, you know, maybe it's just

674
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,640
around the corner, someone's going to come up with some breakthrough discovery about

675
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:05,680
how three pounds of matter gives rise to awareness.

676
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,680
That's not my bet.

677
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:11,120
My bet is, I'm going to hold out that it's going to be an eternal mystery.

678
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:15,560
And then the nature of reality is, even with the physics and the quantum mechanics, the

679
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:21,960
ultimate nature of reality will be something that the mind as we experience it in this

680
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,040
existence is just not going to get.

681
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,800
And that's not disappointing to me.

682
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,640
I think that's actually quite exciting.

683
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:34,120
So the title of your book is How Neuropsychology is Catching Up to Buddhism.

684
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:38,680
And as you mentioned, neuroscience has been left brain heavy.

685
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:43,960
Are you suggesting that neuroscience is moving more and more towards the right brain?

686
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:50,840
And also, what right brain people can learn from left brain dominated individuals and

687
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:55,240
cultures to add something to this experience?

688
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:59,800
Well, I think the left brain has sort of played itself out.

689
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:05,960
And these scientists, they're very serious types and then they've kind of given it to

690
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:10,240
do and they've kind of pushed the thinking mind as far as it will go and it's just not

691
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,240
yielding anything.

692
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,440
And I think they're kind of like, well, maybe there's something else, maybe there's another

693
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,820
way around this.

694
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:22,000
And that's why I think the neuroscience and the Buddhism are so well connected.

695
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,400
Because they're realizing that just because something is a mystery, just because something

696
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,200
is what we call a mystical experience, that doesn't invalidate it.

697
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,800
These mystical experiences are just as valid.

698
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:42,560
And so they're worthy of being explored and taken as something that we should consider.

699
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:46,800
And it's interesting too, you ask about what kind of right brain learn about the left brain.

700
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:53,840
And I was just talking to someone who they were describing how they get into left brain

701
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:54,840
conversations.

702
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:59,480
And as I mentioned, the left brain always finds a problem, that's its job, it tries

703
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:06,040
to find a problem and wants something better and wants the next best thing.

704
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,080
And so that's why we complain all the time.

705
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:14,960
And so if you watch humans, or very interesting, we get these little groups and we start complaining.

706
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,080
And again, we have this wonderful thing where who had the worst day?

707
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:23,000
And it's this contest where someone wins and then you're like, well, I had the worst day.

708
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,120
And then did you really win by having the worst day?

709
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,120
It's a strange thing.

710
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:30,480
In their mind, they won because they had the best complaint.

711
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,440
And so you watch people complain and that's of course all left brain.

712
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:40,120
So the right brain can really, I think can get a really wonderful view of the mechanics

713
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:44,600
of the left brain by watching it do what it does best.

714
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:49,760
So you get in these complaint sessions and you just kind of sit back and watch.

715
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:55,880
So this is the left brain, not happy with it.

716
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:59,000
And again, you know, Steven Pinker, I just showed this in class the other day, Steven

717
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,520
Pinker showing that, you know, we live in the absolute best time, you know, in terms

718
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,320
of like, if you could live at any point in human history, you'd really want to live now.

719
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:12,480
And so we have it really good and there's so much to be thankful for, so much to have

720
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,120
gratitude for.

721
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,640
And yet the left brain ignores all that.

722
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:21,200
It's like there's this beautiful existence just waiting to be noticed, but the left brain

723
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,880
would rather complain about a parking space someone stole.

724
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:30,200
And so it becomes kind of a fascinating adventure to watch people engage in these left brain

725
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:35,640
activities because at least in my experience, you just think, I can't believe I fell for

726
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,640
it.

727
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:42,280
Like, well, you know, I was horribly neurotic in my 20s and I had fallen for it.

728
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,520
I fell for every trick the left brain had.

729
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:52,040
I think she said every moment terrified of death and it's interesting to kind of have

730
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:56,760
this adventure and kind of like now look back and go, oh, I remember you.

731
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:57,760
I remember that.

732
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:03,560
I remember you taking everything seriously and I remember you finding fault in everything.

733
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,280
And so it kind of reminds me almost like an exhibit.

734
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:10,840
Like you go to like a museum and you see these dinosaur bones and you're kind of in awe about

735
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:16,080
it and then you see someone complaining and it's like, oh, that's that 40,000 year old

736
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:20,720
program that got us out of that mess 40,000 years ago, but it's still running in people's

737
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:29,440
heads, finding fault, wanting something that's different than what you have, that insatiable

738
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:36,200
need for more, all that got us out of a big mess 40,000 years ago, but we just don't need

739
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,200
it any longer.

740
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,360
It's a program that's never been updated.

741
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:46,040
It's kind of a strange thing to think you've got a 40,000 year old program that just, I

742
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:52,840
call it mind version 1.0 because it's that old and no one has ever updated it.

743
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:59,960
And so it's still running and our culture, rather than sit back and observe it, we've

744
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,320
embraced it.

745
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:05,480
And I think that's when I said that we have a serious thinking problem on our hands, that's

746
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,480
what I'm getting at.

747
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:13,160
It's that mind 1.0 that goes off and has this belief it's going to think its way out of

748
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,160
the thinking problem.

749
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,880
And I just don't see that happening.

750
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:23,320
Yeah, and this victimhood Olympics that is happening in the mainstream of our cultures,

751
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:28,640
that is, as you said, it's further and further left brain focused, do you think this is happening

752
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:33,040
because of the uncertainty, which is in the nature of everything that is happening now

753
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:38,160
more and more because of free internet and just decentralized ways of interpretation

754
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:46,000
and distribution of information using social media rather than 25, 30 years ago when people

755
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:52,800
who had relied on left brain could make some kind of an identity as a whole that, oh, this

756
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,040
is what life means, this is what I supposed to be doing.

757
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:00,680
But now anybody, you know, you have a cell phone, you have the ability to just express

758
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:01,680
yourself.

759
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,840
Do you think is that why that we are giving more value to victimhood?

760
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:10,720
Oh, I think what the internet and I think what social media potentially can do is like

761
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,120
giving steroids to the left brain.

762
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:16,760
It immediately cranks it up because when we take a look, one of the things the left brain

763
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:22,560
engages in, it's one of these basic processes is confirmation bias.

764
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:26,760
And the problem is that, you know, even 50 years ago, people were somewhat limited.

765
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,280
Well, I can go out and I can try to confirm my hypothesis, but the internet has allowed

766
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:37,160
us this vast network of all kinds of ways that we can absolutely become certain.

767
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:40,360
That left brain loves the certainty it can find in the internet.

768
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:44,840
As the left brain becomes not just fairly certain, it becomes absolutely certain that

769
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,640
this is true or that is true.

770
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:51,720
And again, if we cultivate that victimhood culture, which is exactly what the left brain

771
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,400
wants to do, poor me, you know.

772
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,840
So again, people say, well, why did you call your book No Self, No Problem?

773
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:05,480
Because, as soon as you do away with the self, you do away with all your problems.

774
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:09,200
And so, and then the exact opposite happens with victimhood culture, you know.

775
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,200
Why me?

776
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:15,240
Well, all that's doing is cranking up the sense of self and saying, you know, and all

777
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,240
these false comparisons.

778
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:20,480
Oh, I could have this and I could have that and it's so easy to get online and see people

779
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:25,600
who have Ferraris and, you know, 10 million dollar homes and all of a sudden the self

780
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,680
feels, oh, that could be me.

781
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,440
And we never decide, you know, we never look the other way.

782
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,160
We never look at all the things that we have and all the things that we could be grateful

783
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,160
for.

784
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:41,120
And it's turning out gratitude turns out to be a very likely a right hemisphere function.

785
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:44,480
And so we've got that kind of, you know, yin and yang again, where we see the left brain

786
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:49,560
complaining because it doesn't have everything and the right brain is satisfied with all

787
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:55,040
that it has, which is most of the time more than it needs.

788
00:54:55,040 --> 00:55:02,040
Chris's book is called No Self, No Problem, How Neuropsychology is Catching Up to Buddhism.

789
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:06,040
What's next for you, Chris, and how can people follow your work?

790
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:14,760
I have placed your Twitter handle, Worried Buddha, on the screen for our viewers to see.

791
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,640
There's a question there, too, that if you're a Buddha, why are you worried?

792
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,640
Well, because that sucks.

793
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:24,640
We all have a Buddha nature, but at the same time, we're playing this game of mind.

794
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:29,920
I mean, I sound like I'm kind of coming down hard on the left brain, but in the end, it's

795
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,640
the eternal consciousness that decided to play this game that we're playing.

796
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,800
So if we're worried, it's because eternal consciousness is having a little fun with

797
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,600
being worried, you know.

798
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:50,880
But I've got a web page up, that's chrisnebarphd.com, and I've got a Facebook page, which is actually

799
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:55,320
Catching Up with the Buddha, and I do a lot of my work on that.

800
00:55:55,320 --> 00:56:00,160
And I do a YouTube channel, or do these little videos, and it's just chrisnebarphd, and two

801
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:06,880
minute videos, just nature of self, consciousness, and all that.

802
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:07,880
Excellent.

803
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,840
Well, we've been talking for almost an hour.

804
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:11,840
It's been a pleasure.

805
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,440
Thank you so much for being here.

806
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,880
I enjoyed it tremendously.

807
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:19,700
Let me ask you the last question that I ask all my guests, that if you come across an

808
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:24,960
intelligent alien from a different civilization, what would you say is the worst thing humanity

809
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:25,960
has done?

810
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:29,160
And what would you say is our greatest achievement?

811
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:35,480
Wow, okay.

812
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,480
I might almost say the same thing.

813
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:41,440
I'd say our worst thing we have done is cultivated mind.

814
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,040
And at the same time, the best thing we have done is cultivated mind, because it's allowed

815
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,280
us the opportunity to see beyond it.

816
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:52,640
And so it would be very interesting to see what the aliens have in store in terms of

817
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,000
when we talk about mind.

818
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,680
Has their minds developed the same way ours has?

819
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:02,720
Has evolution fine-tuned their mind with the same biases?

820
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,040
And it's not that difficult.

821
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,040
Maybe they were completely different.

822
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:08,880
You know, the mind just assumes that it's the only form it could take.

823
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,600
Maybe there's a thousand different versions the mind could take.

824
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,600
So yeah, I don't know.

825
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:41,760
I'm looking forward to that moment, though.
