00:00.000 --> 00:10.520
What happens is that when we're insecure because of rapid change, we tend to react by saying,

00:10.520 --> 00:17.740
this is what worked in the past, and we become more committed to doing precisely what we

00:17.740 --> 00:19.040
did in the past.

00:19.040 --> 00:37.200
So we try to impose past solutions on future problems, but that doesn't work.

00:37.200 --> 00:42.760
Hello and welcome to the 66th episode of Near Human Podcasts at Magabahari Edicologist

00:42.760 --> 00:48.040
on Twitter and Instagram, and you can follow this show on liveinlimbo.com, iTunes, YouTube,

00:48.040 --> 00:49.120
and BitChute.

00:49.120 --> 00:54.480
And today with me, I have the pleasure of having William Davido, the legend of Silicon

00:54.480 --> 00:55.480
Valley.

00:55.480 --> 00:58.200
Thank you so much for your time and being here, Bill.

00:58.200 --> 01:00.280
Well, thank you for having me.

01:00.280 --> 01:01.280
Yeah, absolutely.

01:01.280 --> 01:03.160
It's an honor.

01:03.160 --> 01:07.960
Just to give our audience some more familiarity with you, let's start with your background,

01:07.960 --> 01:11.760
the work you've done, the lives you've lived, and what are you mainly focused on now these

01:11.760 --> 01:12.760
days?

01:12.760 --> 01:25.080
Okay, well, you know, in 1957, I thought I would save the world from Russia when Sputnik

01:25.080 --> 01:26.080
was launched.

01:26.080 --> 01:27.080
How old were you then?

01:27.080 --> 01:32.040
Oh, I was 22.

01:32.040 --> 01:37.280
And the professor announced that Russia had launched Sputnik, and I thought if you have

01:37.280 --> 01:44.920
a grain of technology in your blood, you better study technology and help us win the space

01:44.920 --> 01:45.920
race.

01:45.920 --> 01:50.280
And that started me on a path that led me to Silicon Valley.

01:50.280 --> 01:55.800
And I ultimately ended up running the microprocessor area at Intel and then doing some venture

01:55.800 --> 02:07.560
capitalism, and then at some point, I decided I would try and write a book.

02:07.560 --> 02:13.520
So I did, and you are about to talk to me about my most recent book.

02:13.520 --> 02:18.240
Absolutely, which the book is called The Autonomous Revolution Reclaiming the Future.

02:18.240 --> 02:19.780
We have sold to machines.

02:19.780 --> 02:22.920
You were with Intel since the very beginning, am I right?

02:22.920 --> 02:26.120
Well, I joined them in 1973.

02:26.120 --> 02:30.840
They were five years old, but they were $66 million.

02:30.840 --> 02:37.160
And when I left them in 1985, we were $1.6 billion.

02:37.160 --> 02:38.160
Wow.

02:38.160 --> 02:44.960
Are you impressed by the kind of advancement in chip making and hardware, considering you

02:44.960 --> 02:49.160
know exactly what's been going on, you know the evolution of it, or you're not impressed

02:49.160 --> 02:52.280
because you know all the possibilities that are ahead?

02:52.280 --> 03:00.920
Well, I am tremendously impressed with what we did with the microprocessor.

03:00.920 --> 03:07.900
But you've got to understand that what we did then was very different than what is going

03:07.900 --> 03:08.900
on now.

03:08.900 --> 03:15.880
At that time, with the microprocessor, we were improving the world the way it was.

03:15.880 --> 03:21.600
Like we were making cash registers better and stoplights better and things like that.

03:21.600 --> 03:27.400
And that's very different than what is going on now, where we're changing the social structure

03:27.400 --> 03:29.120
of the world.

03:29.120 --> 03:34.280
And if I look back on it, the rate of advance was really slow.

03:34.280 --> 03:39.160
We were doubling chip density at the rate of 40% a year.

03:39.160 --> 03:43.120
That's a factor of a thousand in 20 years.

03:43.120 --> 03:49.120
I suspect that the internet reduced the cost of communication by a factor of a million,

03:49.120 --> 03:51.600
probably in less than 10 years.

03:51.600 --> 03:57.800
So we're dealing with rates of change or rates of improvement that are a thousand times faster

03:57.800 --> 04:00.800
than what the semiconductor did.

04:00.800 --> 04:06.200
And this rate, would you say, is an inevitable outcome of exponential rate of growth, technological

04:06.200 --> 04:07.200
growth?

04:07.200 --> 04:08.200
Is that right?

04:08.200 --> 04:15.620
Well, it's just all these advances that are taking place in a new world.

04:15.620 --> 04:24.160
We're living in virtual space, which frees us from the limitations of physical space.

04:24.160 --> 04:34.440
And so we've moved from the physical space for which we were adapted to the virtual space

04:34.440 --> 04:40.000
where things happen very quickly for which we're maladapted.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.360
Now before getting into the book, I just want to bring this up for our audience and get

04:44.360 --> 04:50.960
your response to it because you consider what is happening as the third industrial revolution,

04:50.960 --> 04:51.960
I would say.

04:51.960 --> 04:56.240
You tweeted that for the third time in the history of humanity, civilization is undergoing

04:56.240 --> 04:57.640
faith change.

04:57.640 --> 04:59.880
The first was the agricultural revolution.

04:59.880 --> 05:01.680
The second, the industrial revolution.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.720
We are now in the midst of the autonomous revolution.

05:04.720 --> 05:09.440
Now what we are hearing more and more is the fourth industrial revolution that just to

05:09.440 --> 05:14.520
give a definition to our audience, the world economic based on what World Economic Forum

05:14.520 --> 05:15.520
has talked about.

05:15.520 --> 05:18.960
Again, the first industrial is agriculture, second is industrial.

05:18.960 --> 05:24.760
They're saying that the third used electronics and information technology to automate production.

05:24.760 --> 05:29.080
Now a fourth industrial revolution is building the world on the third, the digital revolution

05:29.080 --> 05:32.160
that has been occurring since the middle of the last century.

05:32.160 --> 05:37.120
So how do you see it as only the third, not the fourth?

05:37.120 --> 05:46.480
Well, this is not an extension of the industrial revolution.

05:46.480 --> 05:52.240
The industrial revolution, as far as I'm concerned, has come to an end.

05:52.240 --> 06:00.040
What happened in the various phases of the industrial revolutions is that we made technological

06:00.040 --> 06:09.440
advances, but the forms of our institutions remained the same, like we replaced the handwritten

06:09.440 --> 06:18.260
spreadsheet with Excel, but we still did accounting in firms the same way.

06:18.260 --> 06:23.760
We replaced steam power with electrical power, but we still had factories.

06:23.760 --> 06:30.560
Suddenly, what is happening and why this is not an extension of the industrial revolution

06:30.560 --> 06:33.920
is that the form of what we are doing is changing.

06:33.920 --> 06:37.860
A bank becomes a cell phone application.

06:37.860 --> 06:40.880
It vanishes into virtual space.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.600
That's very different.

06:43.600 --> 06:47.000
The factory did not vanish in the industrial revolution.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.400
It just changed and became more efficient.

06:50.400 --> 06:55.100
Yeah, they're also seeing it as maybe the extension of the third, as they're calling

06:55.100 --> 06:59.880
it, industrial revolution that started in the mid of 20th century by building computers

06:59.880 --> 07:03.280
and chips and then it led to internet and all that.

07:03.280 --> 07:12.760
Yeah, I think the biggest mistake we can make is to think that this is business as usual

07:12.760 --> 07:15.720
with just a little change.

07:15.720 --> 07:20.840
What is happening today is something very fundamental.

07:20.840 --> 07:24.940
Think of what happened during the agricultural revolution.

07:24.940 --> 07:29.480
We had the agricultural revolution and the form of government changed.

07:29.480 --> 07:35.280
We went from being tribal chiefs to having kings and city states.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.360
We used to deal with barter.

07:37.360 --> 07:42.880
We invented money and suddenly we had exchange and markets.

07:42.880 --> 07:48.320
When the industrial revolution came along, we changed very differently.

07:48.320 --> 07:52.900
Most of us prior to the industrial revolution were entrepreneurs.

07:52.900 --> 07:59.120
We worked on farms and lived by what we produced or we were in a cottage industry and made

07:59.120 --> 08:02.800
clothes and shoes that we sold to others.

08:02.800 --> 08:07.560
After the industrial revolution, we became a dependent civilization.

08:07.560 --> 08:13.360
We depended on others to pay us to do work.

08:13.360 --> 08:19.540
That happened that we created the job as a result of that.

08:19.540 --> 08:23.720
Before the industrial revolution, we had small government.

08:23.720 --> 08:33.040
After the industrial revolution, government grew from 3% of GDP to around 40% of GDP today.

08:33.040 --> 08:38.560
These are things and those are what we call social phase changes.

08:38.560 --> 08:44.720
They are very different from just improving the efficiency of society.

08:44.720 --> 08:47.240
What made you write this book at this point?

08:47.240 --> 08:51.520
Was it any specific kind of an event or you just see the trend that is building writing

08:51.520 --> 08:57.640
the book The Autonomous Revolution Reclaiming the Future We've Sold to Machines?

08:57.640 --> 09:01.680
I had three objectives in writing the book.

09:01.680 --> 09:05.920
Number one, I like to write, so it's kind of fun.

09:05.920 --> 09:09.080
It's kind of like being a painter.

09:09.080 --> 09:14.080
The other one was I thought it would be fun to talk to local groups just to get to know

09:14.080 --> 09:16.440
people in the community better.

09:16.440 --> 09:23.040
The third one was the thing I really hope will happen, which is that I hope that I could

09:23.040 --> 09:34.240
influence the thinking of a thousand policymakers so that we wouldn't just treat this as being

09:34.240 --> 09:37.480
just a little bit different than in the past.

09:37.480 --> 09:44.600
We're going to have to think about how we distribute wealth in the future.

09:44.600 --> 09:54.040
You see, in the past, the fundamental mechanism for distributing wealth was the job.

09:54.040 --> 09:58.040
That's how we put money in people's pockets.

09:58.040 --> 10:05.880
If there was a shortage of work, then a lot of people can't participate in that mechanism.

10:05.880 --> 10:12.940
We've got to think about new mechanisms for distributing wealth.

10:12.940 --> 10:15.920
How well do you see our politicians doing this job?

10:15.920 --> 10:21.840
So far, I only can think of Andrew Yang, who's been talking about the... I'm talking about

10:21.840 --> 10:26.000
him beyond the partisan kind of structure because the partisan structure seems to be

10:26.000 --> 10:32.440
counter to measures that need to be taken in order to adopt into what's coming technologically

10:32.440 --> 10:33.800
speaking.

10:33.800 --> 10:44.100
What happens is that when we're insecure because of rapid change, we tend to react by saying,

10:44.100 --> 10:51.340
this is what worked in the past, and we become more committed to doing precisely what we

10:51.340 --> 10:52.800
did in the past.

10:52.800 --> 11:01.160
We try to impose past solutions on future problems.

11:01.160 --> 11:04.300
That doesn't work.

11:04.300 --> 11:09.320
New problems require new solutions.

11:09.320 --> 11:12.200
We have to do those things.

11:12.200 --> 11:17.840
Most of what people are talking about, as far as I'm concerned today, is they're talking

11:17.840 --> 11:24.840
about doing conventional solutions to future problems.

11:24.840 --> 11:30.520
I hope that the free market will create lots of jobs.

11:30.520 --> 11:36.680
I hope that by reducing taxes and getting rid of red tape, it will do enough.

11:36.680 --> 11:46.080
I hope that by creating, moving more manufacturing back, it will help solve the problem.

11:46.080 --> 11:54.400
But I would like to give you sort of a counter example here to think about.

11:54.400 --> 12:00.720
Every time we have gone through one of these social phase changes, we have dramatically

12:00.720 --> 12:07.640
changed the physical infrastructure of our society, like we went from living on farms

12:07.640 --> 12:10.920
to living in cities.

12:10.920 --> 12:17.120
In the future, with the autonomous revolution, it is highly likely that we will have a different

12:17.120 --> 12:22.000
physical infrastructure associated with our society.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.440
I'm not talking about fixing sewers.

12:24.440 --> 12:32.740
I'm saying, hey, maybe people will want to repurpose office buildings and shopping centers.

12:32.740 --> 12:39.440
Maybe they will want to return to living in living cities, which will have more parks.

12:39.440 --> 12:44.400
Maybe they will think sitting in traffic for two hours isn't a good idea.

12:44.400 --> 12:49.640
They're going to want more public transportation, all of those things.

12:49.640 --> 12:54.840
Today we spend 5% of the gross national product on construction.

12:54.840 --> 13:01.200
Maybe in the future we'll be spending 10 or 15% on construction because we will be rebuilding

13:01.200 --> 13:06.260
our physical environment to match the needs of the future.

13:06.260 --> 13:08.520
That would create a lot of jobs.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.840
It's a matter of prioritization too, right?

13:10.840 --> 13:17.240
It takes a body, whether a government or a corporation or whoever, to detect problems,

13:17.240 --> 13:19.560
prioritize them, and come up with solutions.

13:19.560 --> 13:24.320
It just seems like this debacle of bureaucracy that is happening, for example, in the United

13:24.320 --> 13:30.720
States, politically speaking, is just counterproductive to the measures that need to be taken appropriately

13:30.720 --> 13:33.720
to the speed of technological growth.

13:33.720 --> 13:40.400
I believe that there are conservative solutions to the problem, and I believe there are liberal

13:40.400 --> 13:42.860
solutions to the problem.

13:42.860 --> 13:53.400
What is important is that you say, I've got a purpose and a goal, and we all get behind

13:53.400 --> 14:03.800
a certain set of solutions and work to make them work.

14:03.800 --> 14:06.880
Maybe we're not going to pick the optimum solution.

14:06.880 --> 14:12.880
When I was in business, we seldom picked the perfect solution, but as a management team

14:12.880 --> 14:18.800
at Intel, we all said, hey, we've done the best we could to find the solution.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.800
Now let's make the solution work.

14:21.800 --> 14:25.340
That's what we did during the Second World War.

14:25.340 --> 14:28.240
That's what we've done when we faced other crises.

14:28.240 --> 14:32.280
We've made the solution we picked work.

14:32.280 --> 14:35.240
I think this is a very interesting time to talk about solutions too.

14:35.240 --> 14:40.800
We're going through this coronavirus pandemic and see how quickly they respond to it with

14:40.800 --> 14:46.760
respect to coming up with solutions.

14:46.760 --> 14:54.420
That's an example of the fact that probably the biggest threats in our future are going

14:54.420 --> 14:58.760
to be pandemics and bioterrorism.

14:58.760 --> 15:07.640
This one should have convinced us that a pandemic can be a pretty devastating thing.

15:07.640 --> 15:16.880
If you look at it, we have had SARS and MERS and things like this that we've gotten control

15:16.880 --> 15:20.520
of because they weren't quite as bad.

15:20.520 --> 15:24.600
Now we're faced with something that's a real challenge.

15:24.600 --> 15:29.280
We've got to put in place new kinds of solutions to deal with this.

15:29.280 --> 15:30.280
Yeah, absolutely.

15:30.280 --> 15:34.640
Would you talk about some of the elements of this autonomous revolution?

15:34.640 --> 15:39.180
For a lot of people, autonomous cars now becoming more and more familiar kind of an aspect,

15:39.180 --> 15:43.480
but obviously this is not something that is going to be limited to autonomous cars.

15:43.480 --> 15:44.480
No.

15:44.480 --> 15:51.920
What I think is going to happen is that our institutions quite broadly are going to be

15:51.920 --> 15:53.920
restructured.

15:53.920 --> 16:01.740
For example, I looked at finance during this, 8 million people are employed in finance.

16:01.740 --> 16:07.160
What finance is, is basically an information application.

16:07.160 --> 16:14.320
If you look at it, you've got a bank and it's a physical building, but it's an information

16:14.320 --> 16:15.320
application.

16:15.320 --> 16:19.500
What goes on inside it is all information processing.

16:19.500 --> 16:24.240
We're matching buyers and sellers and doing things like this and we're transferring money

16:24.240 --> 16:31.280
around and suddenly we can do all of that virtually.

16:31.280 --> 16:36.360
We may even have new forms of money.

16:36.360 --> 16:43.040
There is an example of the autonomous revolution in finance and maybe 8 million people work

16:43.040 --> 16:44.700
in finance today.

16:44.700 --> 16:49.840
In the future, it could be 4 million, it could be 2 million, but it's obvious that a lot

16:49.840 --> 16:52.320
of things are going to be happening.

16:52.320 --> 16:57.800
If you look across the business world, what I tell people is, look at that office building.

16:57.800 --> 17:06.580
It's got offices and elevators and desks and it's got information network.

17:06.580 --> 17:08.200
People talk to one another.

17:08.200 --> 17:18.120
They send around notes and they're on computer files and then it's got a memory or a file

17:18.120 --> 17:19.120
network.

17:19.120 --> 17:24.120
People store stuff in their brains and it's in file cabinets and it's on the network and

17:24.120 --> 17:29.960
it's got an audio response system, people talking on the phone and an audio recognition

17:29.960 --> 17:34.480
system, people listening when phone calls come in and all of that can be a few racks

17:34.480 --> 17:41.080
of electronics and suddenly you move a call center that employs 2,000 people in India

17:41.080 --> 17:44.380
to a few boxes of electronics in North Dakota.

17:44.380 --> 17:48.960
These are the kinds of transmissions that happen when you move things from a physical

17:48.960 --> 17:51.160
world to a virtual world.

17:51.160 --> 17:56.920
I think what freaks people out a lot is this comparison that the job that 2,000 people

17:56.920 --> 18:00.280
are doing, it can be done by a few racks of computation.

18:00.280 --> 18:06.640
They cannot just grasp that, hey, I can be replaced, what I'm offering can be replaced,

18:06.640 --> 18:11.320
but not only that, it's that people are not realizing that we've already started merging

18:11.320 --> 18:15.200
with technology and machines since we started using tools.

18:15.200 --> 18:16.960
They don't see it like that.

18:16.960 --> 18:24.960
Well, look, there are a lot of things that we don't see.

18:24.960 --> 18:34.040
For example, there's a lot of socially useful work that has zero monetary value in our society.

18:34.040 --> 18:39.040
I look at it and if you are raising children and you want to go to the office, you drop

18:39.040 --> 18:43.880
them off with childcare and pay somebody to take care of them.

18:43.880 --> 18:48.600
Did we ever think about paying people to stay at home and raise their children?

18:48.600 --> 18:56.440
Well, we'll give you money to subsidize childcare, but if you have somebody else do it, we won't

18:56.440 --> 19:00.000
give you money to raise your own kids.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.240
We're going to have to be willing to think about adopting different perspectives.

19:04.240 --> 19:09.000
I'm not saying that's the right solution to the problem, but we're going to have to think

19:09.000 --> 19:10.880
differently in the future.

19:10.880 --> 19:15.160
Yeah, absolutely, because it's very obvious that any technology works as well as a society

19:15.160 --> 19:16.880
that adopts it.

19:16.880 --> 19:20.480
One of the reasons that I'm bringing these up, because I think, for example, Google Glass

19:20.480 --> 19:26.080
was a very good example that, and we've talked about this before, that it was not even available

19:26.080 --> 19:27.080
to be bought.

19:27.080 --> 19:31.840
It had to be given to certain people creating this elite group of individuals in San Francisco

19:31.840 --> 19:37.400
and area and in many cases they were getting attacked by people who were not wearing those

19:37.400 --> 19:38.400
glasses.

19:38.400 --> 19:44.160
Yeah, well, I mean, I don't know how to respond to that.

19:44.160 --> 19:49.600
Well one of the responses that I got from the chairman of transhumanist party here in

19:49.600 --> 19:53.800
the US was that people felt they're being left out, that this is something that they

19:53.800 --> 19:54.800
can't even buy.

19:54.800 --> 19:59.680
It has to be given to them by a company and creating this elite group of people was not

19:59.680 --> 20:02.560
something that was received well by the community.

20:02.560 --> 20:19.120
Well I think we have a problem with elitism in the country today and you know, when I

20:19.120 --> 20:29.120
came to Silicon Valley, which was 1959, it was really egalitarian and we valued people

20:29.120 --> 20:38.080
by what they contributed and when I say that, I mean, I think we valued policemen and school

20:38.080 --> 20:52.360
teachers and everybody and it was my experience that the managements of those companies were

20:52.360 --> 20:54.080
really very egalitarian.

20:54.080 --> 21:01.680
I mean, I worked for Hewlett Packard and Dave Packard used to cook the hamburgers at the

21:01.680 --> 21:11.040
company picnic and he was out in the community and he was on the factory floor and Dave Packard

21:11.040 --> 21:20.000
valued people based on their values and what they contributed and not on their net worth.

21:20.000 --> 21:25.920
Yeah, we have to deal with it, absolutely.

21:25.920 --> 21:33.240
Let's talk about use autonomous vehicles as an example because the information that is

21:33.240 --> 21:41.280
being harvested in order to make an autonomous system functional, one of the concerns is

21:41.280 --> 21:46.160
that that set of data will be owned by a centralized structure of authority, whether it's going

21:46.160 --> 21:52.120
to be Google or whether it's Microsoft or any other company and this would just continue

21:52.120 --> 21:57.520
this trend of getting users data without paying them any compensation or the users having

21:57.520 --> 22:00.000
any kind of a control over their data.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.400
How are we going to deal with moving forward?

22:03.400 --> 22:13.600
Well, I fundamentally believe that there is no freedom if you don't have privacy and that

22:13.600 --> 22:21.520
is an issue that as far as I'm concerned, maybe we'll develop technologies like blockchain

22:21.520 --> 22:28.120
that will enable us to do this but I think it's a government issue and I believe that

22:28.120 --> 22:35.480
I should own my own information and if you look at it, let me give you the example.

22:35.480 --> 22:40.640
My capital equipment is my car and my computer and my cell phone.

22:40.640 --> 22:50.440
I am using my capital equipment and the people who are appropriating my data are using the

22:50.440 --> 22:53.880
product that I produced on my capital equipment.

22:53.880 --> 22:59.480
If I was running a factory using my capital equipment, putting product on the shipping

22:59.480 --> 23:06.840
dock and you were taking it off the shipping dock, you'd be in jail and because this stuff

23:06.840 --> 23:15.800
is intangible, we don't deal with it the same way that we do with tangible things but the

23:15.800 --> 23:23.220
world of the future, intangible things have in many cases more valuable than tangible

23:23.220 --> 23:33.000
ones but the law hasn't caught up with it.

23:33.000 --> 23:47.520
If I write a song, people can take it from me and not compensate me now and these new

23:47.520 --> 23:53.320
technologies make a lot of things possible that were not possible in the past and they

23:53.320 --> 24:01.760
make cybercrime possible but they make new kinds of theft possible as well and one of

24:01.760 --> 24:06.880
the things that you're stealing from me is my privacy.

24:06.880 --> 24:10.480
Whenever we talk about universal basic income because that seems to be like an inevitable

24:10.480 --> 24:14.800
kind of step for people who will be losing their job, my opinion is that why can't we

24:14.800 --> 24:22.680
get paid for the data that we produce and share with these companies based on the contribution?

24:22.680 --> 24:30.240
One of the things that we suggested in the book was that we create information fiduciaries

24:30.240 --> 24:37.480
where all of that data would be resident with the information fiduciary kind of like a safety

24:37.480 --> 24:44.120
deposit box and then that as the owner of this, if I wanted free stuff from Google,

24:44.120 --> 24:51.000
I could say you can have this kind of data or if I wanted to buy automobile insurance,

24:51.000 --> 24:56.720
I could say here is my automobile, here's my driver's record, you can have access to

24:56.720 --> 25:04.360
it or other things but I would put me in control of my data and who gets to use it and that

25:04.360 --> 25:06.720
way I could monetize it.

25:06.720 --> 25:11.640
That would probably, I'm guessing, generate a few thousand dollars a year in income for

25:11.640 --> 25:13.680
individuals as well.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.680
And it also be decentralized, right?

25:15.680 --> 25:18.960
Because you're not going to be dependent on, for example, only Google because you can't

25:18.960 --> 25:23.180
decide to share a data with Amazon and then Facebook and what and what and you get money

25:23.180 --> 25:25.440
from all those decentralized sources.

25:25.440 --> 25:29.440
Yeah, and there are other solutions to this.

25:29.440 --> 25:41.520
I've been reading about blockchain and they have a different solution to the problem but

25:41.520 --> 25:50.800
it's obvious that we should do something and when I say one of the things I didn't like

25:50.800 --> 25:56.560
about writing the book is that the publisher said, well, you've got to give us a few solutions

25:56.560 --> 26:04.560
and I said, well, all right, I'll propose something but what I want people to understand

26:04.560 --> 26:14.240
is that there are many solutions to the problem and so I've defined one but there could be

26:14.240 --> 26:21.960
numerous others in case I said an information fiduciary, if you talk to Dan Tapscott, he

26:21.960 --> 26:29.640
would say, hey, blockchain is the way to do it and I don't care how we arrive at the solution,

26:29.640 --> 26:33.680
I just want to see people owning their own information.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.560
But you're optimistic about blockchain?

26:35.560 --> 26:40.920
Well, I think blockchain is a phenomenal technology.

26:40.920 --> 27:01.240
The question is how will we get it embedded in society and it may or may not happen.

27:01.240 --> 27:02.800
I don't take it as a given.

27:02.800 --> 27:08.760
I mean, I think there are going to be lots of important applications but as to whether

27:08.760 --> 27:14.680
it will be the universal solution to a lot of these problems, I'm not equipped to say.

27:14.680 --> 27:19.160
Yeah, perhaps the best known application on blockchain are cryptocurrencies at this point.

27:19.160 --> 27:23.800
Do you see cryptocurrencies as automating a financial system?

27:23.800 --> 27:33.720
I see cryptocurrencies as extremely important and not necessarily Bitcoin but a cryptocurrency

27:33.720 --> 27:47.360
and the reason why is money is to be a unit of account, a store of value and a medium

27:47.360 --> 27:49.520
of exchange.

27:49.520 --> 27:55.220
The worst people I know to create stores of value are governments because what they want

27:55.220 --> 28:01.200
is inflation so that they can pay off their bills.

28:01.200 --> 28:08.560
It turns out that as a medium of exchange, the fees on transferring money are absolutely

28:08.560 --> 28:15.280
horrendous like we have about $3 trillion transferred through credit cards and debit

28:15.280 --> 28:21.800
cards and we pay about $200 billion in fees on those transfers and interest.

28:21.800 --> 28:24.620
That's about 6%.

28:24.620 --> 28:29.640
Why should I spend six cents on every dollar to transfer a dollar?

28:29.640 --> 28:38.640
That makes no sense at all so it looks like there is a better alternative and I can say

28:38.640 --> 28:44.840
I think with a high degree of confidence that cryptocurrencies are going to challenge the

28:44.840 --> 28:52.640
currencies of many developing countries but I also have a feeling that a good cryptocurrency

28:52.640 --> 28:59.360
is going to challenge the euro and the dollar over a period of time and if that happens,

28:59.360 --> 29:01.960
think about the implications of this.

29:01.960 --> 29:12.000
If you talk about form change, one of the things that has enabled our government to

29:12.000 --> 29:17.560
survive and solve problems is that they have had control over their currency.

29:17.560 --> 29:20.160
They've had the ability to print money.

29:20.160 --> 29:24.320
What happens when you take away the ability to print money from the government?

29:24.320 --> 29:30.520
I mean it's a big change and I think that that could happen.

29:30.520 --> 29:35.560
I don't know if it will happen but I think it's a very real possibility.

29:35.560 --> 29:36.560
Oh absolutely.

29:36.560 --> 29:42.000
We're already seeing that government is being challenged in different ways whether it's

29:42.000 --> 29:47.840
Facebook's Libra that they're going through all of these regulatory things.

29:47.840 --> 29:52.320
They haven't even launched it yet or if it's John McAfee who I had on the show and he's

29:52.320 --> 29:57.360
saying I haven't paid taxes for 10 years and anybody who wants to not pay taxes use

29:57.360 --> 30:01.280
cryptocurrencies that are anonymous like Monera and blah, blah, blah, blah.

30:01.280 --> 30:08.720
Governments are being challenged from many different directions already.

30:08.720 --> 30:09.720
Do you have anything to add?

30:09.720 --> 30:15.320
I want to talk about ethics a little because ethics and morality seems to be a very important

30:15.320 --> 30:20.800
yet very blurry aspect of all of this autonomous kind of a world.

30:20.800 --> 30:35.960
Well see we are living in a world where trust has been undermined and I'm going to give

30:35.960 --> 30:46.080
you a real old world example from about 1950 or 60.

30:46.080 --> 30:52.600
When Sonia and I got married in 1965, a lot of my parents and their friends used to go

30:52.600 --> 31:03.000
to Europe and they shopped at a store that sold fine china named Goods and we got china

31:03.000 --> 31:06.940
from people who were at Goods.

31:06.940 --> 31:13.440
One time Sonia and I went to Europe and we visited Goods and it was a great store and

31:13.440 --> 31:20.340
at some point a piece of china got broken and Sonia ordered a piece of china from Goods

31:20.340 --> 31:28.160
which was in England and it arrived and it was not right.

31:28.160 --> 31:33.880
She informed Goods of this and they said we will ship you a replacement and Goods said

31:33.880 --> 31:39.600
to her and she said don't you want to wait until I have returned the item and they said

31:39.600 --> 31:45.560
no you are a customer of Goods.

31:45.560 --> 31:55.500
We today are living in a world where that level of trust does not exist and we're dependent

31:55.500 --> 32:02.080
upon reviews and this and that and the other thing but one of the things that makes the

32:02.080 --> 32:09.120
economy work and one of the things that make relationships between people work is trust.

32:09.120 --> 32:16.280
And currently things like anonymity on the internet and whether it's fake news or fake

32:16.280 --> 32:22.360
truths or things like this but we have to find ways of restoring trust in the economy

32:22.360 --> 32:24.560
or we're going to have real big problems.

32:24.560 --> 32:32.480
Yeah and with respect to for example autonomous vehicles that famous dilemma I guess that

32:32.480 --> 32:37.600
you have an autonomous vehicle that is on that branch of a road and one there's one

32:37.600 --> 32:41.360
baby and the other one there are like five people which one would you kill.

32:41.360 --> 32:47.160
So whatever kind of decision that is going to be made we go back to this lack of trust

32:47.160 --> 32:50.880
that a lot of people will be like well no the other option would have been right.

32:50.880 --> 32:54.880
It seems like a very big kind of a challenge to solve.

32:54.880 --> 33:04.120
Yeah it is because I mean people make mistakes.

33:04.120 --> 33:09.320
My wife and I were talking about autonomous vehicles and autonomous trucks and I said

33:09.320 --> 33:19.160
there's no doubt in my mind that today even at the state of the technology they are safer

33:19.160 --> 33:28.760
than human drivers and I if I look at that objectively I believe it.

33:28.760 --> 33:38.160
If I look at it emotionally I don't and I say you know I know that I'm not going to

33:38.160 --> 33:47.760
make the same mistake that an autonomous vehicle would but I look at my driving today and I'm

33:47.760 --> 33:54.840
not nearly as sharp as I used to be and I'd be much better off with an autonomous chauffeur

33:54.840 --> 34:02.280
even with the technology at this stage.

34:02.280 --> 34:10.960
But it's hard to trust algorithms because algorithms do absolutely stupid things at

34:10.960 --> 34:23.040
times and you know an algorithm is a rigid rule frequently and you know I said I would

34:23.040 --> 34:31.560
love to write rules that say use your best judgment and algorithms don't work that way.

34:31.560 --> 34:35.440
Yeah there's also alignment issue right like best judgment for humans are not necessarily

34:35.440 --> 34:43.680
going to be the best judgment for algorithms just experiencing different realities.

34:43.680 --> 34:49.840
Considering the exponential growth of technology on the basis of Moore's law that was determined

34:49.840 --> 34:54.480
on the basis of silicon and what I'm hearing is that we are reaching the limits of silicon

34:54.480 --> 34:57.360
and we have to enter a new mode of computation.

34:57.360 --> 35:04.640
Quantum computing is one of the candidates but I'm getting from a lot of experts in the

35:04.640 --> 35:10.560
field that they're not that optimistic about the emergence of a functional quantum computing

35:10.560 --> 35:11.560
anytime soon.

35:11.560 --> 35:15.740
What do you think about quantum computing in specific and the next mode of computation

35:15.740 --> 35:17.700
in general after silicon?

35:17.700 --> 35:30.400
I am not an authority on any of this but what I observe is that I am not sure our limitations

35:30.400 --> 35:36.640
are associated anymore with the power of computation.

35:36.640 --> 35:51.120
We are limited not by the power of computation but by our ability to adapt to the applications

35:51.120 --> 35:54.880
as they are currently being structured.

35:54.880 --> 36:06.920
We do not need more technological progress to make vast improvements in our society right

36:06.920 --> 36:12.400
now, more technological improvements in computation.

36:12.400 --> 36:20.240
What would make us better is if we figured out how to apply the improvements we already

36:20.240 --> 36:33.960
have more humanely and what I've told people is that I consider the recent crop of engineers

36:33.960 --> 36:37.920
to be not very good and they look at me and they say, well, they're all technological

36:37.920 --> 36:46.360
geniuses and I look at them and I say, hey, I'm using this stuff and is it making my life

36:46.360 --> 36:49.680
simpler and more efficient?

36:49.680 --> 37:00.160
The answer is that it does not do 100% of what is absolutely critical to me 100% of

37:00.160 --> 37:02.440
the time reliably.

37:02.440 --> 37:08.760
What happens is that I'm constantly getting bogged down in fringe cases where something

37:08.760 --> 37:17.180
surprising happens and I end up spending an incredible amount of time on a fringe case

37:17.180 --> 37:21.120
that I didn't want to have anything to do with anyhow, but I'm trying to get rid of

37:21.120 --> 37:22.120
it.

37:22.120 --> 37:26.520
I'm looking at this and what do I do with my phone?

37:26.520 --> 37:30.640
I just went through it and spent an incredible amount of time turning off alerts.

37:30.640 --> 37:34.640
Is that an iPhone or Android?

37:34.640 --> 37:41.320
I don't want to say.

37:41.320 --> 37:54.460
To me, that's poor engineering and it's not doing for me what I want it to do or I find

37:54.460 --> 38:01.240
that I've got this wonderful electronic calendar system, but for some reason, the software

38:01.240 --> 38:10.480
is not reliable enough for me to use my phone and be 100% certain that it updates all the

38:10.480 --> 38:13.120
other devices.

38:13.120 --> 38:18.040
When I'm out, I don't enter a new event on my phone.

38:18.040 --> 38:24.640
I check for it on my phone, write it down on a piece of paper and come home or make

38:24.640 --> 38:32.480
myself a note on my phone and come home and enter it on my computer so that I show her

38:32.480 --> 38:36.840
that it gets updated throughout the system.

38:36.840 --> 38:45.680
These things are really wonderful conveniences, but if they don't work 100% reliably, 100%

38:45.680 --> 38:48.160
of the time.

38:48.160 --> 38:50.360
Don't upgrade me.

38:50.360 --> 38:55.560
Figure out how to make the stuff you've sold me work reliably.

38:55.560 --> 39:02.320
We just had our home audio system replaced.

39:02.320 --> 39:09.440
The reason was that we had a sophisticated system and I told the guy I wanted the least

39:09.440 --> 39:17.040
sophisticated system and he swore he sold it to me.

39:17.040 --> 39:26.920
It turns out that I ended up with a sophisticated system that worked most of the time or I have

39:26.920 --> 39:37.040
a thermostat that was online and it got software upgraded and my wife couldn't turn on the

39:37.040 --> 39:40.920
furnace on a cold day.

39:40.920 --> 39:47.880
I cut it off from the internet and I'm now probably 30 versions of software behind, but

39:47.880 --> 39:53.000
the furnace always turns on.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.800
These are things that are really important.

39:54.800 --> 39:57.520
You're so right.

39:57.520 --> 40:00.400
How the masses are going to adopt something like that.

40:00.400 --> 40:04.720
Bill's book is called The Autonomous Revolution Reclaiming the Future We've Sold to Machines.

40:04.720 --> 40:07.280
I have two more questions for you.

40:07.280 --> 40:17.440
What do you think about this 5G and the tech rivalry between the United States and China?

40:17.440 --> 40:30.520
I have for a long time thought that we managed our situation with China not well.

40:30.520 --> 40:38.120
This goes back to trade when I was with Intel.

40:38.120 --> 40:50.840
I believe the Chinese are extremely competent and they do a very good job, but their motivations

40:50.840 --> 40:56.080
are frequently not aligned with our best interests.

40:56.080 --> 41:05.280
In that case, we better find a way whether it's with 5G or with the production of drugs

41:05.280 --> 41:08.620
to be not as dependent upon them.

41:08.620 --> 41:15.820
This doesn't say don't do business with them, but we are overly dependent upon them and

41:15.820 --> 41:25.960
we are not demanding enough that they play by the same rules that we play by.

41:25.960 --> 41:29.800
That doesn't mean that they shouldn't have different rules.

41:29.800 --> 41:37.160
That means that when they interface with us, then we've got to get mutual agreement on

41:37.160 --> 41:43.000
what a fair set of rules are because different societies are going to have different rules.

41:43.000 --> 41:49.600
We can't tell China what rules they should have, but we can say, hey, in the places where

41:49.600 --> 41:56.840
we interact, these are the sets of rules you're going to have to abide by and you can't steal

41:56.840 --> 42:02.040
intellectual property, you can't do this, you can't do that, and if you want to do that,

42:02.040 --> 42:04.240
we don't want to do business with you.

42:04.240 --> 42:05.240
Absolutely.

42:05.240 --> 42:07.560
Thank you so much again for your time.

42:07.560 --> 42:09.000
It's been such a pleasure and honor.

42:09.000 --> 42:13.960
Let me ask you the last question I ask all my guests, that if you come across an intelligent

42:13.960 --> 42:18.660
alien from a different civilization, what would you say is the worst thing humanity

42:18.660 --> 42:22.160
has done and what would you say is our greatest achievement?

42:22.160 --> 42:28.760
God, the worst thing?

42:28.760 --> 42:50.560
Well, I was going to say things like genocides, and then I thought, hey, we have also horribly

42:50.560 --> 43:02.280
abused our environment, and we aren't feeling the effects of that, but we will, and I'm

43:02.280 --> 43:04.680
sorry, what was the other thing you wanted to know?

43:04.680 --> 43:07.160
Our greatest achievement.

43:07.160 --> 43:19.920
Well, our greatest achievements are that we've found, I think, a way of adapting to the physical

43:19.920 --> 43:20.920
reality.

43:20.920 --> 43:21.920
Thank you.

43:21.920 --> 43:49.920
Thank you.

43:51.920 --> 43:52.920
Thank you.
