00:00.000 --> 00:03.740
There's always this problem of, like, what do we do with trance states and what do they

00:03.740 --> 00:05.380
have to do with religion?

00:05.380 --> 00:11.900
In a way, they feed religion, they allow religion to get going, and then once religion's going,

00:11.900 --> 00:16.100
it kind of needs, it sort of needs them to keep going, but then it also has to control

00:16.100 --> 00:20.340
them because they're, they're freaky, they'll undermine your perspective, they'll turn you

00:20.340 --> 00:21.340
into a mystic.

00:21.340 --> 00:32.860
It's like, I don't need a priest, I talk to God.

00:32.860 --> 00:40.400
Hello and welcome to the 52nd episode of Neo Human Podcasts, I'm Agabahari, an agologist

00:40.400 --> 00:48.720
on Instagram and Twitter, and you can follow the show on LiveInLimbo.com, iTunes, and YouTube

00:48.720 --> 00:50.240
as well as BitChute.

00:50.240 --> 00:54.880
And today with me, I have a pleasure of having Eric Davis.

00:54.880 --> 01:01.880
You have a new book called High Weirdness, Drugs, Esoterica, and Visionary Experience

01:01.880 --> 01:02.880
in the 70s.

01:02.880 --> 01:07.760
Tell us a little about your book, High Weirdness, and what made you write High Weirdness at

01:07.760 --> 01:08.760
this time?

01:08.760 --> 01:14.480
I've been interested in these guys for a long time, particularly Philip K. Dick.

01:14.480 --> 01:22.360
I wrote my senior thesis in the 1980s at Yale on Philip K. Dick at a time when nobody was

01:22.360 --> 01:26.160
really paying attention to him, you know, a few science fiction scholars, but he wasn't

01:26.160 --> 01:27.160
famous.

01:27.160 --> 01:30.160
I mean, people knew about Blade Runner, but they thought about the film, they didn't really

01:30.160 --> 01:33.520
care that much about Philip K. Dick, it was before there were a lot of movies made based

01:33.520 --> 01:38.240
on his work, before he sort of had a revival in the 1990s, and I was kind of part of actually

01:38.240 --> 01:43.080
making that revival happen because I wrote a lot about him in the late 80s and 1990s.

01:43.080 --> 01:48.400
So I've been wrestling with Dick's work for a long, long time, and initially this project

01:48.400 --> 01:54.520
was just going to be about him and his so-called religious experience in 1974, these series

01:54.520 --> 02:00.240
of remarkable, quasi-paranormal, quasi-psychotic, quasi-mystical events that happened to him

02:00.240 --> 02:05.000
and really conditioned the last part of his life and his work.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.520
All of his final writings are in some way relating to these series of experiences.

02:10.520 --> 02:14.920
And so I had been able to work on some of his writings at that time, and particularly

02:14.920 --> 02:22.680
he wrote this enormous private diary called The Exegesis, where he called The Exegesis,

02:22.680 --> 02:28.720
and this was not published during his life and nor really intended to, but it remained

02:28.720 --> 02:31.960
afterwards and I was part of the team that helped edit that into something.

02:31.960 --> 02:36.400
So I'd been working with Dick's work for a long time, and I was thinking about this

02:36.400 --> 02:45.160
experience, how do we talk about psychotic-slash-occult-slash-religious experiences, especially in the

02:45.160 --> 02:49.960
era of the 1970s, which I think is a really significant era.

02:49.960 --> 02:55.080
We can talk a little bit more about that later because I think it relates to today in some

02:55.080 --> 02:57.400
really, really important ways.

02:57.400 --> 03:01.000
But I was also just always interested in the era, and so I started thinking about how can

03:01.000 --> 03:07.360
I tell Dick's story against the backdrop of the 1970s, and as I was doing that, I realized

03:07.360 --> 03:12.800
that there were other people who went through not terribly dissimilar kinds of experiences

03:12.800 --> 03:17.680
in different situations, and I decided to choose two of those, Terrence McKenna and

03:17.680 --> 03:23.800
Robert Anton Wilson, and compare and contrast, although I ended up doing less of that than

03:23.800 --> 03:24.800
I had hoped to.

03:24.800 --> 03:30.160
I ended up just providing different accounts of these three guys.

03:30.160 --> 03:33.680
But again, they had very interestingly similar experiences.

03:33.680 --> 03:39.360
There were elements of science fiction, of cybernetics, of futurism, as well as religious

03:39.360 --> 03:46.640
and occult imagery, the paranormal, and also a kind of ambiance of gutter culture, of a

03:46.640 --> 03:49.480
sort of underground ferment.

03:49.480 --> 03:54.600
Have they ever ended up meeting up, Philip K. Dick with Terrence McKenna?

03:54.600 --> 03:55.600
Bless you.

03:55.600 --> 03:56.600
Thank you.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.080
Did I meet them?

03:58.080 --> 04:02.720
No, no, no, have they ever ended up meeting each other, Philip K. Dick and Terrence McKenna?

04:02.720 --> 04:05.760
They actually all knew each other.

04:05.760 --> 04:14.440
I don't believe that Terrence, no, Terrence did not meet P.K.D., P.K.D. did meet Robert

04:14.440 --> 04:19.680
Anton Wilson, but they were aware of each other's work, like P.K.D. wrote about The

04:19.680 --> 04:24.520
Invisible Landscape, the book that Terrence wrote with his brother Dennis in 1975.

04:24.520 --> 04:27.200
He wrote about that in the exegesis and in some of his letters.

04:27.200 --> 04:34.320
So he was familiar with their ideas, and then Terrence later on, again, fairly early in

04:34.320 --> 04:40.040
the revival of Dick, there was an early kind of set of excerpts from the exegesis that

04:40.040 --> 04:44.440
was published called In Pursuit of Valles, and Terrence wrote an introduction to that

04:44.440 --> 04:49.000
where he was basically saying, what happened to Dick was what happened to me?

04:49.000 --> 04:53.180
The same thing happened, because he wanted to sort of make the connection, whereas Robert

04:53.180 --> 04:56.400
Anton Wilson, even though again there are these similarities, he was like, well, there's

04:56.400 --> 05:00.440
some similarities between me and Dick, but a lot of differences too, which is more of

05:00.440 --> 05:05.440
a kind of Robert Anton Wilson way of approaching it, because he's such a pluralist, he recognizes

05:05.440 --> 05:12.040
all these kind of different kind of things that are going on in any given situation.

05:12.040 --> 05:18.720
And the experiences that P.K.D. had, were they with any specific kind of hallucinogenic

05:18.720 --> 05:23.440
or it was across the board, he was just experimenting with different kind of drugs and had different

05:23.440 --> 05:24.440
kind of experiences?

05:24.440 --> 05:30.160
No, that's actually a good question, because in many ways, it happened sort of outside

05:30.160 --> 05:32.520
of the direct context of drugs.

05:32.520 --> 05:42.200
Now, in the 1960s, Philip Dick did try LSD and Mescaline, there's a handful of experiences,

05:42.200 --> 05:46.560
and they were important to him, he referred to them, some of them were quite nightmarish,

05:46.560 --> 05:51.040
and some of them definitely anticipated some of his 70s experiences and the imagery, you

05:51.040 --> 05:58.360
know, he had a famous early trip where he ends up speaking Latin, and intoning these

05:58.360 --> 06:05.600
terms from a Bach piece, and these sort of set up some of the Christian themes that come

06:05.600 --> 06:12.280
up in his later religious experience, but he was mostly a speed user, starting in the

06:12.280 --> 06:18.040
late 1950s, but really ramping up in the early 1960s, carrying through the whole decade,

06:18.040 --> 06:23.760
like lots and lots of brain damaging amounts of speed, but by the early 1970s, he went

06:23.760 --> 06:30.600
through a kind of almost a kind of death and rebirth thing, he bottomed out in Canada and

06:30.600 --> 06:38.720
wound up in a rehab clinic, a really intense rehab clinic, and after that point, he kind

06:38.720 --> 06:43.040
of turned his back on the counterculture, he didn't stop taking everything, I think

06:43.040 --> 06:48.240
he still smoked weed sometimes, and you know, he may have had one or two psychedelic trips

06:48.240 --> 06:52.840
that just kind of fell in there, but he kind of was out of that intense drug culture, it

06:52.840 --> 06:57.320
had been for a number of years when these experiences happened, so you could say, well,

06:57.320 --> 07:01.160
he was already brain damaged, but frankly, the thing about Dick is that if you go back

07:01.160 --> 07:09.920
into his biography, his early biography particularly, he was always non-neurotypical, I mean, he

07:09.920 --> 07:17.000
had a different reality, you know, he was wrestling with psychological symptoms, were

07:17.000 --> 07:22.120
they psychotic, were they paranoid, were they schizophrenic, who knows, because all of those

07:22.120 --> 07:27.560
things are moving targets, and he was diagnosed really early, he started to see shrinks when

07:27.560 --> 07:32.320
he was very young, he started to take psychiatric drugs when he was very young, he took tons

07:32.320 --> 07:39.360
of psychiatric drugs, so he was always a sort of mix of unpredictable psychological

07:39.360 --> 07:45.520
symptoms and drugs, legal and illegal, and you know, whatever, so it's very hard to say

07:45.520 --> 07:51.800
where drugs stopped and Philip K. Dick started, but at the same time, it's really important

07:51.800 --> 07:59.840
to emphasize that unlike McKenna and Robert Anton Wilson, who are both very consciously

07:59.840 --> 08:05.480
taking large doses of psychedelics in order to see how far out they could get, Dick was

08:05.480 --> 08:10.120
not doing that, he was not experimenting that way, in fact, if anything, he was taking massive

08:10.120 --> 08:14.920
doses of vitamin C because he thought that was going to do something, and maybe it did,

08:14.920 --> 08:21.480
who knows, so he was kind of a druggy guy, but he wasn't like pedal to the metal on the

08:21.480 --> 08:24.400
actual substance use at the time that he had these experiences.

08:24.400 --> 08:27.760
You know, it's like what they're saying that the difference between insanity and genius

08:27.760 --> 08:32.960
is so thin and blurry that sometimes people can't really tell the difference between the

08:32.960 --> 08:33.960
two.

08:33.960 --> 08:39.120
I mean, Dick is a better example of that than anyone, in my view, even his books, like his

08:39.120 --> 08:43.880
greatest books, there's something a little fractured about them.

08:43.880 --> 08:47.960
The writing isn't completely smooth all the way through, there's this sort of frenetic

08:47.960 --> 08:51.560
energy and sometimes there's these jump cuts and you're like, where did that come from

08:51.560 --> 08:57.500
or some rough elements in them, and so I kind of feel like one of the great things about

08:57.500 --> 09:02.320
reading Dick is that you get to sort of enter into a mind that has an element in it that

09:02.320 --> 09:08.320
is psychosis or that is sort of, you know, mentally unstable and yet he not only compensates

09:08.320 --> 09:13.480
for it, but he kind of weaves it into his story, you know, on this sort of deeper level

09:13.480 --> 09:19.360
and you're kind of with him as he's processing it personally and telling all these amazing

09:19.360 --> 09:24.040
stories, and these stories just came from his head, like just, you know, he just could

09:24.040 --> 09:31.120
spew them out, you know, he wrote most of his books, which are pretty intensely plotted,

09:31.120 --> 09:35.360
there's multiple characters, the plots don't always quite hold up, but they're very dense

09:35.360 --> 09:40.520
and woe-enriched, and he wrote most of his early books in one sitting, he just sat down

09:40.520 --> 09:44.200
and like had a bunch of notes, some ideas, and he would just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,

09:44.200 --> 09:49.960
sometimes in a week or two weeks, like a whole book, so he had an unusual capacity to tell

09:49.960 --> 09:56.800
stories and to weave together networks of characters in a way that I think is really

09:56.800 --> 10:02.560
singular and quite brilliant, and yet there's a way in which his brilliance is woven into

10:02.560 --> 10:06.640
his psychosis, which some of his less good books, you can almost feel it, it's not just

10:06.640 --> 10:11.640
that they're not very well written, it's that you're kind of in the presence of some

10:11.640 --> 10:16.040
process that's unnerving to you and the author.

10:16.040 --> 10:18.840
Different kind of context, I guess.

10:18.840 --> 10:21.920
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

10:21.920 --> 10:26.760
We are talking to Eric Davis, it's a pleasure to speaking with him, he has a new book called

10:26.760 --> 10:32.560
High Weirdness, Drug, Soterica, and Visionary Experience in the 70s, and it's been published

10:32.560 --> 10:35.800
by the MIT Press.

10:35.800 --> 10:40.680
You mentioned that you want to talk more about, less about summary of your book because you've

10:40.680 --> 10:46.680
been doing it for a while now, the book came out in June or July, and I found it really

10:46.680 --> 10:51.620
interesting that you mentioned you would be interested to talk about how has your experience

10:51.620 --> 10:55.920
has been talking about the book on different kind of setups, on different kind of podcasts.

10:55.920 --> 10:57.760
Would you like to talk a little about that?

10:57.760 --> 10:59.720
Yeah, yeah, sure.

10:59.720 --> 11:02.960
It's actually been more illuminating than I thought it would be.

11:02.960 --> 11:07.600
If you talk about a project you did, often time it gets a little like, oh yeah, I'm telling

11:07.600 --> 11:11.560
the same story, and I didn't want to just keep telling the same story, so I started

11:11.560 --> 11:17.760
to go into what was maybe a deeper interest on mine, what was it about the 1970s that

11:17.760 --> 11:23.760
really interested me, and initially I would talk about, I was born in the 60s, so I kind

11:23.760 --> 11:27.320
of, the 1970s is the first sort of cultural era that shaped me.

11:27.320 --> 11:32.440
I remember things about the early 1970s when I was a little kid, and certain records my

11:32.440 --> 11:39.540
parents had, and television commercials, and pop music, and stuff from that era, so it's

11:39.540 --> 11:46.520
always really interested me, particularly the kind of dark spookiness, because it's

11:46.520 --> 11:52.360
a very strange time in American history, and throughout the world in a lot of ways, but

11:52.360 --> 11:58.960
definitely in American history, because it was kind of the first major bummer era of

11:58.960 --> 12:07.680
America, which is sort of pathologically optimistic, at least until recent decades, and the 70s

12:07.680 --> 12:14.080
was the first real like, wow, this is a bummer, and so I was really interested in that period,

12:14.080 --> 12:17.920
but as I talked about the book, I realized that a lot of ways what interested me was

12:17.920 --> 12:24.040
the similarities between that era and our era today, that if we look back in American

12:24.040 --> 12:29.240
history and go, where is a time that we're going to find some of the same concerns, and

12:29.240 --> 12:35.380
fears, and obsessions, and fantasies, and paranoias, and the same sort of psychic ambiance

12:35.380 --> 12:40.480
that we have today, what's the closest to where we are, is definitely the 1970s, and

12:40.480 --> 12:47.120
particularly the early 1970s, you know, strong degree of social polarization, there were

12:47.120 --> 12:53.760
worries about the environment, and energy, and pollution, there was the terrorist became

12:53.760 --> 12:58.000
a really significant figure with all of the hijackings, that was the kind of dominant

12:58.000 --> 13:03.500
form of terrorism, as well as some of the bloodier gangs in America, and other places

13:03.500 --> 13:07.000
where people were actually dying, and in some ways it was a lot more frightening, because

13:07.000 --> 13:12.720
there was more, even more domestic terrorism than there is today, albeit from left, from

13:12.720 --> 13:17.760
the left, rather than from the right, which is what we have today, and there was also

13:17.760 --> 13:24.240
just kind of a cultural malaise, there was a sense of drifting, of being unsure, as well

13:24.240 --> 13:29.720
as a degree of paranoia, some of our great films of paranoia are from the early 1970s,

13:29.720 --> 13:34.200
like the parallax view, or the conversation, and anybody watching these films, even though

13:34.200 --> 13:38.960
the technology is all analog, and it's not always about technology, it's about politics

13:38.960 --> 13:45.080
too, anyone watching today would feel like a similar kind of like creeping suspicion,

13:45.080 --> 13:50.840
that there's sort of dark shadow behind us, watching us, shaping us, that kind of sense

13:50.840 --> 13:58.080
of paranoia that is partly related to conspiracy theory, the 70s was also a big period for

13:58.080 --> 14:02.960
conspiracy theory, and indeed, that's what Robert Anton Wilson's, in some ways his most

14:02.960 --> 14:09.400
famous book is about, in 1975, he published this book called Illuminatus, that had been

14:09.400 --> 14:16.040
written over the previous five or six years, from the late 60s on, and it's this big satirical

14:16.040 --> 14:24.880
romp, it's this funny, messy, goofy, pulp fiction, brilliant exegesis, just this mishmash

14:24.880 --> 14:32.640
book, but the driving themes of it, are sort of the idea that all conspiracies are true,

14:32.640 --> 14:39.000
and the main conspiracy is about the Illuminati, who again, feature heavily in today's conspiracy

14:39.000 --> 14:42.920
stories, and he was sort of taking the piss out of it, but he was also kind of getting

14:42.920 --> 14:49.640
into it, and indeed, the book has a weird quality, and I mean that term specifically,

14:49.640 --> 14:54.160
that it kind of looks like a satire, he's just making fun of stuff, he's just having

14:54.160 --> 14:59.960
fun as a writer, with his writing partner Robert Shea, they co-wrote the book, but you

14:59.960 --> 15:04.960
can also kind of tell he started getting into it, and he's starting to recognize that there's

15:04.960 --> 15:10.200
real similarities between, let's say, thinking about conspiracies, and thinking in terms

15:10.200 --> 15:17.080
of the occult, or mysticism, and it's no accident that today, both conspiracy theory and occultism,

15:17.080 --> 15:22.280
including astrology, and you know, psychic healing, and all this kind of stuff, is on

15:22.280 --> 15:27.520
the rise again, because there's something about when you enter difficult political periods,

15:27.520 --> 15:32.920
some of these stories become more salient, they become more powerful, and so, as I was

15:32.920 --> 15:37.320
talking about high weirdness over the months, and I had all these great conversations, and

15:37.320 --> 15:41.680
a lot of interest in podcast land, it's a very satisfying thing as a writer these days,

15:41.680 --> 15:45.800
if you put out a book that's interesting, even if it doesn't sell that well, or doesn't

15:45.800 --> 15:50.520
get any recognition from the mainstream, there's usually a whole world of people who are interested

15:50.520 --> 15:55.520
in it, so you get to talk about it, and meet readers that way, and you know, it's a wonderful

15:55.520 --> 16:00.160
thing about the podcast ecology, which to my mind is one of the most positive hopeful

16:00.160 --> 16:04.360
things in our current kind of information environment, but anyway, as I was talking

16:04.360 --> 16:11.420
about this stuff over the months, I became, I started to talk more and more about contemporary

16:11.420 --> 16:15.560
politics in our contemporary situation, like it was less about, oh, let's go back to the

16:15.560 --> 16:21.000
70s and enjoy all these specific details, I mean, that's all in the book, and anybody

16:21.000 --> 16:25.400
who's interested in that period would get a lot out of just the general discussion of

16:25.400 --> 16:34.920
that era, but my own shift is to sort of recognize how relevant these things are today, and I'll

16:34.920 --> 16:41.160
give you one example that was really a nice confirmation.

16:41.160 --> 16:49.520
The current issue of New York Magazine, and if you're listeners, it's worth it to open

16:49.520 --> 16:50.520
up the image.

16:50.520 --> 16:52.520
I'm showing it to them right now.

16:52.520 --> 16:53.520
Oh, great.

16:53.520 --> 16:54.520
Yeah.

16:54.520 --> 16:58.720
The weirdness is coming, so one, they use the term, and we haven't talked about the

16:58.720 --> 17:04.040
term weirdness now, but let's do it next, but I'll bookmark it for now.

17:04.040 --> 17:05.320
The weirdness is coming.

17:05.320 --> 17:11.880
It's about the next 10 years, and it's prediction, like kind of futurism, but not in sort of

17:11.880 --> 17:15.400
that usual kind of technocratic way of saying, oh, in the future, we'll have these kinds

17:15.400 --> 17:18.000
of new technologies and new problems as well.

17:18.000 --> 17:23.040
Instead, it's like, whoa, things are about to get really weird, guys, like you're going

17:23.040 --> 17:30.640
to be afraid of the wind, and malls are going to become massive interactive theme parks,

17:30.640 --> 17:35.440
weird, or actually, we're not really science fiction people.

17:35.440 --> 17:39.600
We're increasingly becoming medieval peasants who don't own anything, and we're like these

17:39.600 --> 17:43.800
digital serfs, and so it's a little more fantastic.

17:43.800 --> 17:46.960
It talks about how science fiction is going to be hard to write because we're going to

17:46.960 --> 17:52.600
be living it, but even more than the fact that they're using weirdness to talk about

17:52.600 --> 17:59.760
the future and the kind of weirdness of the future, not just its scariness or its problems,

17:59.760 --> 18:04.440
but that quality of the weird, which is sort of unnerving, it's kind of mystical, it's

18:04.440 --> 18:09.680
not really rational, it's poetic, it has a certain feeling, but it's also kind of disturbing.

18:09.680 --> 18:15.280
You don't want to live there, and in a way, that's increasingly our general condition,

18:15.280 --> 18:20.920
but it's the cover, the cover art that they chose, which is why I asked you to, it's great

18:20.920 --> 18:24.600
you're showing it, is deeply 70s.

18:24.600 --> 18:31.320
I can go to my bookshelves and pull out a dozen paperback titles with pictures just

18:31.320 --> 18:37.280
like that, including Carlos Castaneda books, so kind of the epitome of psychedelic shamanic

18:37.280 --> 18:39.760
weirdness in the 1970s.

18:39.760 --> 18:45.080
They have covers that are just this kind of style, and so for me, that cover was a strong

18:45.080 --> 18:52.300
confirmation that this sense of the 70s and the sense of weirdness was very applicable

18:52.300 --> 18:58.080
and resonant with our contemporary moment in a very literal kind of way.

18:58.080 --> 19:02.260
Now the connection just that came to my mind, I'm doing a Monday to Thursday livestream

19:02.260 --> 19:09.800
called Beyond Good and Evil, and the main theme of that is how we have moved from centralized

19:09.800 --> 19:14.320
structures of authorities, or we're moving from them, towards a decentralized kind of

19:14.320 --> 19:22.080
a world that has been possible by internet and smart devices, and the similar thing between

19:22.080 --> 19:27.880
what you were saying about the 70s, and right now it seems to me to be to breaking the monopoly

19:27.880 --> 19:31.320
on distribution of information and interpretation of information.

19:31.320 --> 19:35.700
It's really interesting because America had gone through the first psychedelic revolution

19:35.700 --> 19:42.600
in the late 60s, right, and the 70s was kind of getting stuff back together to create some

19:42.600 --> 19:47.680
kind of an order, and exactly because of that kind of an uncertainty, a lot of awesome things

19:47.680 --> 19:49.760
happened and a lot of horrible things happened.

19:49.760 --> 19:53.240
Yeah, no, I think you're really right on there.

19:53.240 --> 19:57.200
I would characterize what happened in the 70s a little bit differently, and I talk about

19:57.200 --> 20:06.240
that specifically in the first chapter of the book where I kind of lay out the 70s,

20:06.240 --> 20:10.680
and one of the main things that happens is precisely what you're talking about, which

20:10.680 --> 20:14.640
is a shift towards pluralism.

20:14.640 --> 20:21.280
It's not the 1960s, it's in the early 70s, when not just avant-garde groups of counter

20:21.280 --> 20:27.800
cultural people, but the society as a whole step towards a multi-centered, multicultural

20:27.800 --> 20:28.800
world.

20:28.800 --> 20:33.680
I mean, in our views today, maybe not multicultural enough, but for that time, quite radically,

20:33.680 --> 20:38.400
where institutions started to acknowledge different identity positions, different sexual

20:38.400 --> 20:45.520
orientations, different genders, the black power movement had opened up a space where

20:45.520 --> 20:52.120
now Native Americans started grabbing a slice of the pie, Chicano started grabbing a slice

20:52.120 --> 20:58.800
of the pie, so suddenly we're in a world where there's more different kinds of ways to be,

20:58.800 --> 21:04.880
and I use a phrase, I call it the centrifugal self, and it's the idea that the self used

21:04.880 --> 21:10.560
to kind of orbit around a central source of authority, and that that authority broke down

21:10.560 --> 21:15.880
at least for everybody who wasn't in the silent majority or the conservative or the Bible

21:15.880 --> 21:22.080
belt side of America in the 1970s, so that authority breaks down and then suddenly, whoa,

21:22.080 --> 21:28.920
you're in this immense centrifuge moving in different directions, drifting, sampling,

21:28.920 --> 21:32.720
trying things out for size, and the place you really see that, at least that I know

21:32.720 --> 21:38.640
really well, in addition to the kind of multicultural society, is that inside the kind of culture

21:38.640 --> 21:44.320
of seeking, spiritual seeking, religious, what's going to replace religion, what are

21:44.320 --> 21:48.720
we going to do next, hedonism, we've been partying for years, and it doesn't get us

21:48.720 --> 21:53.880
far, you know, we're stuck, we need something else, what are we going to turn to, and you

21:53.880 --> 22:03.400
find this enormous explosion of spiritual paths, gurus, sects, practices, you know,

22:03.400 --> 22:12.520
as psychological seminars, as Rajneesh, meditation, blah, blah, blah, so suddenly, like all the

22:12.520 --> 22:20.000
countercultural people, the ones who are seeking, it's this smorgasbord, you know, it's a multiplicity,

22:20.000 --> 22:24.520
and you're right, at the same time, there are new forms of control that are entering

22:24.520 --> 22:29.440
into the picture, you know, it's when we first start really using computer databases to track

22:29.440 --> 22:36.360
consumers, it's when we, when the society shifts to a consumer debt economy, remember,

22:36.360 --> 22:43.480
you know, Nixon takes us off the gold standard, so in a way, the economy is like set loose,

22:43.480 --> 22:47.280
it's like, oh God, where's this thing going? Well, we can use computers to kind of not

22:47.280 --> 22:54.240
only track people, but also help produce a sort of consumer debt culture where people

22:54.240 --> 22:59.260
are kind of buying their way through different lifestyle options, oh, you want to be kind

22:59.260 --> 23:03.800
of a swinger type, here we go, oh, you're into astrology, here you go, oh, you're a

23:03.800 --> 23:09.160
Chicano, hey, we got stuff for you too, you know, so it becomes, in a way, it lays the

23:09.160 --> 23:14.160
groundwork of our contemporary society, like if I look back, it's like, obviously, our

23:14.160 --> 23:20.700
contemporary society is, you know, the origins of it are layered throughout, you know, millennia,

23:20.700 --> 23:28.280
but the technological organization of culture and consciousness that we're sort of, you

23:28.280 --> 23:34.320
know, kind of driving us crazy today, to my mind, you really go back to the early 1970s,

23:34.320 --> 23:39.080
the emergence of the internet, the growth of satellites, the growth of these consumer

23:39.080 --> 23:44.080
technologies of early kind of surveillance devices, I mean, of course, we've had surveillance

23:44.080 --> 23:49.200
farther back, but they get technologized in a certain way that really kind of lays the

23:49.200 --> 23:55.300
groundwork, and even as all of the energies of the counterculture kind of go into this

23:55.300 --> 24:02.800
emerging world, you know, it's not like the counterculture is completely outside, maybe

24:02.800 --> 24:09.120
that was true in 1965 or something, but, you know, it becomes part of Madison Avenue, it

24:09.120 --> 24:14.920
becomes part of culture, culture and consciousness sort of loop around, so that today, you know,

24:14.920 --> 24:23.320
you have something as crazy as like the titans of the most successful global corporations

24:23.320 --> 24:29.960
on the planet are going out to Burning Man and gobbling weird drugs and celebrating this

24:29.960 --> 24:35.660
Dionysian Bacchanalia that looks like the acid tests in digital overdrive.

24:35.660 --> 24:41.040
So that is such a weird paradox if you think about the 1960s when computers were owned

24:41.040 --> 24:46.040
by IBM and straight-laced guys in suits and the hippies are over here playing with, you

24:46.040 --> 24:51.400
know, analog synthesizers and there's no connection between those worlds, there are very little,

24:51.400 --> 24:57.380
and now they're like, you know, and we're like, geez, how do I define myself now?

24:57.380 --> 25:04.600
So again, I think one of the appeal of studying the 70s is that there's a distance so we can

25:04.600 --> 25:10.880
get some sense of distance, some sense of the overall map, and yet in that mirror, we

25:10.880 --> 25:19.200
see ourselves and both the excitement and the creativity of that decentralized experience

25:19.200 --> 25:24.720
you're describing and it's the fearsome sides of it, the scary sides of it, I mean, beyond

25:24.720 --> 25:29.520
good and evil is an exultant place to be and it's a terrifying place to be, especially

25:29.520 --> 25:34.840
when you think about it as a general condition that everybody else gets to discover as well.

25:34.840 --> 25:38.920
Yeah, absolutely, because as you said, it's all about identity and how we are defining

25:38.920 --> 25:45.680
ourselves and how interesting it is to compare removing of centralized orders with what happened

25:45.680 --> 25:48.540
with economy when Nixon got rid of gold standard.

25:48.540 --> 25:51.760
It's like the same thing has happened all around the world.

25:51.760 --> 25:56.800
I'm originally from Iran and Iran is on fire right now and nobody knows what's going to

25:56.800 --> 25:57.900
happen.

25:57.900 --> 26:01.020
Nobody knows that they don't like the government, but nobody knows where they're going, nobody

26:01.020 --> 26:06.000
knows what's going to be the case, but it is the very same thing happening in the United

26:06.000 --> 26:09.840
States that we used to look from Iran to and like, oh, that's a stable place.

26:09.840 --> 26:14.920
We want to go there and enjoy all the freedom and everything, but everything changed because

26:14.920 --> 26:19.840
of the differences of identities and how people are, at least the way that I see it and the

26:19.840 --> 26:24.600
way that people are able to express themselves without going through middlemen.

26:24.600 --> 26:29.880
And I think it is exactly because of that that this is such an interesting time that

26:29.880 --> 26:34.420
it seems like we were experiencing the second psychedelic revolution.

26:34.420 --> 26:40.760
And I want to talk to you a little about the connection between religions and psychedelics

26:40.760 --> 26:47.400
overall and whether or not we are going to witness the kind of coming and creation of

26:47.400 --> 26:53.600
new religions and spiritual path and spiritual practices this time according to the kind

26:53.600 --> 26:55.640
of society that we are experiencing.

26:55.640 --> 27:00.120
John Allegro, for example, he had a book called The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross talking

27:00.120 --> 27:05.120
about the study of nature and origins of Christianity within the fertility cults of the ancient

27:05.120 --> 27:06.880
Near East.

27:06.880 --> 27:16.200
Zeratostrians, they were munching on something called hauma that is coming from soma, that

27:16.200 --> 27:21.940
it's a Vedic kind of a drink that apparently is responsible for creation of Hinduism.

27:21.940 --> 27:28.700
How do you see this relationship and how do you see the creation of new ways to define

27:28.700 --> 27:35.000
ourselves on a basis of religion and spirituality considering this new revival of psychedelic

27:35.000 --> 27:36.640
experimentation and adventurism?

27:36.640 --> 27:38.560
Yeah, that's a great question.

27:38.560 --> 27:43.800
I think I won't talk about the relationship between psychedelics and the origins of religion.

27:43.800 --> 27:50.580
That's a very speculative and controversial topic because there's a lot of sort of suggestions

27:50.580 --> 27:55.280
about things that could be and in some cases we know that there was something like the

27:55.280 --> 28:02.720
soma or hauma or the drink that fueled the Eleusinian mysteries, but what was in it is

28:02.720 --> 28:04.000
a controversial topic.

28:04.000 --> 28:12.280
So let's just say that even beyond psychedelics, the origins of religion lie in altered states,

28:12.280 --> 28:21.760
in trance states, in dreams, in psychedelics, in group ecstasies.

28:21.760 --> 28:25.960
And then over time they develop in all these various different ways, but there's always

28:25.960 --> 28:31.440
traces of those experiences in even conservative religions.

28:31.440 --> 28:36.560
So let's say conservative Christianity, like fundamentalists, anti-drug, maybe get a little

28:36.560 --> 28:39.160
bit of wine, but they're not, they're distrustful of that.

28:39.160 --> 28:45.240
But still, even for those guys, you read the Bible and in the first part of the Book of

28:45.240 --> 28:53.280
Acts, which is what happens after Christ gets out of the grave and takes the elevator up

28:53.280 --> 28:54.400
to heaven.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.320
So they're sitting around and they go, what are we going to do?

28:56.320 --> 28:58.760
And then you have the Pentecost happen.

28:58.760 --> 28:59.760
What happened?

28:59.760 --> 29:00.760
Pentecost?

29:00.760 --> 29:03.720
You read that and it's like, my God, that's like an acid test.

29:03.720 --> 29:07.120
Suddenly they're all together and then everyone's babbling and speaking all the languages and

29:07.120 --> 29:11.280
the fire comes down on their head and they're all like, I mean, Pentecost, there's a reason

29:11.280 --> 29:16.760
that Pentecostals, which we were named for Pentecost, there's a reason that Pentecostals

29:16.760 --> 29:21.160
all around the world are by far and away the most ecstatic of Christians.

29:21.160 --> 29:24.240
They're the ones who are going in there, they're getting totally altered states.

29:24.240 --> 29:29.040
I mean, the theology is incredibly conservative and probably some of them want to kill drug

29:29.040 --> 29:34.960
users and kill queers and I mean, you know, the theology is very conservative, but the

29:34.960 --> 29:40.560
practice is actually pretty wild and you know, you find different mixtures in different religions.

29:40.560 --> 29:44.360
So there's always this problem of like, what do we do with trans states and what do they

29:44.360 --> 29:50.080
have to do with religion in a way they feed religion, they allow religion to get going

29:50.080 --> 29:55.340
and then once religion's going, it kind of needs, it sort of needs them to keep going,

29:55.340 --> 30:00.600
but then it also has to control them because they're freaky, they'll undermine your perspective,

30:00.600 --> 30:01.760
they'll turn you into a mystic.

30:01.760 --> 30:08.120
It's like, I don't need a priest, I talk to God, fuck you, I'm sorry, whatever, I'm

30:08.120 --> 30:10.320
going to go off and do my own thing now.

30:10.320 --> 30:15.840
So religions are always in this tension with altered states and how do you control them,

30:15.840 --> 30:18.880
how do you give, how do you provide them, how do you resist them?

30:18.880 --> 30:20.680
So what's going to happen now?

30:20.680 --> 30:21.680
Very interesting.

30:21.680 --> 30:27.040
I think that the, I mean, it's hard to say exactly what's going to go on with the psychedelic

30:27.040 --> 30:28.040
Renaissance.

30:28.040 --> 30:33.760
It seems pretty clear there's going to be relatively widespread access to psychedelic

30:33.760 --> 30:39.640
medicine one way or another, particularly psilocybin, probably less so LSD.

30:39.640 --> 30:45.360
At the same time, I think Ayahuasca is going to be more and more, even more and more accepted

30:45.360 --> 30:47.080
and recognized as a valid path.

30:47.080 --> 30:51.760
I mean, it's already the case that, you know, investment bankers from Wall Street or the

30:51.760 --> 30:59.720
city in London are going to retreats and saying, oh yeah, Ayahuasca is another sort of golf

30:59.720 --> 31:03.120
club in my bag for how to navigate the world.

31:03.120 --> 31:09.720
So it's already reached a point of mainstream kind of awareness and I think that's just

31:09.720 --> 31:13.920
going to increase.

31:13.920 --> 31:18.280
So we are in this liberalization period of psychedelics.

31:18.280 --> 31:22.640
How is that going to manifest in terms of religion or spirituality, which aren't quite

31:22.640 --> 31:23.640
the same thing?

31:23.640 --> 31:29.140
Let's say religions are more organized, larger, more traditional, more with more connections

31:29.140 --> 31:30.760
to the past.

31:30.760 --> 31:35.160
Spirituality can be all any number of things, although it also has its own, its own history.

31:35.160 --> 31:37.880
Obviously spirituality is a big part of it.

31:37.880 --> 31:44.160
Obviously people, you know, like if you look at, you know, around the world, people who

31:44.160 --> 31:50.480
are interested in meditation, who are interested in yoga, who are interested in these indigenous

31:50.480 --> 31:55.440
traditions, even if they're not indigenous, those people are often very interested in

31:55.440 --> 32:00.840
psychedelics and indeed psychedelics helps fuel their speculations, their experiences.

32:00.840 --> 32:05.400
You know, if you were into the tarot or astrology and then you take psychedelics and you kind

32:05.400 --> 32:10.920
of trip out on astrology, it's going to get more, more astrological, not less, you know,

32:10.920 --> 32:14.560
it's going to get more powerful, more enchanted, more poetic.

32:14.560 --> 32:17.760
So it's a generalized fuel for spirituality.

32:17.760 --> 32:22.060
But I think, but you asked about religion and I think that's the most interesting and

32:22.060 --> 32:24.160
open-ended question.

32:24.160 --> 32:30.960
What are we going to see in terms of liberal forms of Christianity, let's say?

32:30.960 --> 32:31.960
Who knows?

32:31.960 --> 32:36.600
I don't know, you know, there are little bits where you can see already things kind of gurgling

32:36.600 --> 32:39.100
along the sides.

32:39.100 --> 32:43.060
You know, there, I know that there is, there was one, you know, he sounded like a pretty

32:43.060 --> 32:49.840
liberal Sufi guy, but there was one fatwa about ayahuasca that I can't remember the

32:49.840 --> 32:53.000
sheikh's name right now, but he, you know, he laid it out there.

32:53.000 --> 32:59.080
So there's, there's some world out there of like traditionalist Sufism that involves

32:59.080 --> 33:00.080
ayahuasca.

33:00.080 --> 33:04.580
So you're going to find these little zones, there's definitely Zen retreats that have

33:04.580 --> 33:09.400
already been done and even studied where they take mushrooms as part of the Zen retreat.

33:09.400 --> 33:14.040
And then they've studied whether the mushroom, whether the psilocybin actually aids some

33:14.040 --> 33:17.960
of these other features of meditation and they seem to, they seem to allow people to

33:17.960 --> 33:21.420
calm down quickly or get into deeper states, things like that.

33:21.420 --> 33:27.880
So it's, it's pretty clear that, you know, and then ayahuasca depending on the situation

33:27.880 --> 33:29.120
is more or less religion.

33:29.120 --> 33:34.240
There are explicitly religious forms of ayahuasca like the Santo Daime and that's one of the

33:34.240 --> 33:37.400
popular forms of it that people encounter in the West.

33:37.400 --> 33:38.880
So I mean, it's hilarious.

33:38.880 --> 33:44.000
You have like, you know, like out here where I live in the, in the Bay area, you have people

33:44.000 --> 33:51.080
who like look and come from like totally just like hippie surfer, whatever, you know, totally

33:51.080 --> 33:52.600
not religious at all.

33:52.600 --> 33:54.240
Like what, and then they're, what are they doing?

33:54.240 --> 33:58.120
They're putting on black pants and white shirts and black shoes and they're going and they're

33:58.120 --> 34:03.200
dancing like this and they're singing songs about Mary and Jesus and stars and the jungle

34:03.200 --> 34:07.760
to, you know, as they, when they go to Santo Daime groups, I mean, that's religion.

34:07.760 --> 34:13.200
I mean, specifically like Santo Daime, you're all singing the same songs, they're religious

34:13.200 --> 34:14.200
songs.

34:14.200 --> 34:16.520
You're, you're, it's all about building community.

34:16.520 --> 34:22.280
And I think that is the most interesting, whether we call it religion or not, how are

34:22.280 --> 34:28.960
psychedelics going to help us really form new and vital forms of community?

34:28.960 --> 34:33.400
Because the problem with the decent, one of the problems with the decentralized world

34:33.400 --> 34:40.520
that you described, the beyond good and evil world is that when it happens in the context

34:40.520 --> 34:48.880
of late capitalist consumerism with this incredible emphasis on the individual and on self-actualization,

34:48.880 --> 34:52.520
self-improvement, self-realization, I need these things for me, for me.

34:52.520 --> 34:54.320
It's about me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

34:54.320 --> 34:58.100
And we can trace that back to the 1970s as well.

34:58.100 --> 35:02.440
So when you have beyond good and evil and a culture of individualism, you get this problem

35:02.440 --> 35:04.020
of isolation.

35:04.020 --> 35:07.440
You get this problem of disconnection and that makes things worse.

35:07.440 --> 35:11.400
That makes people more paranoid, makes them more angry, it makes it more volatile.

35:11.400 --> 35:15.680
You know, it's a, it's a bummer, you know, and religion, you know, now we can look back

35:15.680 --> 35:20.480
and go, well, religion, you know, it's not so great sometimes, but yeah, there's some

35:20.480 --> 35:22.480
good things about religion and it's true.

35:22.480 --> 35:26.620
There's some really good things about religion, the way it draws people together, it creates

35:26.620 --> 35:28.720
a common sense of purpose.

35:28.720 --> 35:32.480
If it's, if it's an ethical religion, it, even though there's some, you know, the ethics

35:32.480 --> 35:38.440
are usually mixed, you know, don't, don't talk about the queers, but, but nonetheless,

35:38.440 --> 35:44.320
there is a sort of ethical injunction that has a kind of progressive quality to it, even

35:44.320 --> 35:47.040
if it manifests in, in mixed ways.

35:47.040 --> 35:50.840
So I think our, part of our problem now is that it's pretty clear that individualism

35:50.840 --> 35:56.480
is not going to, is not going to help us get through whatever we got to go through.

35:56.480 --> 36:01.960
And when you see it in terms of psychedelics, if you notice, what is the mainstream view

36:01.960 --> 36:03.200
of psychedelics?

36:03.200 --> 36:10.320
What is the most widespread commercialized view of how people take psychedelics?

36:10.320 --> 36:17.600
They go in as individuals into an office that is run by another set of individuals.

36:17.600 --> 36:22.520
Maybe there's two people who sit with them and then as individuals, they go and lie down

36:22.520 --> 36:27.060
on their bed, they put on their eyeshades, they take, they have their trip and maybe

36:27.060 --> 36:30.640
their trip is ecstatic and maybe it's difficult, whatever.

36:30.640 --> 36:33.500
And then that's the way you do psychedelics.

36:33.500 --> 36:34.760
That's the mainstream view.

36:34.760 --> 36:35.920
Does this remind you of anything?

36:35.920 --> 36:37.680
It's totally individualized.

36:37.680 --> 36:40.760
It's totally self-realization, self-healing, blah, blah, blah.

36:40.760 --> 36:43.800
And I, I have no doubt that, I mean, this stuff is great.

36:43.800 --> 36:46.720
That can be very useful for people, very helpful.

36:46.720 --> 36:51.360
I'm not saying that that shouldn't happen, but the fact that that's our main imagination

36:51.360 --> 36:58.880
for it, it tells us that we don't know how to do this kind of work collectively.

36:58.880 --> 37:02.560
And so on the other side of the fence, then you have something like Burning Man, where

37:02.560 --> 37:07.040
you had all these 10, 70,000 people go out there and a lot of them are on drugs and it's

37:07.040 --> 37:14.480
this crazy exploratory, spontaneous, creative, inventive, ecstatic, Dionysian kind of thing,

37:14.480 --> 37:15.480
which is awesome.

37:15.480 --> 37:19.080
And it does help build community in certain ways.

37:19.080 --> 37:22.680
The community of the campmates, you know, all the difficulty of doing that.

37:22.680 --> 37:27.560
And so in a way, I think that the, the fact that on the one hand, we have the guy alone

37:27.560 --> 37:32.680
taking the drug with the blind shades and the other extreme is Burning Man, which is

37:32.680 --> 37:36.800
a kind of gesture towards a politics of community.

37:36.800 --> 37:41.480
It's just, it's not, you know, it's, it's good in some ways and not so good in other

37:41.480 --> 37:42.480
ways.

37:42.480 --> 37:46.880
I think there are other things in between, maybe smaller scale, but ones where people

37:46.880 --> 37:52.280
are much more woven into a kind of collective sense of being in the world.

37:52.280 --> 37:56.440
And the one that interests me the most, which you can say, I don't know, religion is the

37:56.440 --> 38:02.080
right word, is what I would call the kind of new animism.

38:02.080 --> 38:06.640
And this is the sense that's rooted, you know, in profound spiritual experience and many

38:06.640 --> 38:13.040
sacred texts and many poet poetic texts and in our, frankly, in our own childhood experience,

38:13.040 --> 38:17.360
the sense that the world is alive, that the world, the objects in the world are alive.

38:17.360 --> 38:19.600
And you could be a rationalist and go, well, they're not really alive.

38:19.600 --> 38:21.960
And I'm like, okay, sure, fine.

38:21.960 --> 38:24.800
But on some level they are because we're interacting with them.

38:24.800 --> 38:29.800
They have their own things to say, you know, any, all the things in my office have histories

38:29.800 --> 38:30.800
and stories.

38:30.800 --> 38:34.600
They, certain conditions produce them just as certain conditions produce me.

38:34.600 --> 38:36.560
And when I encounter them, it's an encounter.

38:36.560 --> 38:38.320
It's not just me using them.

38:38.320 --> 38:42.320
That's the rationalist view is we just as humans, we just use the world, but the world

38:42.320 --> 38:46.200
is also, it's a world as part of a, it has its own world.

38:46.200 --> 38:49.920
The things in the world have their own world and we're encountering them and psychedelics

38:49.920 --> 38:58.120
really sort of inflame that kind of sense of relationality, that sense of, of the aliveness

38:58.120 --> 39:02.360
of things and that there's a politics in that as well.

39:02.360 --> 39:06.760
There's a way of recognizing how embedded we are in all these different systems that

39:06.760 --> 39:13.640
are non-human and having to kind of recognize the, the alienness and the majesty and the

39:13.640 --> 39:18.720
confusion of our situation beyond the human, you know, so you just talk about beyond good

39:18.720 --> 39:19.720
and evil.

39:19.720 --> 39:21.260
Well, let's talk about beyond the human.

39:21.260 --> 39:25.600
What does it mean to really be alive and awake in a world where you recognize that you as

39:25.600 --> 39:31.520
a human are always completely embedded in all of these non-human systems, technological

39:31.520 --> 39:39.520
systems, media systems, control systems, but also air and wind and water and food and nutrients

39:39.520 --> 39:42.520
and toxins and cosmic rays.

39:42.520 --> 39:48.080
That's a very psychedelic vision, but it's also a very political vision and a very embedded

39:48.080 --> 39:50.320
ecological vision.

39:50.320 --> 39:57.880
And so I'm really interested to see forms of religiosity and spirituality that are involved

39:57.880 --> 39:59.920
psychedelics that kind of move in that direction.

39:59.920 --> 40:04.360
And then I have one more thing to say, which is that we are definitely going to see some

40:04.360 --> 40:07.600
flipped out kooky cults coming down.

40:07.600 --> 40:11.520
There's no way there's not going to be like, cause it's so easy.

40:11.520 --> 40:17.080
You know, you're, if you're a psychologically unsophisticated person, meaning unref, self-reflective,

40:17.080 --> 40:20.160
even if you're sophisticated about other people, but you're not reflective of yourself, it's

40:20.160 --> 40:25.780
totally easy to believe your own BS and think that you've achieved some kind of realization.

40:25.780 --> 40:30.040
You present yourself as a realized psychedelic being, all the people who are insecure are

40:30.040 --> 40:33.280
like, oh, he knows, or she knows, let's surround him.

40:33.280 --> 40:37.840
And then you take it and then you program people unintentionally, even you say like,

40:37.840 --> 40:42.960
oh, we're all part of, can you see the cube, the cube that's formed between us?

40:42.960 --> 40:47.640
And you're like, yes, I see the cube because psychedelics are so responsive to set and

40:47.640 --> 40:52.360
setting to, to programming, essentially you, they're very sensitive to that kind of stuff.

40:52.360 --> 40:58.960
So used consciously or unconsciously, it's very easy for people to get inflated and create

40:58.960 --> 41:01.280
these kind of cult-like situations.

41:01.280 --> 41:03.240
And we're totally going to see that stuff.

41:03.240 --> 41:05.560
There's no way we're going to avoid that.

41:05.560 --> 41:10.400
You know, I just hope it doesn't get so bad that it derails the good stuff that's, that's

41:10.400 --> 41:14.200
coming down the pike, but it's going to get very interesting pretty fast.

41:14.200 --> 41:19.840
Now, what you're saying resonates so much with me on, I just want to mention two points

41:19.840 --> 41:20.840
of it.

41:20.840 --> 41:25.400
Two weeks ago, I celebrated the 10th year anniversary of the first time I ingested psilocybin

41:25.400 --> 41:28.160
mushroom in Vancouver, BC.

41:28.160 --> 41:30.200
And it changed my life completely.

41:30.200 --> 41:36.520
I went from being a complete militant atheist as a result of living for 23 years in Iran

41:36.520 --> 41:43.480
to becoming, I don't know, and really embrace this not knowing and just curiosity to experience

41:43.480 --> 41:45.840
rather than trying to understand.

41:45.840 --> 41:51.920
And for years, I kept hearing about ayahuasca and we were talking about how it's a good

41:51.920 --> 41:53.520
idea to go to Peru and do it.

41:53.520 --> 41:57.480
And I ended up doing it for the first time in Florida, which is where I live now.

41:57.480 --> 41:58.480
It's all over the place.

41:58.480 --> 42:03.040
And what you were saying, the sense of community of it, that people sit overnight, at least

42:03.040 --> 42:06.480
the way that I experience it, sit overnight around a fire.

42:06.480 --> 42:10.000
The fire has its own philosophy, the smoke has its own philosophy.

42:10.000 --> 42:15.600
It can get really religious, but at the same time, it is the sense of community that has

42:15.600 --> 42:18.600
its negative, but it also has its positive.

42:18.600 --> 42:24.000
And the other thing is, one of the most interesting topics to me is how we are going to merge

42:24.000 --> 42:29.240
with our technology in a way that it's happening right now more and more, and how we are defining

42:29.240 --> 42:31.120
what it means to be human.

42:31.120 --> 42:35.160
So one of the questions that I keep asking from AI people and technologists that I invite

42:35.160 --> 42:41.180
on this show is, would you say ethics and morality is objective or subjective?

42:41.180 --> 42:46.520
If it's subjective, then how do we expect to create this new intelligence in a form

42:46.520 --> 42:52.280
of artificial intelligence, if we haven't even figured out what our own values are as

42:52.280 --> 42:53.280
a civilization?

42:53.280 --> 42:58.920
Yeah, that's a really good question.

42:58.920 --> 43:05.720
I'm with those that fear that particularly artificial intelligence in conjunction with

43:05.720 --> 43:11.440
certain kinds of surveillance technologies, in conjunction with certain kinds of, let's

43:11.440 --> 43:16.640
say, ultimately propagandistic meme control or whatever you want to call it, that that

43:16.640 --> 43:22.360
is such a recipe for tyranny.

43:22.360 --> 43:27.840
It's terrifying in its implications if you put your dark science fiction imagination

43:27.840 --> 43:32.280
and you throw it in that direction, because there's certainly not anything inherently

43:32.280 --> 43:40.120
ethical about increasing the capacity to control and to understand and to pattern and to connect

43:40.120 --> 43:47.200
and predict, and all of the drivers of so much of contemporary society, they're not

43:47.200 --> 43:49.720
really about ethical principles.

43:49.720 --> 43:56.480
Do I think that a fully agential artificial intelligence would or would not have ethics?

43:56.480 --> 43:59.520
That's a very interesting question.

43:59.520 --> 44:04.980
I've spent a lot of time around Buddhism, and there are forms of Buddhism that really

44:04.980 --> 44:14.440
try to use logic to undermine a lot of the conventional ideas that keep us locked into

44:14.440 --> 44:15.920
certain egoic positions.

44:15.920 --> 44:22.360
I sometimes fantasize, and I'm not the only one, about somehow programming an artificial

44:22.360 --> 44:28.040
intelligence with the right logical principles that would inevitably lead to this kind of

44:28.040 --> 44:29.880
bodhisattva compassion.

44:29.880 --> 44:36.640
It's a fun science fiction story, but I think it does suggest that we do sense that there's

44:36.640 --> 44:45.280
not going to be anything like inherent ethics that are coming out of these things just naturally.

44:45.280 --> 44:50.080
It's like they have to be part woven into whatever it is that we're doing as we seek

44:50.080 --> 44:54.360
out ethical answers, but ethics isn't looking so great out there on the global scale right

44:54.360 --> 44:55.360
now.

44:55.360 --> 45:02.320
It's like, oops, and it's so hard because for me, it's funny because you're from Iran.

45:02.320 --> 45:09.280
In my own life, I've hung out with a couple dozen people from Iran.

45:09.280 --> 45:12.480
I always have a great time.

45:12.480 --> 45:13.960
I would love to go to Iran.

45:13.960 --> 45:19.620
I know that I would show up, and I would have a great time, but it's also like this place

45:19.620 --> 45:24.800
of fantasy because it's probably not going to happen, at least anytime soon.

45:24.800 --> 45:35.400
But there's this great example of this incredible richness of culture and sophistication and

45:35.400 --> 45:36.400
open-endedness.

45:36.400 --> 45:43.600
I don't know if secular isn't quite the right word, but let's say the free-thinking culture

45:43.600 --> 45:48.800
in Tehran throughout the 20th century was remarkable, even in comparison to all these

45:48.800 --> 45:55.760
places around it, and yet from an American mainstream perspective, what's next to China?

45:55.760 --> 46:04.560
It's like this sort of the most corroded, horrible part of it's like, oh, it's so awful.

46:04.560 --> 46:12.320
There's so many wonderful people that are locked into this situation that we can't see.

46:12.320 --> 46:18.200
Because we can't see them, we can just project a story about crazy Iranians or whatever.

46:18.200 --> 46:27.720
To me, even geopolitically, I'm pro-Iranian, anti-Iranian, maybe whatever, that's another

46:27.720 --> 46:29.560
discussion.

46:29.560 --> 46:34.000
But I always felt that we should have tried to have been better friends with Iran for

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
a lot of reasons.

46:35.000 --> 46:42.520
But that stuff aside, for me, it's always an example of if only we could communicate

46:42.520 --> 46:49.300
more on a level of people and that there was some kind of shared sense of value that would

46:49.300 --> 46:54.520
enable us to get over the inevitable differences and recognize that it's we that are being

46:54.520 --> 47:04.760
oppressed by them on top, and instead of just projecting both ways, it's hard to describe.

47:04.760 --> 47:06.360
No, I totally get it.

47:06.360 --> 47:11.440
The problem with Iran, unfortunately, is that I always consider Iran to be an occupied country

47:11.440 --> 47:15.760
by the Islamic regime because they're an absolute minority, absolute majority of people have

47:15.760 --> 47:18.040
nothing to do with them, they're very westernized.

47:18.040 --> 47:20.280
When I came to Canada, I had no culture shock.

47:20.280 --> 47:25.900
My biggest culture shock, I keep telling people, it was how Western liberals criticized me

47:25.900 --> 47:31.600
when I criticized political Islam that we all suffered under, the theocracy.

47:31.600 --> 47:34.720
But it's just an unfortunate kind of a situation.

47:34.720 --> 47:39.200
Eric's new book is called High Weirdness, Drugs, Esoterica, and Visionary Experience

47:39.200 --> 47:40.400
in the 70s.

47:40.400 --> 47:44.640
Eric, what kind of lessons have you learned or we haven't learned from the 70s that we

47:44.640 --> 47:48.280
can use in this path that we're in at this time?

47:48.280 --> 47:49.280
That's a really good question.

47:49.280 --> 47:54.360
I mean, I think that in a way, some of the most inspiring stories of the 70s, which aren't

47:54.360 --> 47:58.840
necessarily not exactly the ones that I'm talking about, because I'm really talking

47:58.840 --> 48:03.640
about individuals who are like plunging into the depths of the mind.

48:03.640 --> 48:12.840
But the part that I find most inspiring about the 70s is its sense of creative bricolage,

48:12.840 --> 48:14.040
and I'll explain that term.

48:14.040 --> 48:16.200
So it's a term from anthropology.

48:16.200 --> 48:23.040
And what it means is sort of using what's at hand to cobble together something new.

48:23.040 --> 48:26.160
So it's not like you can make something out of nothing.

48:26.160 --> 48:29.520
It's not like you can engineer the perfect form.

48:29.520 --> 48:32.880
You take a bit of this and a bit of that and a bit of this, and then collectively, you

48:32.880 --> 48:34.800
kind of build something.

48:34.800 --> 48:38.160
And this was a way like a lot of communes happened in the early 1970s.

48:38.160 --> 48:40.440
You know, most of them didn't last that long.

48:40.440 --> 48:44.600
But for the period of time that they were living, they were fascinating experiments

48:44.600 --> 48:48.080
and they brought people together in new ways, with new ideas.

48:48.080 --> 48:52.280
And they were like the same thing, like, let's take a little this, take a little that, put

48:52.280 --> 48:53.280
it together.

48:53.280 --> 48:59.360
And in a way, the three thinkers that I look at in the book, they're all bricolors of the

48:59.360 --> 49:01.880
imagination or philosophical bricolors.

49:01.880 --> 49:06.760
I call them garage philosophers, because they're like hacking it out in their garage.

49:06.760 --> 49:08.080
They're tinkering away.

49:08.080 --> 49:11.060
It's not like they're elites.

49:11.060 --> 49:16.240
So there's something about that quality of tinkering, of hacking, of throwing together

49:16.240 --> 49:24.840
this and that, of assembling that is a really strong thread in the 70s that feels appropriate

49:24.840 --> 49:29.920
today in some way, although our tools are so different and how we think about the media

49:29.920 --> 49:31.080
is so different.

49:31.080 --> 49:37.560
But when I look ahead and I really, I can't believe that it's predominantly in the inside

49:37.560 --> 49:42.160
the internet sphere, the communication sphere, the social media sphere, that we're really

49:42.160 --> 49:48.120
going to find our way back to something or not even back, just find our way towards something

49:48.120 --> 49:50.120
that gives us a better handle on things.

49:50.120 --> 49:55.840
I just feel like it has to be in the real world, even as the real world is more difficult,

49:55.840 --> 50:01.920
it's more crowded, it's uglier, it's more surveyed.

50:01.920 --> 50:08.760
All of these not so groovy, more poisoned, more dying, but it's something about being

50:08.760 --> 50:16.720
in the physical world with others in shared projects that seems to me a hopeful way to

50:16.720 --> 50:17.720
go.

50:17.720 --> 50:18.720
Excellent.

50:18.720 --> 50:23.560
I can talk to you for hours, I know your time is precious.

50:23.560 --> 50:27.920
So what's next for you and how our audience can follow your work?

50:27.920 --> 50:28.920
Sure.

50:28.920 --> 50:34.160
The way to follow me is I've had the same website since the mid 1990s.

50:34.160 --> 50:39.320
It's called technosis.com, T-E-C-H-G-N-O-S-I-S.

50:39.320 --> 50:42.800
It's the name of my first book and it's still in print.

50:42.800 --> 50:49.000
So it's one people still like to turn to.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.560
And so that's a great place to follow me.

50:50.560 --> 50:52.360
You can sign up for my mailing list.

50:52.360 --> 50:55.560
I only send one out like once a month.

50:55.560 --> 50:59.480
And as for my next steps, I have a few writing projects that, you know, I'm not talking

50:59.480 --> 51:05.360
about right now, but they're modest and I'm not really sure actually.

51:05.360 --> 51:08.040
There's a number of different things that I'm thinking about.

51:08.040 --> 51:14.380
I did a podcast for almost a decade and I needed a break.

51:14.380 --> 51:19.560
So earlier this summer I went on hiatus and it continues to be a hiatus.

51:19.560 --> 51:24.040
I know I'll return to podcasting in some form or another because I like it so much.

51:24.040 --> 51:28.680
But it's actually a kind of a good time for me to sort of see what's going to come up

51:28.680 --> 51:30.320
and not just dive right back in.

51:30.320 --> 51:37.800
I think in our culture today, especially there's this kind of tension of like, you know, you

51:37.800 --> 51:39.000
always got to be on it.

51:39.000 --> 51:42.480
You got to be like producing, producing, producing, producing.

51:42.480 --> 51:47.720
And if you don't stop and let it kind of break apart or like just kind of throw up a wall

51:47.720 --> 51:53.280
temporarily, you're just going to follow like the kind of immediate path that you're laid

51:53.280 --> 51:54.280
out for.

51:54.280 --> 51:56.000
And that might take you somewhere interesting.

51:56.000 --> 52:01.480
But if you can afford it, you know, temporarily, mentally, whatever, you can just go, okay,

52:01.480 --> 52:02.480
wait a second.

52:02.480 --> 52:03.480
What's okay.

52:03.480 --> 52:04.480
I could go there.

52:04.480 --> 52:05.480
I could go there.

52:05.480 --> 52:06.480
Like what's happening?

52:06.480 --> 52:07.480
What comes out of the bush?

52:07.480 --> 52:09.280
What's what attracts you?

52:09.280 --> 52:11.760
So I'm kind of doing doing that at this moment.

52:11.760 --> 52:18.760
But there's definitely going to be podcasting, events, lectures, writings.

52:18.760 --> 52:23.840
And you know, so so again, the technosis.com and getting on the mailing list is the best

52:23.840 --> 52:24.840
way.

52:24.840 --> 52:25.840
Fantastic.

52:25.840 --> 52:29.240
Before I ask you the last question that I ask all my guests, is there anything else

52:29.240 --> 52:32.640
you would like to add that we haven't got a chance to talk about?

52:32.640 --> 52:36.320
No, that's good.

52:36.320 --> 52:37.320
I'm also on Twitter.

52:37.320 --> 52:39.040
I do Eric Davis to Twitter.

52:39.040 --> 52:40.040
That's a fun one.

52:40.040 --> 52:41.040
I like I like Twitter.

52:41.040 --> 52:47.440
I don't I avoid arguing arguing on Twitter, I've got one or two trolls and I've disarmed

52:47.440 --> 52:48.440
them both times.

52:48.440 --> 52:53.320
I shouldn't say that because that's like a that's like a, you know, I'm not going to

52:53.320 --> 52:55.040
let him disarm me, you know, whatever.

52:55.040 --> 52:58.640
But I you know, I kind of I try to like maneuver through that whole thing.

52:58.640 --> 53:04.800
And so for me, it's a much more friendly and exciting place.

53:04.800 --> 53:09.200
So let me ask you the last question I ask all my guests that if you come across an intelligent

53:09.200 --> 53:14.000
alien from a different civilization, what would you say as the worst thing humanity

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
has done?

53:15.000 --> 53:17.840
And what would you say is our greatest achievement?

53:17.840 --> 53:21.800
So not the way we are, but what we've done.

53:21.800 --> 53:23.280
Yeah.

53:23.280 --> 53:24.280
That's interesting.

53:24.280 --> 53:25.280
That's the difference between us.

53:25.280 --> 53:29.440
Funny that that popped in is like how that how you know, what's the worst thing about

53:29.440 --> 53:34.560
human beings the way they are versus what they've done and the best thing?

53:34.560 --> 53:54.640
That's a push we well, I think I think the the the despoiling of the thoughtless despoiling

53:54.640 --> 54:03.760
of our planetary environmental situation is the worst thing from a kind of cosmic perspective.

54:03.760 --> 54:08.520
Like we've done more horrible things to other people.

54:08.520 --> 54:13.400
I mean, you could say, you know, all the ways we've treated ourselves basically could be

54:13.400 --> 54:16.040
just as just as bad.

54:16.040 --> 54:24.320
But there's something more, even more thoughtless and insane about that, about the environment.

54:24.320 --> 54:29.680
And then the best thing are, you know, art, art.

54:29.680 --> 54:31.040
I mean, for sure.

54:31.040 --> 54:38.600
I mean, what I sometimes think that, you know, if an intelligent alien came to our, you know,

54:38.600 --> 54:43.200
our zone and was like, oh, what's what's of what's the value here?

54:43.200 --> 54:48.720
They would mostly be disgusted, but they go, but you know, there's some good stuff there.

54:48.720 --> 54:57.360
You know, we got a got Taj Mahal, you got, you know, J.S. Bach, you got Thomas Pynchon,

54:57.360 --> 54:59.180
you know, there's some good stuff out there.

54:59.180 --> 55:06.760
So I kind of almost feel like the human experiment, if it's going to be if it's going to be justified,

55:06.760 --> 55:13.360
can only really be justified in in art in the full sense, like art as in a way of living

55:13.360 --> 55:20.960
life, not just of creating objects and being the same, you know, grubby, competitive narcissist

55:20.960 --> 55:26.960
that everybody else is, you know, it's not just the objects, but the art as a pathway.

55:26.960 --> 55:31.960
But I still feel like both of these answers were a little not quite as as it's a tough

55:31.960 --> 55:32.960
one.

55:32.960 --> 56:00.960
But I still feel like both of these answers were a little not quite as as it's a tough

56:00.960 --> 56:03.960
one.
