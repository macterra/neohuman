1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
There's always this problem of, like, what do we do with trance states and what do they

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,380
have to do with religion?

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:11,900
In a way, they feed religion, they allow religion to get going, and then once religion's going,

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,100
it kind of needs, it sort of needs them to keep going, but then it also has to control

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,340
them because they're, they're freaky, they'll undermine your perspective, they'll turn you

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,340
into a mystic.

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:32,860
It's like, I don't need a priest, I talk to God.

8
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:40,400
Hello and welcome to the 52nd episode of Neo Human Podcasts, I'm Agabahari, an agologist

as well as BitChute.

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,880
And today with me, I have a pleasure of having Eric Davis.

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:01,880
You have a new book called High Weirdness, Drugs, Esoterica, and Visionary Experience

13
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,880
in the 70s.

14
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,760
Tell us a little about your book, High Weirdness, and what made you write High Weirdness at

15
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,760
this time?

16
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,480
I've been interested in these guys for a long time, particularly Philip K. Dick.

17
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:22,360
I wrote my senior thesis in the 1980s at Yale on Philip K. Dick at a time when nobody was

18
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,160
really paying attention to him, you know, a few science fiction scholars, but he wasn't

19
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,160
famous.

20
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,160
I mean, people knew about Blade Runner, but they thought about the film, they didn't really

21
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,520
care that much about Philip K. Dick, it was before there were a lot of movies made based

22
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,240
on his work, before he sort of had a revival in the 1990s, and I was kind of part of actually

23
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,080
making that revival happen because I wrote a lot about him in the late 80s and 1990s.

24
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,400
So I've been wrestling with Dick's work for a long, long time, and initially this project

25
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:54,520
was just going to be about him and his so-called religious experience in 1974, these series

26
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:00,240
of remarkable, quasi-paranormal, quasi-psychotic, quasi-mystical events that happened to him

27
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,000
and really conditioned the last part of his life and his work.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,520
All of his final writings are in some way relating to these series of experiences.

29
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,920
And so I had been able to work on some of his writings at that time, and particularly

30
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:22,680
he wrote this enormous private diary called The Exegesis, where he called The Exegesis,

31
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,720
and this was not published during his life and nor really intended to, but it remained

32
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,960
afterwards and I was part of the team that helped edit that into something.

33
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,400
So I'd been working with Dick's work for a long time, and I was thinking about this

34
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:45,160
experience, how do we talk about psychotic-slash-occult-slash-religious experiences, especially in the

35
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,960
era of the 1970s, which I think is a really significant era.

36
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:55,080
We can talk a little bit more about that later because I think it relates to today in some

37
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,400
really, really important ways.

38
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,000
But I was also just always interested in the era, and so I started thinking about how can

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,360
I tell Dick's story against the backdrop of the 1970s, and as I was doing that, I realized

40
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,800
that there were other people who went through not terribly dissimilar kinds of experiences

41
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,680
in different situations, and I decided to choose two of those, Terrence McKenna and

42
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,800
Robert Anton Wilson, and compare and contrast, although I ended up doing less of that than

43
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
I had hoped to.

44
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,160
I ended up just providing different accounts of these three guys.

45
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,680
But again, they had very interestingly similar experiences.

46
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,360
There were elements of science fiction, of cybernetics, of futurism, as well as religious

47
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:46,640
and occult imagery, the paranormal, and also a kind of ambiance of gutter culture, of a

48
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,480
sort of underground ferment.

49
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,600
Have they ever ended up meeting up, Philip K. Dick with Terrence McKenna?

50
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Bless you.

51
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Thank you.

52
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,080
Did I meet them?

53
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,720
No, no, no, have they ever ended up meeting each other, Philip K. Dick and Terrence McKenna?

54
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,760
They actually all knew each other.

55
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:14,440
I don't believe that Terrence, no, Terrence did not meet P.K.D., P.K.D. did meet Robert

56
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,680
Anton Wilson, but they were aware of each other's work, like P.K.D. wrote about The

57
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,520
Invisible Landscape, the book that Terrence wrote with his brother Dennis in 1975.

58
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,200
He wrote about that in the exegesis and in some of his letters.

59
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:34,320
So he was familiar with their ideas, and then Terrence later on, again, fairly early in

60
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,040
the revival of Dick, there was an early kind of set of excerpts from the exegesis that

61
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,440
was published called In Pursuit of Valles, and Terrence wrote an introduction to that

62
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,000
where he was basically saying, what happened to Dick was what happened to me?

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,180
The same thing happened, because he wanted to sort of make the connection, whereas Robert

64
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,400
Anton Wilson, even though again there are these similarities, he was like, well, there's

65
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,440
some similarities between me and Dick, but a lot of differences too, which is more of

66
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,440
a kind of Robert Anton Wilson way of approaching it, because he's such a pluralist, he recognizes

67
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:12,040
all these kind of different kind of things that are going on in any given situation.

68
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:18,720
And the experiences that P.K.D. had, were they with any specific kind of hallucinogenic

69
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,440
or it was across the board, he was just experimenting with different kind of drugs and had different

70
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,440
kind of experiences?

71
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:30,160
No, that's actually a good question, because in many ways, it happened sort of outside

72
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,520
of the direct context of drugs.

73
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:42,200
Now, in the 1960s, Philip Dick did try LSD and Mescaline, there's a handful of experiences,

74
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,560
and they were important to him, he referred to them, some of them were quite nightmarish,

75
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,040
and some of them definitely anticipated some of his 70s experiences and the imagery, you

76
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:58,360
know, he had a famous early trip where he ends up speaking Latin, and intoning these

77
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:05,600
terms from a Bach piece, and these sort of set up some of the Christian themes that come

78
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:12,280
up in his later religious experience, but he was mostly a speed user, starting in the

79
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:18,040
late 1950s, but really ramping up in the early 1960s, carrying through the whole decade,

80
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:23,760
like lots and lots of brain damaging amounts of speed, but by the early 1970s, he went

81
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:30,600
through a kind of almost a kind of death and rebirth thing, he bottomed out in Canada and

82
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:38,720
wound up in a rehab clinic, a really intense rehab clinic, and after that point, he kind

83
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,040
of turned his back on the counterculture, he didn't stop taking everything, I think

84
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,240
he still smoked weed sometimes, and you know, he may have had one or two psychedelic trips

85
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,840
that just kind of fell in there, but he kind of was out of that intense drug culture, it

86
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,320
had been for a number of years when these experiences happened, so you could say, well,

87
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,160
he was already brain damaged, but frankly, the thing about Dick is that if you go back

88
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:09,920
into his biography, his early biography particularly, he was always non-neurotypical, I mean, he

89
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:17,000
had a different reality, you know, he was wrestling with psychological symptoms, were

90
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,120
they psychotic, were they paranoid, were they schizophrenic, who knows, because all of those

91
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,560
things are moving targets, and he was diagnosed really early, he started to see shrinks when

92
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,320
he was very young, he started to take psychiatric drugs when he was very young, he took tons

93
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:39,360
of psychiatric drugs, so he was always a sort of mix of unpredictable psychological

94
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,520
symptoms and drugs, legal and illegal, and you know, whatever, so it's very hard to say

95
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,800
where drugs stopped and Philip K. Dick started, but at the same time, it's really important

96
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:59,840
to emphasize that unlike McKenna and Robert Anton Wilson, who are both very consciously

97
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,480
taking large doses of psychedelics in order to see how far out they could get, Dick was

98
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:10,120
not doing that, he was not experimenting that way, in fact, if anything, he was taking massive

99
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,920
doses of vitamin C because he thought that was going to do something, and maybe it did,

100
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:21,480
who knows, so he was kind of a druggy guy, but he wasn't like pedal to the metal on the

101
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,400
actual substance use at the time that he had these experiences.

102
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,760
You know, it's like what they're saying that the difference between insanity and genius

103
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,960
is so thin and blurry that sometimes people can't really tell the difference between the

104
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,960
two.

105
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:39,120
I mean, Dick is a better example of that than anyone, in my view, even his books, like his

106
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,880
greatest books, there's something a little fractured about them.

107
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,960
The writing isn't completely smooth all the way through, there's this sort of frenetic

108
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,560
energy and sometimes there's these jump cuts and you're like, where did that come from

109
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:57,500
or some rough elements in them, and so I kind of feel like one of the great things about

110
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,320
reading Dick is that you get to sort of enter into a mind that has an element in it that

111
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:08,320
is psychosis or that is sort of, you know, mentally unstable and yet he not only compensates

112
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,480
for it, but he kind of weaves it into his story, you know, on this sort of deeper level

113
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:19,360
and you're kind of with him as he's processing it personally and telling all these amazing

114
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,040
stories, and these stories just came from his head, like just, you know, he just could

115
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:31,120
spew them out, you know, he wrote most of his books, which are pretty intensely plotted,

116
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,360
there's multiple characters, the plots don't always quite hold up, but they're very dense

117
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,520
and woe-enriched, and he wrote most of his early books in one sitting, he just sat down

118
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,200
and like had a bunch of notes, some ideas, and he would just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,

119
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,960
sometimes in a week or two weeks, like a whole book, so he had an unusual capacity to tell

120
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:56,800
stories and to weave together networks of characters in a way that I think is really

121
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,560
singular and quite brilliant, and yet there's a way in which his brilliance is woven into

122
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,640
his psychosis, which some of his less good books, you can almost feel it, it's not just

123
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,640
that they're not very well written, it's that you're kind of in the presence of some

124
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,040
process that's unnerving to you and the author.

125
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,840
Different kind of context, I guess.

126
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,920
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

127
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,760
We are talking to Eric Davis, it's a pleasure to speaking with him, he has a new book called

128
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:32,560
High Weirdness, Drug, Soterica, and Visionary Experience in the 70s, and it's been published

129
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,800
by the MIT Press.

130
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,680
You mentioned that you want to talk more about, less about summary of your book because you've

131
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:46,680
been doing it for a while now, the book came out in June or July, and I found it really

132
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,620
interesting that you mentioned you would be interested to talk about how has your experience

133
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,920
has been talking about the book on different kind of setups, on different kind of podcasts.

134
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,760
Would you like to talk a little about that?

135
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,720
Yeah, yeah, sure.

136
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,960
It's actually been more illuminating than I thought it would be.

137
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,600
If you talk about a project you did, often time it gets a little like, oh yeah, I'm telling

138
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,560
the same story, and I didn't want to just keep telling the same story, so I started

139
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:17,760
to go into what was maybe a deeper interest on mine, what was it about the 1970s that

140
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,760
really interested me, and initially I would talk about, I was born in the 60s, so I kind

141
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,320
of, the 1970s is the first sort of cultural era that shaped me.

142
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,440
I remember things about the early 1970s when I was a little kid, and certain records my

143
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:39,540
parents had, and television commercials, and pop music, and stuff from that era, so it's

144
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:46,520
always really interested me, particularly the kind of dark spookiness, because it's

145
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:52,360
a very strange time in American history, and throughout the world in a lot of ways, but

146
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:58,960
definitely in American history, because it was kind of the first major bummer era of

147
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:07,680
America, which is sort of pathologically optimistic, at least until recent decades, and the 70s

148
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:14,080
was the first real like, wow, this is a bummer, and so I was really interested in that period,

149
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,920
but as I talked about the book, I realized that a lot of ways what interested me was

150
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:24,040
the similarities between that era and our era today, that if we look back in American

151
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:29,240
history and go, where is a time that we're going to find some of the same concerns, and

152
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:35,380
fears, and obsessions, and fantasies, and paranoias, and the same sort of psychic ambiance

153
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:40,480
that we have today, what's the closest to where we are, is definitely the 1970s, and

154
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:47,120
particularly the early 1970s, you know, strong degree of social polarization, there were

155
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,760
worries about the environment, and energy, and pollution, there was the terrorist became

156
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,000
a really significant figure with all of the hijackings, that was the kind of dominant

157
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,500
form of terrorism, as well as some of the bloodier gangs in America, and other places

158
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,000
where people were actually dying, and in some ways it was a lot more frightening, because

159
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,720
there was more, even more domestic terrorism than there is today, albeit from left, from

160
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,760
the left, rather than from the right, which is what we have today, and there was also

161
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:24,240
just kind of a cultural malaise, there was a sense of drifting, of being unsure, as well

162
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,720
as a degree of paranoia, some of our great films of paranoia are from the early 1970s,

163
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,200
like the parallax view, or the conversation, and anybody watching these films, even though

164
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,960
the technology is all analog, and it's not always about technology, it's about politics

165
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:45,080
too, anyone watching today would feel like a similar kind of like creeping suspicion,

166
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:50,840
that there's sort of dark shadow behind us, watching us, shaping us, that kind of sense

167
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:58,080
of paranoia that is partly related to conspiracy theory, the 70s was also a big period for

168
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,960
conspiracy theory, and indeed, that's what Robert Anton Wilson's, in some ways his most

169
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:09,400
famous book is about, in 1975, he published this book called Illuminatus, that had been

170
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:16,040
written over the previous five or six years, from the late 60s on, and it's this big satirical

171
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:24,880
romp, it's this funny, messy, goofy, pulp fiction, brilliant exegesis, just this mishmash

172
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:32,640
book, but the driving themes of it, are sort of the idea that all conspiracies are true,

173
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:39,000
and the main conspiracy is about the Illuminati, who again, feature heavily in today's conspiracy

174
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,920
stories, and he was sort of taking the piss out of it, but he was also kind of getting

175
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:49,640
into it, and indeed, the book has a weird quality, and I mean that term specifically,

176
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:54,160
that it kind of looks like a satire, he's just making fun of stuff, he's just having

177
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,960
fun as a writer, with his writing partner Robert Shea, they co-wrote the book, but you

178
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:04,960
can also kind of tell he started getting into it, and he's starting to recognize that there's

179
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:10,200
real similarities between, let's say, thinking about conspiracies, and thinking in terms

180
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:17,080
of the occult, or mysticism, and it's no accident that today, both conspiracy theory and occultism,

181
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:22,280
including astrology, and you know, psychic healing, and all this kind of stuff, is on

182
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:27,520
the rise again, because there's something about when you enter difficult political periods,

183
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,920
some of these stories become more salient, they become more powerful, and so, as I was

184
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,320
talking about high weirdness over the months, and I had all these great conversations, and

185
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,680
a lot of interest in podcast land, it's a very satisfying thing as a writer these days,

186
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,800
if you put out a book that's interesting, even if it doesn't sell that well, or doesn't

187
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,520
get any recognition from the mainstream, there's usually a whole world of people who are interested

188
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:55,520
in it, so you get to talk about it, and meet readers that way, and you know, it's a wonderful

189
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,160
thing about the podcast ecology, which to my mind is one of the most positive hopeful

190
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,360
things in our current kind of information environment, but anyway, as I was talking

191
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:11,420
about this stuff over the months, I became, I started to talk more and more about contemporary

192
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:15,560
politics in our contemporary situation, like it was less about, oh, let's go back to the

193
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:21,000
70s and enjoy all these specific details, I mean, that's all in the book, and anybody

194
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,400
who's interested in that period would get a lot out of just the general discussion of

195
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:34,920
that era, but my own shift is to sort of recognize how relevant these things are today, and I'll

196
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:41,160
give you one example that was really a nice confirmation.

197
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:49,520
The current issue of New York Magazine, and if you're listeners, it's worth it to open

198
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,520
up the image.

199
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,520
I'm showing it to them right now.

200
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,520
Oh, great.

201
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,520
Yeah.

202
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,720
The weirdness is coming, so one, they use the term, and we haven't talked about the

203
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,040
term weirdness now, but let's do it next, but I'll bookmark it for now.

204
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,320
The weirdness is coming.

205
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:11,880
It's about the next 10 years, and it's prediction, like kind of futurism, but not in sort of

206
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,400
that usual kind of technocratic way of saying, oh, in the future, we'll have these kinds

207
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,000
of new technologies and new problems as well.

208
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,040
Instead, it's like, whoa, things are about to get really weird, guys, like you're going

209
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:30,640
to be afraid of the wind, and malls are going to become massive interactive theme parks,

210
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,440
weird, or actually, we're not really science fiction people.

211
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,600
We're increasingly becoming medieval peasants who don't own anything, and we're like these

212
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,800
digital serfs, and so it's a little more fantastic.

213
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,960
It talks about how science fiction is going to be hard to write because we're going to

214
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,600
be living it, but even more than the fact that they're using weirdness to talk about

215
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:59,760
the future and the kind of weirdness of the future, not just its scariness or its problems,

216
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,440
but that quality of the weird, which is sort of unnerving, it's kind of mystical, it's

217
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,680
not really rational, it's poetic, it has a certain feeling, but it's also kind of disturbing.

218
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:15,280
You don't want to live there, and in a way, that's increasingly our general condition,

219
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,920
but it's the cover, the cover art that they chose, which is why I asked you to, it's great

220
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,600
you're showing it, is deeply 70s.

221
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:31,320
I can go to my bookshelves and pull out a dozen paperback titles with pictures just

222
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:37,280
like that, including Carlos Castaneda books, so kind of the epitome of psychedelic shamanic

223
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,760
weirdness in the 1970s.

224
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:45,080
They have covers that are just this kind of style, and so for me, that cover was a strong

225
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:52,300
confirmation that this sense of the 70s and the sense of weirdness was very applicable

226
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:58,080
and resonant with our contemporary moment in a very literal kind of way.

227
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,260
Now the connection just that came to my mind, I'm doing a Monday to Thursday livestream

228
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:09,800
called Beyond Good and Evil, and the main theme of that is how we have moved from centralized

229
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:14,320
structures of authorities, or we're moving from them, towards a decentralized kind of

230
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:22,080
a world that has been possible by internet and smart devices, and the similar thing between

231
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,880
what you were saying about the 70s, and right now it seems to me to be to breaking the monopoly

232
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,320
on distribution of information and interpretation of information.

233
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,700
It's really interesting because America had gone through the first psychedelic revolution

234
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:42,600
in the late 60s, right, and the 70s was kind of getting stuff back together to create some

235
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,680
kind of an order, and exactly because of that kind of an uncertainty, a lot of awesome things

236
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,760
happened and a lot of horrible things happened.

237
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,240
Yeah, no, I think you're really right on there.

238
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,200
I would characterize what happened in the 70s a little bit differently, and I talk about

239
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:06,240
that specifically in the first chapter of the book where I kind of lay out the 70s,

240
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,680
and one of the main things that happens is precisely what you're talking about, which

241
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,640
is a shift towards pluralism.

242
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:21,280
It's not the 1960s, it's in the early 70s, when not just avant-garde groups of counter

243
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:27,800
cultural people, but the society as a whole step towards a multi-centered, multicultural

244
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
world.

245
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,680
I mean, in our views today, maybe not multicultural enough, but for that time, quite radically,

246
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,400
where institutions started to acknowledge different identity positions, different sexual

247
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:45,520
orientations, different genders, the black power movement had opened up a space where

248
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:52,120
now Native Americans started grabbing a slice of the pie, Chicano started grabbing a slice

249
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:58,800
of the pie, so suddenly we're in a world where there's more different kinds of ways to be,

250
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:04,880
and I use a phrase, I call it the centrifugal self, and it's the idea that the self used

251
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,560
to kind of orbit around a central source of authority, and that that authority broke down

252
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:15,880
at least for everybody who wasn't in the silent majority or the conservative or the Bible

253
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:22,080
belt side of America in the 1970s, so that authority breaks down and then suddenly, whoa,

254
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:28,920
you're in this immense centrifuge moving in different directions, drifting, sampling,

255
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,720
trying things out for size, and the place you really see that, at least that I know

256
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:38,640
really well, in addition to the kind of multicultural society, is that inside the kind of culture

257
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,320
of seeking, spiritual seeking, religious, what's going to replace religion, what are

258
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,720
we going to do next, hedonism, we've been partying for years, and it doesn't get us

259
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,880
far, you know, we're stuck, we need something else, what are we going to turn to, and you

260
00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:03,400
find this enormous explosion of spiritual paths, gurus, sects, practices, you know,

261
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:12,520
as psychological seminars, as Rajneesh, meditation, blah, blah, blah, so suddenly, like all the

262
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:20,000
countercultural people, the ones who are seeking, it's this smorgasbord, you know, it's a multiplicity,

263
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,520
and you're right, at the same time, there are new forms of control that are entering

264
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:29,440
into the picture, you know, it's when we first start really using computer databases to track

265
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:36,360
consumers, it's when we, when the society shifts to a consumer debt economy, remember,

266
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:43,480
you know, Nixon takes us off the gold standard, so in a way, the economy is like set loose,

267
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,280
it's like, oh God, where's this thing going? Well, we can use computers to kind of not

268
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:54,240
only track people, but also help produce a sort of consumer debt culture where people

269
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,260
are kind of buying their way through different lifestyle options, oh, you want to be kind

270
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:03,800
of a swinger type, here we go, oh, you're into astrology, here you go, oh, you're a

271
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:09,160
Chicano, hey, we got stuff for you too, you know, so it becomes, in a way, it lays the

272
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:14,160
groundwork of our contemporary society, like if I look back, it's like, obviously, our

273
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:20,700
contemporary society is, you know, the origins of it are layered throughout, you know, millennia,

274
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:28,280
but the technological organization of culture and consciousness that we're sort of, you

275
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:34,320
know, kind of driving us crazy today, to my mind, you really go back to the early 1970s,

276
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,080
the emergence of the internet, the growth of satellites, the growth of these consumer

277
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:44,080
technologies of early kind of surveillance devices, I mean, of course, we've had surveillance

278
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,200
farther back, but they get technologized in a certain way that really kind of lays the

279
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,300
groundwork, and even as all of the energies of the counterculture kind of go into this

280
00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:02,800
emerging world, you know, it's not like the counterculture is completely outside, maybe

281
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:09,120
that was true in 1965 or something, but, you know, it becomes part of Madison Avenue, it

282
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,920
becomes part of culture, culture and consciousness sort of loop around, so that today, you know,

283
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:23,320
you have something as crazy as like the titans of the most successful global corporations

284
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:29,960
on the planet are going out to Burning Man and gobbling weird drugs and celebrating this

285
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:35,660
Dionysian Bacchanalia that looks like the acid tests in digital overdrive.

286
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:41,040
So that is such a weird paradox if you think about the 1960s when computers were owned

287
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:46,040
by IBM and straight-laced guys in suits and the hippies are over here playing with, you

288
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:51,400
know, analog synthesizers and there's no connection between those worlds, there are very little,

289
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:57,380
and now they're like, you know, and we're like, geez, how do I define myself now?

290
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:04,600
So again, I think one of the appeal of studying the 70s is that there's a distance so we can

291
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:10,880
get some sense of distance, some sense of the overall map, and yet in that mirror, we

292
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:19,200
see ourselves and both the excitement and the creativity of that decentralized experience

293
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,720
you're describing and it's the fearsome sides of it, the scary sides of it, I mean, beyond

294
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,520
good and evil is an exultant place to be and it's a terrifying place to be, especially

295
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,840
when you think about it as a general condition that everybody else gets to discover as well.

296
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,920
Yeah, absolutely, because as you said, it's all about identity and how we are defining

297
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:45,680
ourselves and how interesting it is to compare removing of centralized orders with what happened

298
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,540
with economy when Nixon got rid of gold standard.

299
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,760
It's like the same thing has happened all around the world.

300
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,800
I'm originally from Iran and Iran is on fire right now and nobody knows what's going to

301
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,900
happen.

302
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,020
Nobody knows that they don't like the government, but nobody knows where they're going, nobody

303
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:06,000
knows what's going to be the case, but it is the very same thing happening in the United

304
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,840
States that we used to look from Iran to and like, oh, that's a stable place.

305
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,920
We want to go there and enjoy all the freedom and everything, but everything changed because

306
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:19,840
of the differences of identities and how people are, at least the way that I see it and the

307
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,600
way that people are able to express themselves without going through middlemen.

308
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:29,880
And I think it is exactly because of that that this is such an interesting time that

309
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,420
it seems like we were experiencing the second psychedelic revolution.

310
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:40,760
And I want to talk to you a little about the connection between religions and psychedelics

311
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:47,400
overall and whether or not we are going to witness the kind of coming and creation of

312
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:53,600
new religions and spiritual path and spiritual practices this time according to the kind

313
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,640
of society that we are experiencing.

314
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:00,120
John Allegro, for example, he had a book called The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross talking

315
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:05,120
about the study of nature and origins of Christianity within the fertility cults of the ancient

316
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,880
Near East.

317
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:16,200
Zeratostrians, they were munching on something called hauma that is coming from soma, that

318
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:21,940
it's a Vedic kind of a drink that apparently is responsible for creation of Hinduism.

319
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:28,700
How do you see this relationship and how do you see the creation of new ways to define

320
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:35,000
ourselves on a basis of religion and spirituality considering this new revival of psychedelic

321
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,640
experimentation and adventurism?

322
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,560
Yeah, that's a great question.

323
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:43,800
I think I won't talk about the relationship between psychedelics and the origins of religion.

324
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:50,580
That's a very speculative and controversial topic because there's a lot of sort of suggestions

325
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:55,280
about things that could be and in some cases we know that there was something like the

326
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:02,720
soma or hauma or the drink that fueled the Eleusinian mysteries, but what was in it is

327
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,000
a controversial topic.

328
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:12,280
So let's just say that even beyond psychedelics, the origins of religion lie in altered states,

329
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:21,760
in trance states, in dreams, in psychedelics, in group ecstasies.

330
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,960
And then over time they develop in all these various different ways, but there's always

331
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:31,440
traces of those experiences in even conservative religions.

332
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,560
So let's say conservative Christianity, like fundamentalists, anti-drug, maybe get a little

333
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,160
bit of wine, but they're not, they're distrustful of that.

334
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:45,240
But still, even for those guys, you read the Bible and in the first part of the Book of

335
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:53,280
Acts, which is what happens after Christ gets out of the grave and takes the elevator up

336
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,400
to heaven.

337
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,320
So they're sitting around and they go, what are we going to do?

338
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,760
And then you have the Pentecost happen.

339
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,760
What happened?

340
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,760
Pentecost?

341
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,720
You read that and it's like, my God, that's like an acid test.

342
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,120
Suddenly they're all together and then everyone's babbling and speaking all the languages and

343
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,280
the fire comes down on their head and they're all like, I mean, Pentecost, there's a reason

344
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:16,760
that Pentecostals, which we were named for Pentecost, there's a reason that Pentecostals

345
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,160
all around the world are by far and away the most ecstatic of Christians.

346
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,240
They're the ones who are going in there, they're getting totally altered states.

347
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,040
I mean, the theology is incredibly conservative and probably some of them want to kill drug

348
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:34,960
users and kill queers and I mean, you know, the theology is very conservative, but the

349
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:40,560
practice is actually pretty wild and you know, you find different mixtures in different religions.

350
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:44,360
So there's always this problem of like, what do we do with trans states and what do they

351
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:50,080
have to do with religion in a way they feed religion, they allow religion to get going

352
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:55,340
and then once religion's going, it kind of needs, it sort of needs them to keep going,

353
00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:00,600
but then it also has to control them because they're freaky, they'll undermine your perspective,

354
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,760
they'll turn you into a mystic.

355
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:08,120
It's like, I don't need a priest, I talk to God, fuck you, I'm sorry, whatever, I'm

356
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,320
going to go off and do my own thing now.

357
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,840
So religions are always in this tension with altered states and how do you control them,

358
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,880
how do you give, how do you provide them, how do you resist them?

359
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,680
So what's going to happen now?

360
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,680
Very interesting.

361
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:27,040
I think that the, I mean, it's hard to say exactly what's going to go on with the psychedelic

362
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,040
Renaissance.

363
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:33,760
It seems pretty clear there's going to be relatively widespread access to psychedelic

364
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:39,640
medicine one way or another, particularly psilocybin, probably less so LSD.

365
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:45,360
At the same time, I think Ayahuasca is going to be more and more, even more and more accepted

366
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,080
and recognized as a valid path.

367
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,760
I mean, it's already the case that, you know, investment bankers from Wall Street or the

368
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:59,720
city in London are going to retreats and saying, oh yeah, Ayahuasca is another sort of golf

369
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,120
club in my bag for how to navigate the world.

370
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:09,720
So it's already reached a point of mainstream kind of awareness and I think that's just

371
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,920
going to increase.

372
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:18,280
So we are in this liberalization period of psychedelics.

373
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:22,640
How is that going to manifest in terms of religion or spirituality, which aren't quite

374
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,640
the same thing?

375
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:29,140
Let's say religions are more organized, larger, more traditional, more with more connections

376
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,760
to the past.

377
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:35,160
Spirituality can be all any number of things, although it also has its own, its own history.

378
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,880
Obviously spirituality is a big part of it.

379
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:44,160
Obviously people, you know, like if you look at, you know, around the world, people who

380
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:50,480
are interested in meditation, who are interested in yoga, who are interested in these indigenous

381
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,440
traditions, even if they're not indigenous, those people are often very interested in

382
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,840
psychedelics and indeed psychedelics helps fuel their speculations, their experiences.

383
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:05,400
You know, if you were into the tarot or astrology and then you take psychedelics and you kind

384
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:10,920
of trip out on astrology, it's going to get more, more astrological, not less, you know,

385
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,560
it's going to get more powerful, more enchanted, more poetic.

386
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,760
So it's a generalized fuel for spirituality.

387
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,060
But I think, but you asked about religion and I think that's the most interesting and

388
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,160
open-ended question.

389
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:30,960
What are we going to see in terms of liberal forms of Christianity, let's say?

390
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,960
Who knows?

391
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,600
I don't know, you know, there are little bits where you can see already things kind of gurgling

392
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,100
along the sides.

393
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:43,060
You know, there, I know that there is, there was one, you know, he sounded like a pretty

394
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:49,840
liberal Sufi guy, but there was one fatwa about ayahuasca that I can't remember the

395
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,000
sheikh's name right now, but he, you know, he laid it out there.

396
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,080
So there's, there's some world out there of like traditionalist Sufism that involves

397
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,080
ayahuasca.

398
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,580
So you're going to find these little zones, there's definitely Zen retreats that have

399
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:09,400
already been done and even studied where they take mushrooms as part of the Zen retreat.

400
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:14,040
And then they've studied whether the mushroom, whether the psilocybin actually aids some

401
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,960
of these other features of meditation and they seem to, they seem to allow people to

402
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,420
calm down quickly or get into deeper states, things like that.

403
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:27,880
So it's, it's pretty clear that, you know, and then ayahuasca depending on the situation

404
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,120
is more or less religion.

405
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:34,240
There are explicitly religious forms of ayahuasca like the Santo Daime and that's one of the

406
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,400
popular forms of it that people encounter in the West.

407
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,880
So I mean, it's hilarious.

408
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,000
You have like, you know, like out here where I live in the, in the Bay area, you have people

409
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:51,080
who like look and come from like totally just like hippie surfer, whatever, you know, totally

410
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,600
not religious at all.

411
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,240
Like what, and then they're, what are they doing?

412
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,120
They're putting on black pants and white shirts and black shoes and they're going and they're

413
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:03,200
dancing like this and they're singing songs about Mary and Jesus and stars and the jungle

414
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,760
to, you know, as they, when they go to Santo Daime groups, I mean, that's religion.

415
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:13,200
I mean, specifically like Santo Daime, you're all singing the same songs, they're religious

416
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,200
songs.

417
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,520
You're, you're, it's all about building community.

418
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:22,280
And I think that is the most interesting, whether we call it religion or not, how are

419
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:28,960
psychedelics going to help us really form new and vital forms of community?

420
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,400
Because the problem with the decent, one of the problems with the decentralized world

421
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:40,520
that you described, the beyond good and evil world is that when it happens in the context

422
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:48,880
of late capitalist consumerism with this incredible emphasis on the individual and on self-actualization,

423
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,520
self-improvement, self-realization, I need these things for me, for me.

424
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,320
It's about me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

425
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,100
And we can trace that back to the 1970s as well.

426
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:02,440
So when you have beyond good and evil and a culture of individualism, you get this problem

427
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,020
of isolation.

428
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:07,440
You get this problem of disconnection and that makes things worse.

429
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,400
That makes people more paranoid, makes them more angry, it makes it more volatile.

430
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,680
You know, it's a, it's a bummer, you know, and religion, you know, now we can look back

431
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,480
and go, well, religion, you know, it's not so great sometimes, but yeah, there's some

432
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,480
good things about religion and it's true.

433
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,620
There's some really good things about religion, the way it draws people together, it creates

434
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,720
a common sense of purpose.

435
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,480
If it's, if it's an ethical religion, it, even though there's some, you know, the ethics

436
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,440
are usually mixed, you know, don't, don't talk about the queers, but, but nonetheless,

437
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:44,320
there is a sort of ethical injunction that has a kind of progressive quality to it, even

438
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,040
if it manifests in, in mixed ways.

439
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,840
So I think our, part of our problem now is that it's pretty clear that individualism

440
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:56,480
is not going to, is not going to help us get through whatever we got to go through.

441
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,960
And when you see it in terms of psychedelics, if you notice, what is the mainstream view

442
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,200
of psychedelics?

443
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:10,320
What is the most widespread commercialized view of how people take psychedelics?

444
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:17,600
They go in as individuals into an office that is run by another set of individuals.

445
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:22,520
Maybe there's two people who sit with them and then as individuals, they go and lie down

446
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:27,060
on their bed, they put on their eyeshades, they take, they have their trip and maybe

447
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,640
their trip is ecstatic and maybe it's difficult, whatever.

448
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,500
And then that's the way you do psychedelics.

449
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,760
That's the mainstream view.

450
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,920
Does this remind you of anything?

451
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,680
It's totally individualized.

452
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,760
It's totally self-realization, self-healing, blah, blah, blah.

453
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,800
And I, I have no doubt that, I mean, this stuff is great.

454
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,720
That can be very useful for people, very helpful.

455
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,360
I'm not saying that that shouldn't happen, but the fact that that's our main imagination

456
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:58,880
for it, it tells us that we don't know how to do this kind of work collectively.

457
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,560
And so on the other side of the fence, then you have something like Burning Man, where

458
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:07,040
you had all these 10, 70,000 people go out there and a lot of them are on drugs and it's

459
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:14,480
this crazy exploratory, spontaneous, creative, inventive, ecstatic, Dionysian kind of thing,

460
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,480
which is awesome.

461
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,080
And it does help build community in certain ways.

462
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,680
The community of the campmates, you know, all the difficulty of doing that.

463
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:27,560
And so in a way, I think that the, the fact that on the one hand, we have the guy alone

464
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:32,680
taking the drug with the blind shades and the other extreme is Burning Man, which is

465
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,800
a kind of gesture towards a politics of community.

466
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,480
It's just, it's not, you know, it's, it's good in some ways and not so good in other

467
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,480
ways.

468
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,880
I think there are other things in between, maybe smaller scale, but ones where people

469
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,280
are much more woven into a kind of collective sense of being in the world.

470
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,440
And the one that interests me the most, which you can say, I don't know, religion is the

471
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:02,080
right word, is what I would call the kind of new animism.

472
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:06,640
And this is the sense that's rooted, you know, in profound spiritual experience and many

473
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:13,040
sacred texts and many poet poetic texts and in our, frankly, in our own childhood experience,

474
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,360
the sense that the world is alive, that the world, the objects in the world are alive.

475
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,600
And you could be a rationalist and go, well, they're not really alive.

476
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,960
And I'm like, okay, sure, fine.

477
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,800
But on some level they are because we're interacting with them.

478
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,800
They have their own things to say, you know, any, all the things in my office have histories

479
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,800
and stories.

480
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,600
They, certain conditions produce them just as certain conditions produce me.

481
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,560
And when I encounter them, it's an encounter.

482
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,320
It's not just me using them.

483
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,320
That's the rationalist view is we just as humans, we just use the world, but the world

484
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,200
is also, it's a world as part of a, it has its own world.

485
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,920
The things in the world have their own world and we're encountering them and psychedelics

486
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:58,120
really sort of inflame that kind of sense of relationality, that sense of, of the aliveness

487
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:02,360
of things and that there's a politics in that as well.

488
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:06,760
There's a way of recognizing how embedded we are in all these different systems that

489
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:13,640
are non-human and having to kind of recognize the, the alienness and the majesty and the

490
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:18,720
confusion of our situation beyond the human, you know, so you just talk about beyond good

491
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,720
and evil.

492
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,260
Well, let's talk about beyond the human.

493
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:25,600
What does it mean to really be alive and awake in a world where you recognize that you as

494
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:31,520
a human are always completely embedded in all of these non-human systems, technological

495
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:39,520
systems, media systems, control systems, but also air and wind and water and food and nutrients

496
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,520
and toxins and cosmic rays.

497
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:48,080
That's a very psychedelic vision, but it's also a very political vision and a very embedded

498
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,320
ecological vision.

499
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:57,880
And so I'm really interested to see forms of religiosity and spirituality that are involved

500
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,920
psychedelics that kind of move in that direction.

501
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,360
And then I have one more thing to say, which is that we are definitely going to see some

502
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,600
flipped out kooky cults coming down.

503
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,520
There's no way there's not going to be like, cause it's so easy.

504
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:17,080
You know, you're, if you're a psychologically unsophisticated person, meaning unref, self-reflective,

505
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,160
even if you're sophisticated about other people, but you're not reflective of yourself, it's

506
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:25,780
totally easy to believe your own BS and think that you've achieved some kind of realization.

507
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:30,040
You present yourself as a realized psychedelic being, all the people who are insecure are

508
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,280
like, oh, he knows, or she knows, let's surround him.

509
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,840
And then you take it and then you program people unintentionally, even you say like,

510
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:42,960
oh, we're all part of, can you see the cube, the cube that's formed between us?

511
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,640
And you're like, yes, I see the cube because psychedelics are so responsive to set and

512
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:52,360
setting to, to programming, essentially you, they're very sensitive to that kind of stuff.

513
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:58,960
So used consciously or unconsciously, it's very easy for people to get inflated and create

514
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,280
these kind of cult-like situations.

515
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,240
And we're totally going to see that stuff.

516
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,560
There's no way we're going to avoid that.

517
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:10,400
You know, I just hope it doesn't get so bad that it derails the good stuff that's, that's

518
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,200
coming down the pike, but it's going to get very interesting pretty fast.

519
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:19,840
Now, what you're saying resonates so much with me on, I just want to mention two points

520
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,840
of it.

521
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:25,400
Two weeks ago, I celebrated the 10th year anniversary of the first time I ingested psilocybin

522
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,160
mushroom in Vancouver, BC.

523
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,200
And it changed my life completely.

524
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:36,520
I went from being a complete militant atheist as a result of living for 23 years in Iran

525
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:43,480
to becoming, I don't know, and really embrace this not knowing and just curiosity to experience

526
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,840
rather than trying to understand.

527
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:51,920
And for years, I kept hearing about ayahuasca and we were talking about how it's a good

528
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,520
idea to go to Peru and do it.

529
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,480
And I ended up doing it for the first time in Florida, which is where I live now.

530
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,480
It's all over the place.

531
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,040
And what you were saying, the sense of community of it, that people sit overnight, at least

532
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,480
the way that I experience it, sit overnight around a fire.

533
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,000
The fire has its own philosophy, the smoke has its own philosophy.

534
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,600
It can get really religious, but at the same time, it is the sense of community that has

535
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,600
its negative, but it also has its positive.

536
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:24,000
And the other thing is, one of the most interesting topics to me is how we are going to merge

537
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,240
with our technology in a way that it's happening right now more and more, and how we are defining

538
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,120
what it means to be human.

539
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,160
So one of the questions that I keep asking from AI people and technologists that I invite

540
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:41,180
on this show is, would you say ethics and morality is objective or subjective?

541
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:46,520
If it's subjective, then how do we expect to create this new intelligence in a form

542
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:52,280
of artificial intelligence, if we haven't even figured out what our own values are as

543
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,280
a civilization?

544
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:58,920
Yeah, that's a really good question.

545
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:05,720
I'm with those that fear that particularly artificial intelligence in conjunction with

546
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:11,440
certain kinds of surveillance technologies, in conjunction with certain kinds of, let's

547
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,640
say, ultimately propagandistic meme control or whatever you want to call it, that that

548
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:22,360
is such a recipe for tyranny.

549
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:27,840
It's terrifying in its implications if you put your dark science fiction imagination

550
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:32,280
and you throw it in that direction, because there's certainly not anything inherently

551
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:40,120
ethical about increasing the capacity to control and to understand and to pattern and to connect

552
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:47,200
and predict, and all of the drivers of so much of contemporary society, they're not

553
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,720
really about ethical principles.

554
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:56,480
Do I think that a fully agential artificial intelligence would or would not have ethics?

555
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,520
That's a very interesting question.

556
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:04,980
I've spent a lot of time around Buddhism, and there are forms of Buddhism that really

557
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:14,440
try to use logic to undermine a lot of the conventional ideas that keep us locked into

558
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,920
certain egoic positions.

559
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:22,360
I sometimes fantasize, and I'm not the only one, about somehow programming an artificial

560
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:28,040
intelligence with the right logical principles that would inevitably lead to this kind of

561
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,880
bodhisattva compassion.

562
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:36,640
It's a fun science fiction story, but I think it does suggest that we do sense that there's

563
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:45,280
not going to be anything like inherent ethics that are coming out of these things just naturally.

564
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,080
It's like they have to be part woven into whatever it is that we're doing as we seek

565
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:54,360
out ethical answers, but ethics isn't looking so great out there on the global scale right

566
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,360
now.

567
00:44:55,360 --> 00:45:02,320
It's like, oops, and it's so hard because for me, it's funny because you're from Iran.

568
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:09,280
In my own life, I've hung out with a couple dozen people from Iran.

569
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,480
I always have a great time.

570
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,960
I would love to go to Iran.

571
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:19,620
I know that I would show up, and I would have a great time, but it's also like this place

572
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:24,800
of fantasy because it's probably not going to happen, at least anytime soon.

573
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:35,400
But there's this great example of this incredible richness of culture and sophistication and

574
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,400
open-endedness.

575
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:43,600
I don't know if secular isn't quite the right word, but let's say the free-thinking culture

576
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:48,800
in Tehran throughout the 20th century was remarkable, even in comparison to all these

577
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:55,760
places around it, and yet from an American mainstream perspective, what's next to China?

578
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:04,560
It's like this sort of the most corroded, horrible part of it's like, oh, it's so awful.

579
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:12,320
There's so many wonderful people that are locked into this situation that we can't see.

580
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:18,200
Because we can't see them, we can just project a story about crazy Iranians or whatever.

581
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:27,720
To me, even geopolitically, I'm pro-Iranian, anti-Iranian, maybe whatever, that's another

582
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,560
discussion.

583
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:34,000
But I always felt that we should have tried to have been better friends with Iran for

584
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
a lot of reasons.

585
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:42,520
But that stuff aside, for me, it's always an example of if only we could communicate

586
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:49,300
more on a level of people and that there was some kind of shared sense of value that would

587
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:54,520
enable us to get over the inevitable differences and recognize that it's we that are being

588
00:46:54,520 --> 00:47:04,760
oppressed by them on top, and instead of just projecting both ways, it's hard to describe.

589
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,360
No, I totally get it.

590
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:11,440
The problem with Iran, unfortunately, is that I always consider Iran to be an occupied country

591
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,760
by the Islamic regime because they're an absolute minority, absolute majority of people have

592
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,040
nothing to do with them, they're very westernized.

593
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,280
When I came to Canada, I had no culture shock.

594
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:25,900
My biggest culture shock, I keep telling people, it was how Western liberals criticized me

595
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:31,600
when I criticized political Islam that we all suffered under, the theocracy.

596
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,720
But it's just an unfortunate kind of a situation.

597
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,200
Eric's new book is called High Weirdness, Drugs, Esoterica, and Visionary Experience

598
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,400
in the 70s.

599
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,640
Eric, what kind of lessons have you learned or we haven't learned from the 70s that we

600
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,280
can use in this path that we're in at this time?

601
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,280
That's a really good question.

602
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,360
I mean, I think that in a way, some of the most inspiring stories of the 70s, which aren't

603
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:58,840
necessarily not exactly the ones that I'm talking about, because I'm really talking

604
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:03,640
about individuals who are like plunging into the depths of the mind.

605
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:12,840
But the part that I find most inspiring about the 70s is its sense of creative bricolage,

606
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,040
and I'll explain that term.

607
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,200
So it's a term from anthropology.

608
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:23,040
And what it means is sort of using what's at hand to cobble together something new.

609
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,160
So it's not like you can make something out of nothing.

610
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,520
It's not like you can engineer the perfect form.

611
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,880
You take a bit of this and a bit of that and a bit of this, and then collectively, you

612
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,800
kind of build something.

613
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,160
And this was a way like a lot of communes happened in the early 1970s.

614
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,440
You know, most of them didn't last that long.

615
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:44,600
But for the period of time that they were living, they were fascinating experiments

616
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:48,080
and they brought people together in new ways, with new ideas.

617
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:52,280
And they were like the same thing, like, let's take a little this, take a little that, put

618
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,280
it together.

619
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:59,360
And in a way, the three thinkers that I look at in the book, they're all bricolors of the

620
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,880
imagination or philosophical bricolors.

621
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:06,760
I call them garage philosophers, because they're like hacking it out in their garage.

622
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,080
They're tinkering away.

623
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,060
It's not like they're elites.

624
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:16,240
So there's something about that quality of tinkering, of hacking, of throwing together

625
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:24,840
this and that, of assembling that is a really strong thread in the 70s that feels appropriate

626
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:29,920
today in some way, although our tools are so different and how we think about the media

627
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,080
is so different.

628
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:37,560
But when I look ahead and I really, I can't believe that it's predominantly in the inside

629
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:42,160
the internet sphere, the communication sphere, the social media sphere, that we're really

630
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:48,120
going to find our way back to something or not even back, just find our way towards something

631
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,120
that gives us a better handle on things.

632
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:55,840
I just feel like it has to be in the real world, even as the real world is more difficult,

633
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:01,920
it's more crowded, it's uglier, it's more surveyed.

634
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:08,760
All of these not so groovy, more poisoned, more dying, but it's something about being

635
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:16,720
in the physical world with others in shared projects that seems to me a hopeful way to

636
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:17,720
go.

637
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,720
Excellent.

638
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:23,560
I can talk to you for hours, I know your time is precious.

639
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:27,920
So what's next for you and how our audience can follow your work?

640
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:28,920
Sure.

641
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:34,160
The way to follow me is I've had the same website since the mid 1990s.

642
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:39,320
It's called technosis.com, T-E-C-H-G-N-O-S-I-S.

643
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,800
It's the name of my first book and it's still in print.

644
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:49,000
So it's one people still like to turn to.

645
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,560
And so that's a great place to follow me.

646
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,360
You can sign up for my mailing list.

647
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,560
I only send one out like once a month.

648
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:59,480
And as for my next steps, I have a few writing projects that, you know, I'm not talking

649
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:05,360
about right now, but they're modest and I'm not really sure actually.

650
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,040
There's a number of different things that I'm thinking about.

651
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:14,380
I did a podcast for almost a decade and I needed a break.

652
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:19,560
So earlier this summer I went on hiatus and it continues to be a hiatus.

653
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:24,040
I know I'll return to podcasting in some form or another because I like it so much.

654
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:28,680
But it's actually a kind of a good time for me to sort of see what's going to come up

655
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,320
and not just dive right back in.

656
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:37,800
I think in our culture today, especially there's this kind of tension of like, you know, you

657
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,000
always got to be on it.

658
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,480
You got to be like producing, producing, producing, producing.

659
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:47,720
And if you don't stop and let it kind of break apart or like just kind of throw up a wall

660
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:53,280
temporarily, you're just going to follow like the kind of immediate path that you're laid

661
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,280
out for.

662
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,000
And that might take you somewhere interesting.

663
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,480
But if you can afford it, you know, temporarily, mentally, whatever, you can just go, okay,

664
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,480
wait a second.

665
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,480
What's okay.

666
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,480
I could go there.

667
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,480
I could go there.

668
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,480
Like what's happening?

669
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,480
What comes out of the bush?

670
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,280
What's what attracts you?

671
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,760
So I'm kind of doing doing that at this moment.

672
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:18,760
But there's definitely going to be podcasting, events, lectures, writings.

673
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:23,840
And you know, so so again, the technosis.com and getting on the mailing list is the best

674
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:24,840
way.

675
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,840
Fantastic.

676
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:29,240
Before I ask you the last question that I ask all my guests, is there anything else

677
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:32,640
you would like to add that we haven't got a chance to talk about?

678
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,320
No, that's good.

679
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,320
I'm also on Twitter.

680
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,040
I do Eric Davis to Twitter.

681
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,040
That's a fun one.

682
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,040
I like I like Twitter.

683
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:47,440
I don't I avoid arguing arguing on Twitter, I've got one or two trolls and I've disarmed

684
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,440
them both times.

685
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:53,320
I shouldn't say that because that's like a that's like a, you know, I'm not going to

686
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,040
let him disarm me, you know, whatever.

687
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,640
But I you know, I kind of I try to like maneuver through that whole thing.

688
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:04,800
And so for me, it's a much more friendly and exciting place.

689
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:09,200
So let me ask you the last question I ask all my guests that if you come across an intelligent

690
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:14,000
alien from a different civilization, what would you say as the worst thing humanity

691
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
has done?

692
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,840
And what would you say is our greatest achievement?

693
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:21,800
So not the way we are, but what we've done.

694
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,280
Yeah.

695
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,280
That's interesting.

696
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,280
That's the difference between us.

697
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:29,440
Funny that that popped in is like how that how you know, what's the worst thing about

698
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:34,560
human beings the way they are versus what they've done and the best thing?

699
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:54,640
That's a push we well, I think I think the the the despoiling of the thoughtless despoiling

700
00:53:54,640 --> 00:54:03,760
of our planetary environmental situation is the worst thing from a kind of cosmic perspective.

701
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,520
Like we've done more horrible things to other people.

702
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:13,400
I mean, you could say, you know, all the ways we've treated ourselves basically could be

703
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:16,040
just as just as bad.

704
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:24,320
But there's something more, even more thoughtless and insane about that, about the environment.

705
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:29,680
And then the best thing are, you know, art, art.

706
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,040
I mean, for sure.

707
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:38,600
I mean, what I sometimes think that, you know, if an intelligent alien came to our, you know,

708
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:43,200
our zone and was like, oh, what's what's of what's the value here?

709
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:48,720
They would mostly be disgusted, but they go, but you know, there's some good stuff there.

710
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:57,360
You know, we got a got Taj Mahal, you got, you know, J.S. Bach, you got Thomas Pynchon,

711
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,180
you know, there's some good stuff out there.

712
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:06,760
So I kind of almost feel like the human experiment, if it's going to be if it's going to be justified,

713
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:13,360
can only really be justified in in art in the full sense, like art as in a way of living

714
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:20,960
life, not just of creating objects and being the same, you know, grubby, competitive narcissist

715
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:26,960
that everybody else is, you know, it's not just the objects, but the art as a pathway.

716
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:31,960
But I still feel like both of these answers were a little not quite as as it's a tough

717
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:32,960
one.

718
00:55:32,960 --> 00:56:00,960
But I still feel like both of these answers were a little not quite as as it's a tough

719
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,960
one.
