WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
I would offer, actually, the World Wide Web is our greatest achievement.

00:06.080 --> 00:12.400
The technology that makes self-expression possible and collaboration, I think it's

00:13.440 --> 00:20.480
instigated a renaissance across the world. It's amazing. And in a sense, it's only getting started.

00:20.480 --> 00:29.600
So, ask me 10 years from now and I'll say the successor for the web, whatever that is.

00:35.200 --> 00:41.200
Hello, this is Agha Bahari and I am here with the first episode of Neo-Human.

00:42.240 --> 00:47.120
I will be talking to interesting people about interesting subjects. We don't have any specific

00:47.120 --> 00:53.040
subject or title or style for the podcast, whatever happens, it's just going to be interesting.

00:53.040 --> 00:58.400
That's the most important thing. For the first episode, right here with me,

00:58.400 --> 01:08.400
we have David McFadzen, who is a lead engineer at a Synaptic, which is a Toronto-based technology

01:08.400 --> 01:14.240
company. Synaptive. Synaptive. Horrible. I asked you the name before the show too.

01:14.240 --> 01:19.440
So, what do you do at Synaptive and what does Synaptive do?

01:21.200 --> 01:28.880
Yeah, Synaptive is a startup that's about almost four years old now and we build technology to

01:28.880 --> 01:34.480
mainly assist neurosurgeons in difficult brain surgeries. So, we have a line of products

01:35.280 --> 01:41.040
to look at the scans from the brain and render them in 3D and help the surgeon

01:41.040 --> 01:50.880
plan the surgery in advance. And then in the OR, our software acts sort of like a GPS for surgeons

01:50.880 --> 01:57.040
because it's like a Google Maps to show them where they are and help her along in their route.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.560
And if they get off course, they can get back on with the 3D map of the brain.

02:02.560 --> 02:09.440
And this is usable with robotics and with human doctors. Both can use it. Because I remember

02:09.440 --> 02:14.640
you were saying that you have a robotic arm at the work. That's right. I'm the lead software

02:14.640 --> 02:21.840
engineer on our robotic arm project. It's a device positioning system that's designed to assist the

02:21.840 --> 02:27.360
surgeon. So, it's holding the optics for the surgery, which is the lighting in the camera

02:28.240 --> 02:36.000
and a microscope. And it's recording video. And the robotic arm on MacLea positions the

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
optics of the camera into ideal positions for the surgeon. We just have to make a gesture that they

02:42.000 --> 02:48.240
want it in some particular place and press a foot pedal. And the robotic arm will move the

02:48.240 --> 02:52.560
optics into the correct position. That's amazing. How long did it take

02:54.800 --> 03:03.040
from the concept idea of such a thing to being at this level that you guys are, which

03:03.040 --> 03:07.280
I believe you're ready to be launched? It launched last February actually.

03:07.280 --> 03:12.960
It launched last February? Yeah. From concept to when it was FDA approved and actually used in

03:12.960 --> 03:18.400
our real surgery was less than two years. Oh, wow. That's amazing. And you still consider the whole

03:18.400 --> 03:23.120
company as a startup. Like you're not a corporation per se. We're in transition now.

03:23.920 --> 03:28.800
Since we got FDA approval last February and we're deployed now, we're out in the field at,

03:28.800 --> 03:33.760
I think, eight or nine different installations now, different hospitals around the United States.

03:35.040 --> 03:41.920
And it's to date in the last eight months or so since it's heard. It's been used in 500 real

03:41.920 --> 03:51.600
surgeries. That's amazing. What do you think is, I'm an enthusiast entrepreneur, I have to say.

03:52.240 --> 03:58.400
Like, I'm very interested in creative ideas and then implementing those ideas and with

03:58.400 --> 04:03.840
computers and coding, it's never really been easier, I think, to make an idea from ground up

04:03.840 --> 04:14.480
with a very limited number of people. That's very true. Yeah. What do you think the effect of such

04:14.480 --> 04:19.600
technologies in our, because the company that you're explaining is a very specific company

04:19.600 --> 04:26.080
that doing very specific thing? How do you think those technologies will translate into a popular

04:26.080 --> 04:35.280
or mainstream consumer to be able to take advantage of that? For example, let's say this is just off

04:35.280 --> 04:40.800
the top of my head. Would there be a possibility of mixing this technology or would you see the

04:40.800 --> 04:49.680
possibility of mixing this technology with a very straightforward variable like the EEG

04:49.680 --> 04:57.360
variables that exist right now that assist you to meditate? I think they're also a company from

04:57.920 --> 05:06.240
Toronto, Emuse or Muse, I think. Right. I think we actually used Muse at a hackathon that we

05:06.240 --> 05:12.320
did internally at Synaptive a couple of months ago. And using Lemuse will detect brainwaves of

05:12.320 --> 05:17.840
some sort and encode them in a way that software can take advantage of. So one of the demos was

05:17.840 --> 05:25.040
to move the robotic arm just by thinking about it. Wow. It was amazing. I bet, yeah. Yeah,

05:25.040 --> 05:30.160
so we're definitely looking at new consumer electronics to bring that into the OR to help

05:30.160 --> 05:37.120
the surgeon. Stuff like the Oculus Rift or the Microsoft HoloLens to give the surgeon a heads

05:37.120 --> 05:42.800
up display and show them the 3D rendering of the brain as if he was living in that space.

05:42.800 --> 05:49.680
That's amazing. You would imagine this also beside the surgery itself for training. This is a

05:49.680 --> 05:57.680
very great achievement. The way that you don't necessarily have to experiment on even like

05:57.680 --> 06:03.840
animals for a lot of stuff that are going on inside. When we want to test their brain pulses

06:03.840 --> 06:09.680
or anything instead of doing it on the animal, it will be able to done in a virtual space in

06:09.680 --> 06:14.720
the virtual brain. Yeah, definitely. You could see this in the Microsoft proportional material

06:14.720 --> 06:19.440
for the HoloLens. Some of the early demos are in the classroom where a teacher is showing

06:19.440 --> 06:25.680
the kids a solar system or whatever and the kids have HoloLenses and the solar system is

06:25.680 --> 06:31.040
right there in the classroom with them and animated and interactive. Or games. Yeah. Yeah,

06:31.040 --> 06:38.400
it's just unbelievable. Another use that this kind of technology has had in the past couple

06:38.400 --> 06:43.680
years has been a military and they've done it for good and for evil and per se.

06:45.840 --> 06:53.280
Even though it might be necessary evil. But the technology has been used to treat PTSD very

06:53.280 --> 07:02.080
seriously and they've had very successful results from it. Where do you see the future

07:02.080 --> 07:09.920
of that technology with that assistance are going? And how does technology as a whole will play

07:11.120 --> 07:16.240
a bigger and bigger role in the army and in military industry complex?

07:18.160 --> 07:23.520
We see with the rise of drones that has been, I dare say, almost a decade now.

07:26.320 --> 07:31.280
Where do you see this whole thing is going? Because we are not going to stop fighting.

07:31.280 --> 07:38.880
The war is going to continue. And I think the difference would be that we will have less

07:38.880 --> 07:44.320
casualty because technology is covering most of the ground that people had to do before.

07:44.960 --> 07:50.160
Where do you see this whole thing going with the usage of technology and its dependence to

07:50.160 --> 07:57.520
advance technology? Well, in military particularly, I think the trend is to push more and more

07:57.520 --> 08:04.000
computational power down to the ranks and replacing humans with automation. Obviously,

08:04.000 --> 08:10.560
it's much safer for their side. But they're going to run into a pretty significant ethical

08:10.560 --> 08:17.600
decision probably really soon about giving autonomous drones the power to kill or the right to kill.

08:19.760 --> 08:24.000
Would you think that they will announce that they're about to do that or they'll just do it

08:24.000 --> 08:30.960
until they get caught? Judging from recent events, I think probably the latter.

08:32.160 --> 08:36.080
It will find out about it on WikiLeaks. Yeah, I think so.

08:38.720 --> 08:44.160
It's been amazing. I think it's a great achievement of technology that you can

08:44.160 --> 08:56.400
go in a small room in Arizona and control a drone in Afghanistan and drop a bomb because

08:58.800 --> 09:03.520
of course, it's not resulting always in good. Sometimes it does and there are some people

09:03.520 --> 09:08.960
that need to be killed and that's the only way. And I much rather a drone will kill them than a

09:08.960 --> 09:18.000
soldier on our side basically being put in risk to deal with a Taliban leader or whoever.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.560
But at the same time, you see how people are treating, for example, even driverless cars.

09:22.560 --> 09:27.520
There are already a lot of people freaked out about it. People are freaked out about drones

09:27.520 --> 09:33.280
use of mainstream drones. You see these conspiracy theorists that have

09:33.280 --> 09:42.160
YouTube channels and iTunes podcasts and all of that. They're talking about, shoot the drones

09:42.160 --> 09:48.400
down with your shotguns and all the people who are very concerned about these kind of thing

09:48.400 --> 09:58.720
conspiracies. How do you think the challenge that technologists and technology enthusiasts have

09:58.720 --> 10:04.560
who are between two sides, one being the politics and politicians and the other being

10:05.760 --> 10:11.120
people who are basically always scared of a new thing. That new thing has to be proven

10:11.120 --> 10:16.480
many, many times and more and more people using it for masses to accept the usage of that. How

10:16.480 --> 10:23.840
do you think it will result in? Will it slow the advancement down or slow it down or speed it up?

10:23.840 --> 10:30.880
I think the way it will actually play out is we'll see some significant pushback initially

10:32.240 --> 10:39.840
because it is a big change, but it's also fairly inevitable that this is going to happen.

10:39.840 --> 10:44.800
It reminds me of David Brin's Transparent Society when surveillance becomes pervasive

10:45.360 --> 10:51.200
and that could have actually net positive effects on society, as we've already seen with

10:51.200 --> 10:58.560
the way the police in the US have reacted to their cameras. All of a sudden,

10:59.760 --> 11:04.960
police are getting caught all the time and I think it's changing the way they behave. They're

11:04.960 --> 11:11.120
becoming more ethical in their professional behavior now. Yeah, it's like a double-edged sword

11:11.120 --> 11:18.080
because it's become more transparent for the authorities to control that, but at the same time

11:18.080 --> 11:24.960
a general population also are seeing it more, so they do believe that it's happening more.

11:26.800 --> 11:31.040
But once it reaches some critical threshold, I think it will just become accepted,

11:31.040 --> 11:35.520
like cell phones have become accepted. There was pushback initially about those two,

11:36.720 --> 11:40.160
that people were just walking down the street talking to themselves that looked weird,

11:41.520 --> 11:46.160
but now it's so calm, nobody looks twice. It's just accepted.

11:46.160 --> 11:51.760
Also, virtual reality, I think, will have a lot to do with that because people would have

11:52.640 --> 12:00.000
the possibility to be whoever they want physically. On the game, Second Life,

12:00.000 --> 12:07.600
that you can create your own avatar and live in that. People get married, people buy stuff.

12:08.400 --> 12:13.040
Sweden, I heard, has an embassy in that virtual world. Nike has a store.

12:13.040 --> 12:21.680
I think it will begin with, this is weird that people are doing because people will do that

12:21.680 --> 12:26.960
and film it and put it on YouTube to create a community and find like-minded people. It's

12:26.960 --> 12:33.680
amazing that we can do that all around the world now. At the same time, you freak certain people

12:33.680 --> 12:45.600
out, the people who watch Fox News and all those propaganda, basically. Those people are not that

12:45.600 --> 12:52.640
much of a concern, I agree, but we hear also from someone like Elon Musk and Bill Gates and Steve

12:52.640 --> 13:01.600
Wozniak or... I don't want to say scaring people, they're smarter than that. They're making a very

13:01.600 --> 13:10.640
valid case of dangers of artificial intelligence. But at the same time, I think these kind of

13:12.960 --> 13:19.920
warnings, even though necessary, it will lower the budget that research facilities can have to

13:19.920 --> 13:26.400
actually work on it because if public opinion is not behind an idea, it would be very hard to

13:26.400 --> 13:31.760
finance it. It's like, I have a very good idea for a startup, but I'm probably not going to have

13:31.760 --> 13:38.160
more than 10 users. Nobody's going to fund me. Right. Yeah, we saw the same thing happen with

13:38.160 --> 13:43.120
prediction markets a few years ago. Robin Hansen was ready to roll out a prediction market that

13:43.120 --> 13:47.680
would help with public policy. And one of the questions that they were interested in betting

13:47.680 --> 13:55.520
on was the chance of a terrorist event. But some senators got ahold of this information and ran

13:55.520 --> 14:00.400
a scare campaign saying it would be terrible to bet on these sorts of things because one side has

14:00.400 --> 14:07.600
to bet on it happening, which could be seen as promoting it in some sense. There was a silly

14:07.600 --> 14:13.840
reason anyways, but the point is that it turned public opinion and the project was abandoned.

14:14.400 --> 14:18.720
Do you blame that senator or you blame the people who voted that senator into Senate?

14:18.720 --> 14:26.960
I think they're all to blame. Yeah, because senators, one senator has to be thousands of

14:26.960 --> 14:33.680
people at least behind him. And I think that's one of the greatest revelations in the United

14:33.680 --> 14:39.040
States. Donald Trump running for presidency because you see everybody who's behind him.

14:39.040 --> 14:45.360
It's a very interesting phenomenon. Yeah. Yeah. Only only one person predicted that.

14:45.360 --> 14:51.280
Who was that? God Adams, the creator of Dilbert. Really? Seriously. He said Donald Trump will run

14:51.280 --> 14:58.960
for president? He said that Donald Trump will continue to lead in the Republican polls long

14:58.960 --> 15:03.280
before anyone else even considered that possibility. Everyone else thought he was a

15:03.280 --> 15:08.400
joke and that he was popular initially because it was funny. But that's actually not the case.

15:08.400 --> 15:14.880
No. What's very interesting is that they were reading the polls,

15:17.920 --> 15:24.720
not polls really, but how much time media is covering Donald Trump in comparison to

15:24.720 --> 15:29.840
the other people. It's twice as much as Hillary Clinton, the time that Trump is getting. And

15:29.840 --> 15:36.320
I think 13 times more than Bernie Sanders. What Trump understands is how to manipulate

15:36.320 --> 15:41.840
media to his advantage. Absolutely. And he knows that whoever has name recognition is going to be

15:41.840 --> 15:48.160
highest in the polls. It's such a great transition though because with reality shows become more

15:48.160 --> 15:53.040
popular in the United States and the celebrity culture. I had this conversation with somebody

15:53.040 --> 16:00.400
else that I was like celebrities became the idols. The greatest thing that you can be in the 21st

16:00.400 --> 16:07.040
century. And she was saying that no, people were celebrities before that. But I was like, no, not

16:07.040 --> 16:13.680
like this that you use, for example, Bono from YouTube for any humanitarian campaign that you

16:13.680 --> 16:19.600
have to get attention from people. It's not the cause that is getting the attention of the people.

16:19.600 --> 16:27.280
It's a celebrity. And then by the rise of that, and now you see a person who's a creator of a

16:27.280 --> 16:36.640
reality show. And it's an apprentice, misuniverse, all those things. Nobody knows better than him

16:36.640 --> 16:44.320
how to manipulate the media, as he said. And I mean, it's appealing to most people, I think,

16:44.320 --> 16:50.000
because he's not getting any money from big corporations and CPACs and nobody.

16:50.000 --> 16:57.760
Right. He's posing as the outsider. He is above corruption. And the thing that I think people

16:57.760 --> 17:05.440
most find appealing is he speaks his mind. He doesn't care what people think about what he says.

17:05.440 --> 17:11.440
I mean, he goes to extremes to make that point. Do you think he believe a lot of?

17:11.440 --> 17:14.720
No, I think he does that in order to get media attention.

17:14.720 --> 17:21.120
I think so, too. I think so, too. I'm at this point, as we had this conversation

17:22.320 --> 17:30.720
before, I'm a Bernie Sanders supporter. And I think it would be very good for America to have

17:30.720 --> 17:36.960
a change in that direction. It's a very extreme change. We were a capitalist, but now we are

17:36.960 --> 17:45.360
being run by a Jew, liberal, a socialist. It would be a very good change, in my opinion. But

17:45.360 --> 17:51.680
if he drops out, I'm supporting Donald Trump, because I think he does not believe a lot of

17:51.680 --> 18:01.200
stuff that he says. You cannot possibly be that blind and make it that far. I think in a city

18:01.200 --> 18:09.680
like New York City. And Hillary Clinton, I have no interest in her. No, I think Hillary would just

18:09.680 --> 18:15.600
be a continuation of Obama, which turned out to be just a continuation of W. Bush. Surprisingly.

18:15.600 --> 18:21.440
I agree. Against all odds. Everyone's wishes. Is it really a surprise? Because one man in a

18:21.440 --> 18:27.760
democracy doesn't supposed to be able to change anything. You have to go. So it's a democratic

18:27.760 --> 18:36.480
system that is backstabbing itself, in my opinion, because the parties' rhetorics against each other.

18:37.600 --> 18:45.440
And one person who's being elected as somebody who you can use as a punching box,

18:46.720 --> 18:51.680
you know, punching bag. I don't think he can do much.

18:51.680 --> 18:57.680
Well, perhaps not. But you'd expect him to push in the directions of his promises when he's actually

18:57.680 --> 19:02.080
gone in the other direction. I think the good things that he did, I'm not really sure about

19:02.080 --> 19:06.720
healthcare system, because apparently it's one of those things you have to live in the U.S. to

19:06.720 --> 19:12.640
experience. I heard good things and bad things about Obamacare from different people who I respect

19:12.640 --> 19:22.320
their opinions. I think when he made it legal for the same-sex marriages to become federal,

19:22.320 --> 19:30.160
I think that was a good thing. And I still think he will do more in this last year. I'm not an

19:30.160 --> 19:38.320
Obama fan at all. In the first term, when he was running, I was totally supporting John McCain.

19:38.320 --> 19:46.880
And then John McCain elected Sarah Palin as vice president. Why would you do that? It's such a

19:46.880 --> 19:53.200
weird thing. That was bizarre. Yeah, they made a really cool movie about it. Woody Harrelson,

19:53.200 --> 20:01.600
isn't it? I can't remember the name. But it's about that era of Sarah Palin. It's based on a book

20:01.600 --> 20:11.520
whose Sarah Palin's advisor after the campaign was over, he wrote, and it was a disaster with her.

20:13.040 --> 20:18.560
But again, she's one person. There are thousands of people who are supporting her. She's still

20:18.560 --> 20:25.200
apparently making the most money in the conservative charities and conservative fundraisers.

20:25.200 --> 20:32.560
Who knows? It's really strange. You think the new government of Canada will have any effect in

20:34.960 --> 20:44.720
the social life of Americans in a way that this is a liberal government. We pulled out of Syria

20:44.720 --> 20:51.600
in the first week that he became a prime minister. And then we started getting refugees,

20:51.600 --> 20:57.760
even though the numbers are not comparable with what Europe is doing. And that we can talk about.

20:59.200 --> 21:04.400
I fully expect the Trudeau's government to be kind of an example for Americans to show what's

21:04.400 --> 21:14.240
possible. Yeah. Other than the ridiculous choices they have now. I mean, it's sad. I don't know.

21:14.240 --> 21:18.480
Me and my girlfriend, we have this conversation. She's a big supporter of Hillary Clinton,

21:18.480 --> 21:23.040
because she also has worked for Hillary Clinton. And she was very impressed with her as a boss.

21:23.040 --> 21:30.880
She's a smart person. She brought technology in a very involved way into state department.

21:31.840 --> 21:37.360
And she's a defender of women rights. But then you watch a lot of different stuff that's been

21:37.360 --> 21:44.800
put together, how she has flip flopped from time to time. And then you wonder, you know,

21:44.800 --> 21:51.920
is this really the best that United States of America can offer as a candidate for presidency?

21:51.920 --> 21:56.000
Like there's nobody else. My favorite candidate would be Eric Schmidt of Google.

21:57.280 --> 22:05.920
Yeah, because they are obviously smarter than anybody who's running, you know, for president

22:05.920 --> 22:12.480
politicians. But unfortunately, we are kind of taken hostage by lawyers, it seems like.

22:12.480 --> 22:17.280
Neil deGrasse Tyson was also saying that you look at the Congress and Senate,

22:17.280 --> 22:22.000
the lawyer, lawyer, businessman, lawyer, lawyer, businessman. Where are the scientists? Where

22:22.000 --> 22:29.120
are the engineers? They're in Europe. I mean, the Europeans don't have the same problem with

22:29.120 --> 22:35.680
their politicians. They actually have academics and politics. Which they should. They should.

22:35.680 --> 22:42.080
You'd expect that. Yeah. But no, it's, it's, I mean, a lot of good news is coming from

22:44.320 --> 22:50.560
the West in the sense that countries with innovation, you know, the first world countries.

22:51.760 --> 22:56.880
But at the same time, you see a lot of nonsense is also coming out of them.

22:56.880 --> 23:04.080
Look at Europe, the problem that they have now with the refugee crisis.

23:06.000 --> 23:10.480
And what happened in Germany, which I'm sure you know about in the New Year's Eve,

23:11.440 --> 23:17.360
it just kind of makes it worse. And already, I think people are completely ignoring them.

23:18.480 --> 23:24.480
They're the radical right who are, they're rising very powerful in decades.

23:24.480 --> 23:33.920
You can say in Germany, in Greece, in France, in Finland, in Sweden, you see people who were

23:33.920 --> 23:39.760
national socialists and they, they couldn't even breathe really in a political spectrum in those

23:39.760 --> 23:45.520
countries. They're, they have a lot of supporters now and the extreme right group in Germany,

23:45.520 --> 23:55.760
in Germany, Pegida, they had a, they had a rally here in Ottawa and there are videos on

23:55.760 --> 24:00.240
YouTube that they were on the streets and there are also people who are countering them,

24:00.240 --> 24:06.480
who are anti-racism and all of that. Where do you, where do you see this whole social conflict

24:06.480 --> 24:15.840
is going? Well, from what I understand, the attacks in Cologne New Year's Eve were actually suppressed,

24:15.840 --> 24:19.200
news of the attacks were suppressed by the government because they're afraid it would

24:19.840 --> 24:25.440
fuel kind of anti-immigration sentiment on the right. And then the mayor, as soon as the news

24:25.440 --> 24:31.200
came out, it made it much worse because now the socialist governments are protecting the bad actors.

24:31.200 --> 24:38.400
That's right. That's not the side you want to be on. No. And the mayor of Cologne, the mayor

24:38.400 --> 24:44.640
basically blamed the women. The women, great. Yeah. It's like, keep, keep the man at the arm

24:44.640 --> 24:50.480
length. I'm like, what are you talking about? Like, do you flip this easily? Like, what did it take?

24:51.040 --> 24:58.160
And my understanding is that they're getting 1 million, 1 million plus refugees into Germany.

24:58.160 --> 25:03.360
This is not going to go away, this problem, because then they're going to push for them to

25:03.360 --> 25:08.880
become citizen faster so they can vote for that party. Right. That's my thinking. And I have the

25:08.880 --> 25:13.920
same thinking about abortion and people who are against it, that they don't care about that baby.

25:13.920 --> 25:18.800
They just care about one more Christian and one more Muslim or one more whatever. It's a number.

25:18.800 --> 25:27.120
Mm-hmm. And the fact that they're committing suicide, I think, in Europe for the sake of

25:27.120 --> 25:35.360
their own political game and agenda. Yeah, it looks ironic from outside observer.

25:35.360 --> 25:44.560
Yeah, for sure. And as you're saying, Europeans, they master a lot of things much faster than

25:44.560 --> 25:52.400
Americans. They already, as you said, have academics and scientists and their political system

25:53.200 --> 25:59.360
completely involved. But they, at the same time, you see the openness in the European way and

25:59.360 --> 26:05.520
multiculturalism in the European way that they promoted, for example, in England is causing

26:05.520 --> 26:16.000
a lot of problem right now. See all those Muslim British or British Muslims who joined the terrorist

26:16.000 --> 26:21.280
group ISIL in the Middle East. A lot of them are British, the guy who-

26:21.280 --> 26:23.760
They were born and raised in Brittany.

26:23.760 --> 26:29.360
Yeah, like they went to school, sometimes in BBC, they're talking to people who knew them

26:29.360 --> 26:37.200
when they were a kid. The guy, Jihadi John, who just got assassinated like two weeks ago,

26:37.200 --> 26:42.640
he was replaced by another British guy. And they right away found out who he was.

26:44.080 --> 26:55.520
And he was one of the people who are very closely related to, excuse me, to the Islamic extremist

26:55.520 --> 27:00.720
Anjum Chowdhury. I don't know if you know him, he's like a preacher for extreme Islam in London

27:01.600 --> 27:05.600
and completely protected by the government. He's getting paid by the government.

27:07.520 --> 27:13.680
But that guy who I had seen before in the documentaries about them, now he joined

27:14.640 --> 27:20.080
ISIL and he became a new Jihadi John. He just released a video. It's like very surreal.

27:20.080 --> 27:26.880
It is. I think it's really interesting to see the recent backlash against these progressive

27:26.880 --> 27:33.120
values, the ones that are protecting the terrorists. In fact, there's a new term for them, the regressive

27:33.120 --> 27:39.040
left. They're the ones that are attacking Sam Harris and his colleagues for actually addressing

27:39.040 --> 27:46.800
the problem. So Glenn Greenwald and Ben Affleck, of course, on the Bill Marshall calling Sam a

27:46.800 --> 27:56.240
racist for saying that this is actually an issue. Yeah. I hope that we come to rationality and

27:57.680 --> 28:03.600
smart thinking in a way that we don't really have to get our facts from Ben Affleck, for example.

28:05.040 --> 28:11.760
Because the other side of his story, who at that occasion was Sam Harris, he's more than qualified

28:11.760 --> 28:19.600
to talk about any of those things. He has studied it. He's a philosopher and a neuroscientist

28:20.560 --> 28:27.040
and he's been writing and talking about these issues for a while, for a long time.

28:27.760 --> 28:29.120
Since he published the end of faith.

28:29.840 --> 28:36.880
Absolutely. And I think 9-11 was a horrible thing, but in a way, a lot of good came out of it in a

28:36.880 --> 28:45.600
sense that people like Sam Harris, people like Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, Douglas

28:45.600 --> 28:53.040
Morey, this people started targeting what the problem really they think is. And I agree with

28:53.040 --> 28:58.560
them completely. Do you think there would have been no God Delusion published, if not for 9-11?

28:59.840 --> 29:06.240
End of faith or then it's breaking the spell? Do you think those were all a result of 9-11?

29:06.240 --> 29:14.800
I think so. I think so. Possibly. Earlier in the podcast, you said something that triggered this

29:14.800 --> 29:21.360
odd idea. We were talking about elections in Trump and in the context of Trump,

29:21.360 --> 29:30.240
he immediately brought up reality shows. And it just made me wonder, what if the elections are

29:30.240 --> 29:37.840
a reality show and have been since, say, JFK debated Nixon in 1960 on TV. That was the first

29:37.840 --> 29:45.280
televised debate. What if the election has been a reality show ever since? What if?

29:48.880 --> 29:57.200
And when it gets through the free world for four years. Yeah. It could be, I guess. I think

29:57.200 --> 30:04.320
everything is possible. But the question would be, who is producing the reality show? Who's

30:04.320 --> 30:15.840
okaying it? Maybe it's the media. Let's see. Let's follow the money. There's a lot of spending

30:15.840 --> 30:28.080
on elections. Where does that money go? I would imagine mostly goes to media. Some lobbyists,

30:28.080 --> 30:37.920
maybe, to shift the position. Elections are all about advertising. That's right. So advertisers.

30:37.920 --> 30:47.520
Yeah, they're running the federal election reality show. Yeah, that's awesome. Well,

30:47.520 --> 30:54.880
you're right by saying that let's follow the money and see where it leads because everything

30:54.880 --> 31:01.760
is basically money. Well, that's been Bernie Sanders being complete this election cycle,

31:01.760 --> 31:08.640
isn't it? The big business owns the politicians. I think that's absolutely true. The politicians

31:08.640 --> 31:14.240
are absolutely corrupt. It's special interests that control legislation. That's been proven

31:14.240 --> 31:25.520
statistically. Yes. That makes a lot of sense. So he offers a solution to add even more

31:25.520 --> 31:32.160
legislation to prevent this sort of thing. But that might make it worse. That just adds more

31:32.160 --> 31:38.800
regulations to be that it would be subject to regulatory capture. It's just a bigger government.

31:39.760 --> 31:43.920
The more power the government has, the more value there is in controlling it.

31:43.920 --> 31:55.920
Right. That's very true. Jeremy, what's his family name? He wrote a book, Future Money,

31:57.360 --> 32:02.880
and our friend Nicola interviewed him too, which he's talking about.

32:02.880 --> 32:09.920
Is that Rivkin? Rivkin. Yes, Jeremy Rivkin. Thanks. A zero margin society.

32:09.920 --> 32:19.920
How do you think that kind of a society will affect this money talks? Can you describe what

32:21.600 --> 32:30.880
in a way that, let's say, more and more human resources being replaced by machines.

32:31.600 --> 32:34.800
So you don't have to pay them salary. You don't have to pay for their...

32:34.800 --> 32:39.200
You don't have to pay payment. Is it the argument that robots are going to put

32:39.200 --> 32:44.800
everyone out of work? That money will have no value. Basically, the end of capitalism.

32:46.160 --> 32:54.320
That's the idea. There will be no money in this way. But is there still value in this society?

32:55.680 --> 33:01.840
Value is a concept? Will people value one thing over another? Will they value living

33:01.840 --> 33:08.080
in one place over another? Will they value seeing somebody talk or seeing some show more than another?

33:08.080 --> 33:14.720
You know what they were saying that in the past 20 years, apparently, a trend has begun that

33:16.400 --> 33:20.960
a newer generation, a younger generation, they're not buying houses anymore. They rent.

33:24.320 --> 33:27.360
A lot of people go to college, but a lot of people don't go to college

33:27.360 --> 33:37.200
because it's a very big bet. I went to film school and I still have not paid my student loan fully.

33:38.160 --> 33:46.160
So you think about, because when you spend money, it's about a business. Am I making

33:46.160 --> 33:53.840
the right investment? Am I going to get anything back from it? And that just adds to it. It's like

33:53.840 --> 34:01.520
buying a house. It's like you have a mortgage before even you graduated. So more and more

34:01.520 --> 34:08.800
people are shifting, I think, towards individualism. And I think this is actually a time that Ayn Rand

34:08.800 --> 34:16.560
got to get big again. More and more people will be interested in objectivism and think about

34:16.560 --> 34:25.280
yourself. But isn't staying away from mortgages and renting instead just a shift from long-term

34:25.280 --> 34:36.640
investment to short-term flexibility? I don't know. I don't know. I'm confused about how you

34:36.640 --> 34:45.360
derive some trend towards individualism from that. It's not from that. I think it's just an

34:45.360 --> 34:55.120
observation about our social life that in early 90s, you would see boomboxes and a group of people

34:55.120 --> 35:00.080
gathering around it and walking on the street under a shoulder. One person has a boombox on

35:00.080 --> 35:04.560
the shoulder and five, six other people walking with them. People were talking more to each other.

35:04.560 --> 35:12.080
You don't have to talk to anybody literally anymore. Yeah, I'm with you. I'm not saying it

35:12.080 --> 35:20.160
in the way that, oh, even if it was like old days, I'm not a fan of that at all. But I think

35:20.160 --> 35:30.320
it is more about, it's less dependent on a group, which I think is a good thing. When you have

35:30.320 --> 35:35.360
Instagram and the culture of selfie, for example, why is it that big, you think?

35:35.360 --> 35:49.760
That's a mystery to me. That people have been a fan of it since it's crazy. It's one of those

35:49.760 --> 35:57.600
things that begun with being able to take a photo of yourself and see yourself with a phone and

35:57.600 --> 36:03.840
selfie has begun. It's just a no-brainer. Kim Kardashian has a book of selfies. I don't know

36:03.840 --> 36:07.840
if you know about that. I did not. Yeah, full of selfies. But thanks for telling me.

36:10.640 --> 36:15.680
So I don't think it's a bad thing. I think we are dependent less on group. Maybe it's a,

36:15.680 --> 36:22.080
maybe you could look at these selfie trends as kind of an artistic expression. I'm all for

36:22.080 --> 36:29.840
having online avatars and having many of them. I consider none of them are identical to me.

36:29.840 --> 36:38.000
They're crafted or designed by me for specific purposes in specific communities. I've got a

36:38.000 --> 36:43.280
social one on Facebook. I've got a very professional one on LinkedIn. And every different community

36:43.280 --> 36:50.320
I'm in, I have a different persona for that community. And I don't really worry about

36:50.320 --> 36:57.680
privacy very much because I only enter the data for that persona that I want to be associated

36:57.680 --> 37:03.120
with that persona. Privacy, I'm not concerned about that at all. And I think people are freaking out

37:03.120 --> 37:09.600
about something that hasn't existed in many, many years. It's like, there was a really cool

37:09.600 --> 37:16.960
interview with Larry Ellison on, I watched it on YouTube, Oracle. Yeah. And they're talking about

37:16.960 --> 37:22.560
NSA and the effect of that. And he's like, do you know who, before NSA had all your information,

37:22.560 --> 37:30.000
credit card companies? And there was an article, and I think MIT

37:31.120 --> 37:38.880
publication too, about how privacy has died. And it's a very new thing. And it has died already.

37:38.880 --> 37:48.400
How people have always favored comfort and accessibility to privacy. But people are making

37:48.400 --> 37:53.200
a huge deal out of it. And at the same time, like Facebook does that, Google does that,

37:53.200 --> 37:59.600
don't use them then. Right. Exactly. And if you want to keep something private, I think it's

37:59.600 --> 38:06.880
your responsibility to encrypt it or use secure channels. I agree. Technology is the solution.

38:06.880 --> 38:12.560
Absolutely. It's your responsibility to learn new ways to protect yourself and your information.

38:12.560 --> 38:19.360
Exactly. I feel the same way about when you're saying, Google is selling our information.

38:20.240 --> 38:26.640
So that's not a good thing. Google is not charging you for anything. So you can use anything. And

38:26.640 --> 38:33.920
then that's their business model. Right. That's the cost of using Google. Exactly. So don't use it.

38:33.920 --> 38:41.440
If it's too expensive, then don't. Yeah. Don't use, use DuckDuckGo or whatever else,

38:41.440 --> 38:48.320
which is pretty cool. It's not Google. I guess the opponents are mistaking these companies for

38:48.320 --> 38:58.160
charities. Yeah. Like you, the users are the product. They're not really hiding that fact.

38:58.160 --> 39:03.120
Absolutely. They don't charge you. They do charge their advertisers. You are the product.

39:03.120 --> 39:06.240
Absolutely. And there's nothing wrong with that, I don't think.

39:08.000 --> 39:11.280
That's your side of the bargain. Yeah. That's why you get all these great,

39:11.280 --> 39:15.760
facilities. This is where we are now, you know, and I see it in a way that

39:17.440 --> 39:23.920
from the time that man has sat in the cave and decided I want to go outside, that's a decision

39:23.920 --> 39:29.360
that you made and everything else that can happen to you outside of that cave are the

39:29.360 --> 39:34.720
alternative of that decision. So don't leave if you don't want to deal with anything. It's the

39:34.720 --> 39:40.480
same thing. If you don't want to deal with these things, don't use internet. You know, people make

39:40.480 --> 39:47.440
the same thing about aging. I think the age reversal aging technology that there are a couple of

39:49.040 --> 39:55.520
organizations that are working on it. That that's impossible. If you take this, this is like one

39:55.520 --> 40:01.040
of the stupidest things I've ever heard. If you take death out of life, life has no meaning.

40:01.680 --> 40:08.720
I've heard that a lot. Yeah. Maybe for you. The meaning for me is that I want to live and

40:08.720 --> 40:17.680
not being stuck with being alive. But I don't want to be stuck with dying either. I want to have

40:17.680 --> 40:24.000
options. You know, and I'm seeing it in a way that when we get to a point that we can back up our

40:24.000 --> 40:31.680
brain inside the machine, maybe one of me want to be backed up in the dropbox of a future. And

40:31.680 --> 40:36.480
then I just want to commit suicide because I want to know how that feels. And then that

40:36.480 --> 40:40.880
version of me, my backup continues. I'm like, Oh, cool. I don't even remember.

40:43.200 --> 40:52.480
Yeah. That's might absolutely be possible. We have uploads. Do you expect to see uploads within

40:52.480 --> 41:07.920
your lifetime? It's very hard to say like it's Yeah.

41:12.000 --> 41:18.560
Also, you know, I guess, if technology and science advance in a rate that they have been advancing,

41:18.560 --> 41:30.000
and no major thing happens, possibly. But you don't really know, you know, I mean,

41:30.000 --> 41:38.560
it's it's a crazy world. The fact that it's funny when this whole ISIL thing began began in Iraq.

41:40.960 --> 41:46.880
I was telling my friends, this is a very good thing that it's Iraq, because if it was Pakistan,

41:46.880 --> 41:51.440
for example, they have nuclear weapon, they would have nuclear weapon, the game will be

41:51.440 --> 41:58.880
very different than and now they're in Afghanistan. You know, and I was watching a documentary about

41:58.880 --> 42:06.800
it today by frontline. It's very good. ISIS in Afghanistan. And they're saying a lot of Taliban,

42:06.800 --> 42:14.320
they're leaving Taliban to join ISIS because ISIS pays $700 a month for each fighter. Apparently,

42:14.320 --> 42:20.080
that's a rate. And that's a lot of money. So they did they joined them. So when that's

42:20.720 --> 42:24.000
so the Taliban's working with them were no, it's joining ISIS.

42:24.720 --> 42:31.360
ISIS is fighting Taliban, but they're men, but they're members of Taliban who've

42:31.360 --> 42:35.600
deserted Taliban and they're continuing doing that because ISIS pays more.

42:36.560 --> 42:40.640
That's the thing. Also, do they think they want to join the winning side?

42:40.640 --> 42:47.520
I would think that having a higher pay rate isn't going to help if you're on the losing side.

42:48.720 --> 42:52.640
Well, I mean, I don't know, because well, ISIS,

42:55.040 --> 43:00.560
at the same time, it's very hard to kind of imagine what would a Taliban know information wise, like

43:02.000 --> 43:10.240
it's very difficult to judge because it's the opposite side of the side that we are on and

43:10.240 --> 43:16.880
watching the news and conceiving the news. For that Taliban, the problem as they're explaining

43:16.880 --> 43:21.760
is that we don't need ISIS because we already have Islamic government under Taliban.

43:23.440 --> 43:28.640
But then they're making the argument some of the Taliban who desert because it's just a religion

43:28.640 --> 43:41.520
filled with loopholes. It's like, no, it says in the Quran that when there is a caliphate,

43:42.800 --> 43:52.240
which is like the state, Islamic state, then you have to join that. It's an obligation for you.

43:52.240 --> 43:59.280
So with all these insane people around the world, if they get ahold of some serious weapon, they can

43:59.280 --> 44:07.040
cause a massive pause to this whole thing. At the same time, they might speed things up,

44:10.320 --> 44:19.120
like Manhattan Project. It was because of war that we build, not we Americans built,

44:19.120 --> 44:27.680
uh, West allies built nuclear weapon, nuclear bomb. And then again, it was because of war that

44:27.680 --> 44:37.360
we went to the moon. Cold war. And then it stopped and we haven't gone back to the moon or anywhere

44:37.360 --> 44:44.560
else. And we are started doing it now, maybe because Chinese are getting there too. They said

44:44.560 --> 44:50.880
they're going to land the man on the moon 2020 or something like that, which is not even comparable.

44:50.880 --> 44:57.680
And I like the Chinese system, but I much rather speak in English and deal with you like about

44:57.680 --> 45:05.200
the Chinese system. I think Chinese have figured out their country so well and mix two different

45:05.200 --> 45:10.880
systems together so well. And they're so strict about it that they've been getting China to where

45:10.880 --> 45:16.800
it is now. But at the same time, China has become a bubble because it has a very small percentage

45:16.800 --> 45:23.280
of really, really rich people now. And then you go to central China and all those farmlands and it's

45:23.280 --> 45:32.320
just like 16th century. But they're the best capitalists in the world, I think. But again,

45:32.320 --> 45:40.800
like Vietnam now, you can hire people much cheaper than China, for example, Philippines.

45:40.800 --> 45:46.560
So a lot of businesses are going for clothing and stuff. I know it's going to Vietnam. It has

45:46.560 --> 45:56.240
been going to Vietnam for years now. But with less dependence on China, it also depends a lot on

45:56.240 --> 46:04.560
how we can improve our manufacturing technologies in the West, in the West. So 3D printing or

46:04.560 --> 46:13.360
machines running things. I think they've, but they also have a brain program, right?

46:14.400 --> 46:18.640
Which Ben Goertzel is working with. Who's the other guy?

46:18.640 --> 46:29.360
Oh, right. Ben Goertzel, mean the brain in software? I know the guy who Ben Goertzel is working with,

46:31.200 --> 46:38.320
who's also in Ray Kurzweil's documentary. He has a very negative perspective about artificial

46:38.320 --> 46:48.880
intelligence, Hugo. Hugo Degares. Yes, yes. And his artillect war. He sees a coming global violent

46:48.880 --> 46:55.200
war between the humans and the AIs. What do you think about that? Well, it's certainly a possibility.

46:55.200 --> 47:02.320
That's why the Machine Intelligence Research Institute exists. That's why Elon Musk and Bill

47:02.320 --> 47:10.480
Gates and the other scientists have joined in raising the issue around. Do you think it's

47:10.480 --> 47:16.720
going to be, because it's like one of the biggest concerns that makes sense, as you explained. That

47:16.720 --> 47:22.080
is, there's a possibility that there will be conflict in that way. Do you think it will be

47:22.080 --> 47:30.320
between humans and machines or humans and human machine fusion? This third thing, because I'm

47:30.320 --> 47:46.480
thinking, if you have, for example, nanobots inside your brain and you evolve, you become the third

47:46.480 --> 47:53.200
thing. I think if there is a symbiosis between humans and AI, if every human has an AI partner

47:53.200 --> 48:05.440
or a bunch of them, then that is a path to a safe future. That's the best possible future,

48:05.440 --> 48:13.120
I think. But wouldn't it be like... The problem would be if there's a single AI that's not human

48:13.120 --> 48:20.640
and not associated with any human that is competing with us for resources and it doesn't

48:20.640 --> 48:30.800
necessarily have any values shared with us. But that's terrifying, but at the same time,

48:33.040 --> 48:38.720
wouldn't that represent a population on Earth right now? Like I'm thinking, imagine

48:39.520 --> 48:46.560
a fundamentalist Christian would have their own AI. It would be the projection of them.

48:46.560 --> 48:53.120
Or you think the AI would have the ability to think... I think the AI and the human together

48:53.120 --> 49:04.160
would be a new, greater entity. Yes, that's exactly. To other people or other agents,

49:04.160 --> 49:10.080
it would look like a single agent, but it's actually a synthesis of the two.

49:10.080 --> 49:18.160
It's connected to the same network, basically. Neural network. Possibly. Yeah. Do you think

49:18.160 --> 49:22.720
they have to though? The way the Tesla machines, for example, they're communicating with each other

49:22.720 --> 49:32.000
now, that again can bring up the privacy issue and all of that because the information that

49:32.000 --> 49:36.000
my car has, I don't want to share it. But if you don't want to share it, you wouldn't be able to

49:36.000 --> 49:43.760
take advantage of the full possibility of that enhancement. So same thing with AI. Don't you

49:43.760 --> 49:51.520
think if they're... I always think of the same thing with open source, AI to reach its full

49:51.520 --> 49:59.920
potential. It has to be open source. Probably. Yeah. It's full potential, yeah. What would be the other

49:59.920 --> 50:09.360
way? The other way to what? The other way to have a functional, superior intellectually,

50:10.000 --> 50:14.400
artificial intelligence by not having it open source. What would be the other way?

50:16.320 --> 50:24.240
It's a proprietary company organization can keep it to themselves just the way software companies

50:24.240 --> 50:35.360
do already. Most source code is not open source. Right. You mentioned HoloLens and Oculus Rift.

50:35.360 --> 50:44.160
We know that 2016 is the year that virtual reality will enter a mainstream market.

50:45.440 --> 50:52.960
At least the commercial early adopter market. Yeah. Well, it's been around for a couple of years

50:52.960 --> 50:59.680
now. Just the development kits. Yeah. But it's become more accessible. You can pre-order Oculus

50:59.680 --> 51:06.160
now. I think it's 599. Just a couple of days ago. Which is awesome. I was waiting for this

51:07.680 --> 51:18.000
version, Crescent Bay, because it has the headphones now. And for me, as an audio engineer

51:18.000 --> 51:23.600
and sound designer, this is like amazing because this is like the difference between black and

51:23.600 --> 51:34.000
white and color TV to me. It's when you can create virtual 360 sonic environments, which is a necessity

51:34.000 --> 51:39.440
for virtual reality worlds to be believable. The sound has to be there. It's just an amazing

51:39.440 --> 51:45.760
opportunity after years of just doing the same thing, basically. How do you think virtual

51:45.760 --> 51:52.880
reality will start affecting, as you said, early adopters and then how it's going to get into

51:52.880 --> 51:57.680
mainstream and how people will feel about it and what do you think people will use it for and how

51:57.680 --> 52:04.880
it's going to change everything? Well, for the first couple of years, at least, I think the

52:04.880 --> 52:11.600
major markets are going to be an entertainment, probably mostly computer games. The Rift is coming

52:11.600 --> 52:19.680
out packaged with the game Eve Valkyrie, a 3D space game, and the videos that I've seen on

52:19.680 --> 52:25.360
YouTube are mind-blowing. I cannot wait to try this out. I'm a big fan of Eve anyway, so...

52:25.360 --> 52:32.320
That's awesome. This is going to be really interesting. But I think almost any 3D computer

52:32.320 --> 52:37.040
game is going to lend itself to the Rift and the developers. The games are going to

52:37.040 --> 52:44.720
incorporate integration points. They'll support the Rift and other similar devices like the HTC.

52:47.280 --> 52:52.800
And then what we'll see then is the price point is going to come down due to volume,

52:52.800 --> 52:56.880
and the next generation is going to be just like we've seen with smartphones.

52:56.880 --> 53:01.520
Oh, absolutely. I think it's smart. I can't remember who said that. Maybe Elon Musk said

53:01.520 --> 53:08.080
that years ago that always wait for the third generation of a technology. Because by the

53:08.080 --> 53:13.680
time it gets to the third generation, it's working good enough and it's priced well enough

53:14.720 --> 53:22.000
for everybody to use it, basically. It's a bit difficult to predict the next market

53:22.000 --> 53:32.720
after games, but you can see getting into education easily and 3D movies. Journalism also.

53:33.600 --> 53:41.280
Yeah. There's been a movie commissioned by Vice, Vice Media, that they made in Syria,

53:41.280 --> 53:50.000
and it's 360. I haven't seen it, but you can't imagine how big of a difference it makes when

53:50.000 --> 53:56.720
you're in the middle of that environment to really feel it and get connected to it. And also,

53:56.720 --> 54:07.360
you take away the middleman. Because more and more, I'm imagining when citizen journalists,

54:07.360 --> 54:11.680
they start arising because of blogging and because of how easy you got to take photos

54:11.680 --> 54:18.640
and videos and put it on YouTube and all those other websites. It will be possible

54:18.640 --> 54:26.720
to make a 360 video quite soon, I think. I think it already is. There's an iPhone app for them.

54:27.360 --> 54:33.600
For 360 videos? Oh, that's amazing. I knew 360 cameras because one of the biggest

54:33.600 --> 54:41.200
challenge back then when they were have to put a couple of GoPro cameras, like four or eight or

54:41.200 --> 54:49.040
12 or something, to get a 360 image, the thing you had to put a lot of cameras. And then the

54:49.040 --> 54:55.440
image that it was giving you needed to be stitched. And the software to stitch those

54:56.800 --> 55:03.520
footage is very complex to work with. It was expensive. But again, like any other technology,

55:03.520 --> 55:12.400
you know, the first generation is basically the first step in trial and error. But now there are

55:12.400 --> 55:19.120
360 cameras that they cost maybe like 400 bucks, the price of a GoPro. And it gives you a already

55:19.120 --> 55:25.920
stitched image that you can use. So somebody in Syria, when they're in war and doing, you know,

55:25.920 --> 55:32.960
a video of, for example, whatever rally or attack or a terrorist, a suicide bomber or

55:32.960 --> 55:37.680
something like that. Of course, I will watch that over a footage that is being transcribed

55:37.680 --> 55:44.000
for me by CNN, for example. It might be in the minority there. Really? How many people want

55:44.000 --> 55:51.200
to experience a suicide bomber? I don't know. I would imagine if I'm interested in what's going

55:51.200 --> 55:59.120
on there, I want to kind of feel it to maybe it just gives you perspective, I think, in my opinion.

55:59.120 --> 56:09.440
Yeah, I think it could definitely have a lot of value. Maybe for films and TVs too, or treatments of

56:11.040 --> 56:17.040
I know that they're using that. There was a video of this girl who was claustrophobic.

56:17.840 --> 56:24.960
And she was so extreme that she couldn't take elevators. So they designed a game for her that

56:24.960 --> 56:32.080
was emulating her being inside the elevator. And she trained with that and she she took an elevator

56:32.080 --> 56:38.880
for first year after who knows how many years and it's amazing. So in therapy and treatment.

56:38.880 --> 56:46.160
Yeah, absolutely. PTSD. They've they've been trying that. I'm looking forward to that. It's

56:46.160 --> 56:54.800
apparently one of the biggest products and technology in CES. This year was also about

56:55.440 --> 56:58.960
virtual reality, everything about virtual reality. So this is the year.

57:02.080 --> 57:09.600
As a last question before my last standard question, which I will ask everybody. But last

57:09.600 --> 57:20.480
question of series of question conversations that we've had. How do you think ethics and morality

57:21.440 --> 57:26.080
will translate for an artificial intelligence?

57:29.840 --> 57:32.400
Well, let's see. Pretty deep question.

57:32.400 --> 57:41.520
One way to look at AI is it's a system designed to make choices based on its goals and beliefs.

57:43.280 --> 57:50.720
An AI that's extremely smart, super intelligent, will tend to have very accurate and sophisticated

57:50.720 --> 58:01.040
beliefs. The goals are basically beliefs about preferences, which states of the world are preferable

58:01.040 --> 58:05.040
to other states of the world. Can we even conceive what those beliefs will be?

58:06.320 --> 58:14.640
It's we can conceive of hard coding beliefs in such a way that the AI will be unable to

58:15.440 --> 58:22.400
change its own goals. But at the same time, that may very well cripple the AI in the sense that

58:22.400 --> 58:29.440
it won't be able to get past certain level of sophistication or intelligence if we

58:29.440 --> 58:34.240
cripple its ethical system. So presumably, if it's much smarter than humans.

58:34.240 --> 58:36.720
Oh, absolutely. As it should be. As it should be.

58:36.720 --> 58:45.760
We can't really expect to force our own morality, per se, on a machine that's supposed to be much

58:45.760 --> 58:51.520
better and bigger and the evolution of us. But that is exactly the project of friendly AI,

58:52.160 --> 58:58.480
is to enforce our own values onto the AI. But our values aren't that good. We still lie.

58:58.480 --> 59:02.560
There's a problem. We're not that good ourselves.

59:02.560 --> 59:03.200
We are not.

59:03.200 --> 59:06.320
We don't even know what would be good.

59:07.760 --> 59:15.840
I mean, we have no rigorous way of proving that any set of values is better than any other set.

59:15.840 --> 59:24.560
It's also very confusing to, for example, it's very interesting how it comes to you when you

59:24.560 --> 59:28.640
talk about these kind of things with children, because children have no filter and they just

59:28.640 --> 59:34.960
ask you whatever that comes to their mind. You can't tell a child that killing is wrong

59:35.600 --> 59:41.440
as a rule, because then he or she will be asking why those people are dying then.

59:41.440 --> 59:44.080
Why, you know.

59:44.080 --> 59:47.040
You can tell them you just won't be very convincing.

59:47.040 --> 59:53.440
Exactly. And you can't say it as a rule, right? And that's like one of the biggest

59:53.440 --> 59:59.520
parts of morality, that killing is wrong. This is just an example. How are we going to explain

59:59.520 --> 01:00:04.960
that to an AI? And that is one of the first things that we need to explain it now that

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:11.760
you're talking about as we spoke about it in military, that an autonomous machine,

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:21.200
okay, killing is wrong, just wound people. But if this guy did this, then killing is fine.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:27.040
You can't really do that. And that's why I think a lot of these attempts, because

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:33.920
moralities are different from place to place. The morality that we have is a very different

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:40.480
morality that, for example, people have in Yemen, for instance. And at the same time,

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:47.920
the machine to get to its full potential, it needs to be open source. So like Watson

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:55.920
or IBM, it's open source. So if you have a strong enough of a hardware, you would be able to have.

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:00.880
Are you sure Watson's open source? I think so, because they were asking

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:12.160
for programmers and programmers mainly to use Watson capability and do their own projects.

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:22.720
But let's say an open source AI, it would be usable by some Chinese kid in his grandparents'

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:30.720
basement to build whatever he wants to build with it, or a Russian hacker, or an evil person,

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:36.880
per se, evil quote unquote. Yes, that's absolutely true. Ben Goertzel has his own

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:43.920
open source project, OpenCog, I think. And just a couple of weeks ago, Elon Musk and some Peter

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:49.120
Thiel, I think, and some other courts announced that they were funding another open source project,

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:54.480
OpenAI, and they were investing a... Peter Thiel was involved in that, so I didn't know that.

01:01:55.680 --> 01:02:02.960
I'm not sure, I think. I would call that. But I think they were putting something like a billion

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:11.600
dollars into this project, significant funding. And at the same time, they came into quite a bit

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:19.840
of criticism saying, if you think AI is dangerous, why on earth would you open source it? And the

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:25.040
analogy is made with nuclear arms. If you think nukes are dangerous, you certainly don't want to

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:31.520
publish an easy how-to on the web, because it could easily fall into the wrong hand. So why are

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:40.400
they doing it with AI? What's the explanation? I haven't heard their explanation. One possibility is

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:51.360
that unless you start looking into these issues right away, hardware is going to be at a point

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:56.480
sometime in the future that there might be an extremely quick ramp up time from human level

01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:03.440
to superhuman level AI, and we won't be prepared. So it's better to start now, even if it is dangerous.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:09.840
To slow it down, basically. Well, to be better prepared for when it happens,

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:16.720
even if you end up spinning it up in some ways. Would we know it when it happens, you think?

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:26.160
It depends how it is realized. I think if it's a pure AI rather than, say, a human emulation

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:32.160
where a brain is scanned and then emulated in the hardware to get an AI, if it's just a pure

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:41.520
code AI, it could happen in a small group that's secret. Maybe some company wants to build an AI

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:47.920
to do trading on the stock exchanges in order to make a lot of money. And it gets more and more

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:52.960
intelligent. It gathers more and more data in order to interpret the financial data coming in.

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:59.760
And so it builds up a belief system. All it wants to do is make money. And it gets very good at trading

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:06.240
and starts buying companies. But doing it in a way... That's a great idea for a movie.

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:12.640
But does it in a way that's decentralized using lots of versions of itself, lots of

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:18.560
subsidiaries that can't be traced back to the main AI so nobody realizes that it's all controlled by a

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:25.840
single mind until it owns so many resources, it can take over countries?

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:33.680
Would he want to take over countries? If it needs more resources. If that's its main goal is to

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:38.560
acquire resources, financial resources, it could become tremendously powerful

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:46.480
by controlling humans with its resources. Well, it could have a million people working

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:49.600
for it. They don't even know that they're all working for the same mind.

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:54.480
I think if the AI will be based on human morality, that's exactly what the AI would do.

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:57.680
Yeah, he will go after the money.

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:03.600
Until it can build the hardware to make it some robots.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:13.680
Yeah, that's very interesting. I think I've always enjoyed looking at things as much as I could

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:17.600
as a double-edged sword, everything, because they're good and bad about

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:23.520
literally everything. With a hammer, you can build a house so you can bash somebody's brains.

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:29.760
So it really depends on how we're using it and for what purpose we're using it. And I think

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:37.280
core values of us, unfortunately, have been corrupted a lot, a majority of people,

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:43.440
because of the money centric, money for the sake of money materialistic money.

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:53.920
Whereas I see that as a positive force. I do that people in the current system can

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:58.320
protect their own interests better and advance their own interests better

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.800
by serving others commercially.

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:04.720
Mm-hmm. That's interesting.

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:09.520
So it channels their own personal interests. Everyone is self-interested.

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:12.560
Even those that claim not to be, I think, are basically

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:15.840
deluding themselves and others.

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:18.720
Well, they believe as...

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:27.120
But the way to channel that self-interest into a net good for society is to put in a system where

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:32.800
you do well by helping others by selling them products and services, for example.

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:36.320
That's so interesting. Last night, we were watching the documentary called I Am.

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:46.480
It's about this director named Tom Shaliak. He directed a whole bunch of comedies and made

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:52.720
millions and millions of dollars. And then he went through this experience that he thought

01:06:52.720 --> 01:07:03.440
that he's going to die, and then he survived that. And he became very, you know, instead of

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:10.320
making our objective profit to make it how we can help each other and help each other grow.

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:16.400
And he was talking to his father and said, why can't we do that?

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:24.080
And his father said, it's a very nice utopian idea that will never, ever happen, you know.

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:31.600
And I think the key is everybody starts within themselves that you just make yourself a better

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:40.320
person and then try to get that understanding to the circle close to you and just expand the circle

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:50.560
more and more. And, you know, I think it would worth more to focus on what we can do individually

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:55.920
than what, why people aren't doing this and this and that, because people are, you know,

01:07:55.920 --> 01:08:04.640
built from individuals. But also, all these new technologies have given the opportunity

01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:11.280
empowered an individual to change the world if they have a right idea. Yeah, technology is making

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:16.880
people more powerful every day. Exactly. I think it's great and it's a great time that we can live

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:26.720
and enjoy all of these things. The last question literally is if you come in contact with a

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:37.200
species from another civilization with an alien, per se, intelligent aliens,

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:46.080
what would be the biggest achievement that you would mention to that intelligent alien

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:52.080
that we have made and we've achieved as a race? And what would be the biggest mistake that we've

01:08:52.080 --> 01:09:09.440
made? Wow. That's a big question. I would offer, actually, the World Wide Web is our greatest

01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:16.080
achievement. The technology that makes self-expression possible in collaboration,

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:24.960
I think it's instigated a renaissance across the world. It's amazing. And in a sense,

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:30.560
it's only getting started. So ask me 10 years from now and I'll say the successor for the web,

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:42.560
whatever that is. And as for our worst mistake, I think it's the war machines that we worship

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:48.400
as our nation-states, that they've caused more death, destruction, and suffering than anything

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:54.160
else in human history. And most people are blind to it, that they're proud citizens, they're

01:09:55.280 --> 01:10:01.040
proud of their nationality, their patriots, and they're brainwashed into thinking that

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:10.240
this is a good idea. I hope the aliens can shed some perspective on that. I hope they've overcome

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:14.400
it themselves. And if they've come here, I'm pretty sure they have. They haven't destroyed

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:22.080
themselves. So one more thing. I want to thank you very much for having me as your first guest.

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:27.760
I'm really flattered. Yeah, my pleasure, man. And it's been a blast. Yeah. It's been excellent.

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:40.880
Glad to hear. Thanks a lot. Thank you.
