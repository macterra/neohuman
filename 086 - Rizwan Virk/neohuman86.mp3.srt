1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
In the Greek traditions, philosophy, science and religion were not different.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:11,000
Plato is talking about all these things, Aristotle and Pythagoras, they were exploring the mysteries

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,720
and so I actually think the goal of religion, the goal of philosophy and the goal of science

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:22,160
is the same which is to try to understand the nature of the reality that we live in

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,360
and I actually think that most religions are founded when somebody peeks outside the simulation

6
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,960
as I like to call it, they peek outside the game and then they come back and they try

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,440
to describe what they saw which is very difficult to do because the base reality as it's called

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:44,280
may be very different than what we're used to here, so the laws of physics really could

9
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:55,280
be just the physics engine of our specific game.

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,680
Rizwan Virk, welcome to the 86th episode of the New Human Podcast.

11
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,480
Thanks for having me on your podcast.

12
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,480
It's a pleasure.

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,080
How are you doing in California with the pandemic and this crazy world that we're living in

14
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,080
right now?

15
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,720
Well, things were actually pretty calm where I am, California obviously has its set of

16
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:22,480
problems always related to wildfires especially today, we've got all kinds of haze from

17
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,840
fires all over the Bay Area but it just started yesterday, there was a little bit of lightning

18
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,000
and I guess they'd set some places on fire but other than that, I actually live right

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,920
down the road from Google and it's actually been quite calm because their 40,000 employees

20
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:45,320
have been staying at home so this area as I said hasn't been too crazy.

21
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,880
Let's start with your background, the work you've done, the lives you've lived and what

22
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,120
are you mainly focused on now these days?

23
00:01:51,120 --> 00:02:00,120
Sure, so I got my degree in computer science many years ago from MIT and became an entrepreneur

24
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,160
in the software industry, started off doing a bunch of enterprise software, kind of boring

25
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:11,880
stuff for some people, big IT departments used our product, thousands of them and then

26
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:17,680
after selling my last enterprise software company almost 10 years ago, I moved out to

27
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,840
Silicon Valley and got involved with video games and that was around the time that Facebook

28
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:31,560
had released games on its platform and also the iPhone had come out in 2007 and in 2008,

29
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,760
they introduced the App Store and so I got heavily, heavily involved in kind of this

30
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:42,040
nascent industry which was mobile gaming with a company called TapJoy which became one of

31
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,640
the biggest advertising companies in mobile and we made a game called TapFish which is

32
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,520
one of the top games in the early days of the App Store.

33
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,360
We ended up selling that to a big Japanese company and then I became more of an investor

34
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:01,880
and mentor and advisor to different startups and then a few years ago, I went back to MIT

35
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:09,040
and started PlayLabs which is a startup accelerator for playful technologies and also decided

36
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,240
to focus a little more on my writing and so I came out with the book The Simulation Hypothesis

37
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:20,840
last year on the 20th anniversary of the release of The Matrix which was March 31st, 1999 and

38
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:28,560
my book was released on March 31st, 2019 last year and so now I'm involved in a combination

39
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,520
of kind of futuristic types of activities around virtual reality.

40
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,320
Also I'm an investor still in many different startups, I'm writing new books and kind

41
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:48,560
of parallel with my journey in the software world, I was an explorer of many states of

42
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,640
consciousness whether it was meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, lots of other practices and so

43
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,600
I became interested in consciousness and how it interacts with the physical world and so

44
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,520
the book The Simulation Hypothesis was a way of tying all of that together really for me

45
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,720
for areas that I've investigated over many, many years.

46
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,440
That's awesome and it really is this combination of consciousness and simulation hypothesis

47
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:20,320
that you're talking about that interested me initially about I thought I need to talk

48
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,120
to him and you also have a new book called Startup Myth and Models What You Won't Learn

49
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,160
in Business School, I want to talk to you about that a little bit later but let's start

50
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,560
with The Simulation Hypothesis and MIT computer scientist shows why AI, quantum physics and

51
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,920
eastern mystics all agree we are in a video game.

52
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:47,400
Can you describe the thesis of the book and what interested you beside Matrix to write

53
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,160
the book at the first place?

54
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:55,920
Yeah, well you know a few years ago I was heavily involved in virtual reality startups

55
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:02,120
and so I was actually visiting one of them and they had a VR ping pong game that was

56
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,920
going to be released by HTC who are makers of the Vive headset which was one of the big

57
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:12,240
headsets along with Oculus when virtual reality was sort of making a comeback and so as I

58
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,200
was playing this ping pong game, I found that it was so realistic in terms of the responsiveness

59
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,840
that I forgot I was in a virtual reality.

60
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,240
So much so that at the end of the game I decided to put the paddle down on the table and lean

61
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,240
against the table.

62
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,560
Of course there was no table, I was just in a room with these goggles on and so the controller

63
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,800
fell to the floor and I almost fell over.

64
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,360
And how long did it take from the time that you start playing the game to being convinced

65
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,720
that you're basically in that environment?

66
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
It didn't take very long.

67
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,800
I mean these were relatively short games so it was less than 10 minutes total that I was

68
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,160
playing and what's interesting about that is that it wasn't even the resolution.

69
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:59,060
So when we talk about the Matrix, we think of super high resolution virtual worlds which

70
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,080
look just like the physical world and we'll talk about how we get there.

71
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,120
But in this case, the resolution graphics were not that realistic.

72
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,120
It was more the physics engine.

73
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:16,800
It was the way that I heard the sound of the ball just when I was about to tap it and depending

74
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,920
on where I tapped it, it went and it reacted based upon how I hit it.

75
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:28,600
And so really the responsiveness was actually the key to this immersion more so than what

76
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,920
we think of which is the pixel resolution.

77
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:38,100
Turns out that we have pretty good pixel resolution already and most movies you see when we had

78
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:45,200
cinemas open like Star Wars or Blade Runner 2049, they're digital these days and they

79
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,480
get sent at a 2K pixel resolution.

80
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:55,020
Well it turns out we have 4K resolution screens and 8K on the way and so we're getting very

81
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,440
good at getting the pixel resolution but it was really that responsiveness.

82
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,360
So I started to think, well what would it take for technology to develop to what I call

83
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,960
the simulation point which is the point at which we can produce simulations that are

84
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,540
so realistic that we would not be able to distinguish those from physical reality, completely

85
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,200
immersive like the Matrix really.

86
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:23,960
And so that was how I started writing the book but then as I started to investigate

87
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,880
this idea, I realized that it was being taken seriously now whereas 20 years ago when The

88
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,640
Matrix came out, it was considered science fiction and before that, the works of Philip

89
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:40,880
K. Dick were very inspirational to the makers of The Matrix but also in providing a framework

90
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,560
in science fiction to talk about the idea that what you're seeing might not be real,

91
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,760
that there may be invented worlds or false memories for example.

92
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:55,400
And so that led to the writing of the rest of the book and part of the book really delves

93
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,360
into the idea that this isn't a new idea, that all the world religions have been talking

94
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,200
about this for some period of time and so I was able to kind of tie that together as

95
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,200
well.

96
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,160
Very interesting.

97
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,600
I'm glad that you mentioned the effect of sound because I'm coming from the background

98
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,680
of sound design and I've been working on this, making the shift from the 2D kind of

99
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:22,980
an environment into VR and AR kind of an environment and there's a huge difference between how

100
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:27,960
those sounds for example or visuals are being produced.

101
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,680
There's a big difference between stereo sounds and binaural sounds that you feel like

102
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,240
you're in the environment and as you're saying, if you close your eyes, it takes a

103
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,680
matter of seconds for you to feel like, yeah, I'm walking in New York City.

104
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,480
Right and with the sounds, this idea of 3D sound for people that aren't familiar with

105
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:52,000
it, it's the idea that if sound is coming from over there, that corner of the room,

106
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,720
it will hit my ear slightly differently, my right ear and my left ear versus something

107
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,080
that's right in front of me or something that's right behind me and so trying to

108
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,960
simulate that digitally by knowing the X, Y, Z coordinates which is actually a lot of

109
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,280
what we do in virtual reality visuals.

110
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:15,800
If you go back to the 1980s when I started writing video games, my first game was a tic

111
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:21,200
tac toe program on the Commodore 64 and then on Apple II computers.

112
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,040
Back then if you asked somebody, can you make a fully immersive 3D world like World of Warcraft

113
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,320
which it's not fully immersive, it's not even virtual reality but it's a 3D world

114
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,320
that you play on your computer and the answer would be no, there are just too many pixels.

115
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,780
There's no way we could render all of that and keep track of all of that and so what

116
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,740
happened between then and now, well, Moore's Law happened which states that the computing

117
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:49,280
power doubles every 18 months but more than that, we came up with optimization techniques.

118
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:55,080
We came up with ways to compress the data and so the rule of thumb was look at your

119
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:01,080
point of view inside the virtual world, inside the 3D world and render only those pixels

120
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:06,640
which can be observed by your avatar and so anything that cannot be observed, you don't

121
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
have to render.

122
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:15,360
That was a key optimization technique that allowed for 3D graphics with games like Doom

123
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,560
back in the 90s which was so popular that it was bringing college networks down because

124
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,440
it was a first person shooter and when you turn left or right, it looked like the world

125
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:30,840
moved with you and if you look at like really old versions of this, Microsoft Flight Simulator

126
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:36,960
which was supposed to simulate flying an airplane back in the 80s or 90s when they first came

127
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,520
out with it, you could see the lines being rendered across the screen every time you

128
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,880
move so you turn to the left and you would wait for it to render the scene.

129
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,220
Today, they have a version of Flight Simulator in beta that is based on Bing maps and they

130
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:56,120
took all the maps of the physical world that they could, satellite images and they created

131
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,520
using AI 3D models of like a billion buildings so you could literally fly over New York City

132
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,880
and look down and have it look like the buildings in New York City and so it's pretty impressive

133
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,320
what's happened and a lot of this was because of 3D rendering techniques, that's kind

134
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,560
of how we got to where we're able to do it.

135
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,760
It's very similar now with 3D sound, there's a lot of work being done on how to reproduce

136
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,760
that digitally without having to worry so much about where the physical sound is and

137
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:28,280
then you add that to the goggles, now you're in a very immersive type of world.

138
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:33,640
This advancement depends on the computational processing power, right?

139
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,400
So we're based on silicon right now but my understanding is that we are reaching the

140
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:42,440
limits of silicon and we have to move to the next mode of computation.

141
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:48,120
How is that going to affect the future of simulating our world I guess?

142
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:55,960
Well, we do seem to be approaching a theoretical limit but what you find is that that was thought

143
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:01,800
to be the case before and so I remember when I was in business school at Stanford here

144
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:07,280
just down the road, we had a case study from Intel saying that if they had continued to

145
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,000
make processors the way that they were making them, you know what happens is the processors

146
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,840
get smaller and they do more computations and when they do more computations, it produces

147
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,720
more heat and so the engineers were doing a little analysis that said okay as the number

148
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,120
of computations increase, how will the heat increase and they said it was going to be

149
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,240
hotter than the sun if it keeps going after a few years.

150
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,360
Now what happened was they came up with different computational techniques and so optimization

151
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,880
was actually the key.

152
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:41,160
Turns out that was the normal like the 286-386 Pentium processor and that was the normal

153
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,520
track but there was a parallel group at Intel making processors for laptops which used a

154
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:51,880
lot less energy and produced a lot less heat and they used reduced instruction sets so

155
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,860
reduced number of computations so it's all about optimization and so I think we're not

156
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,280
quite at the theoretical limits and won't be for a while because people will come up

157
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:06,920
with new optimization techniques and adding other hardware like GPUs so graphics processing

158
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:13,240
units are pretty common now and they were invented primarily for video games and entertainment

159
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,400
like what do you need graphics for, right, it's to render these kinds of things.

160
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:22,480
Now if you look at virtual reality headsets, there was a wave back in the 90s where you

161
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,520
know they had to be hooked up to like very big machines and then in 2012 I think it was

162
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,480
Facebook bought Oculus for a couple of billion dollars and that was kind of the new resurgence

163
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,600
of virtual reality but one of the problems was you know just like with my headset here

164
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,040
which has this wire, you had to be connected to the computer with a wire because the computer

165
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:47,280
was doing the processing and so the difficulty with virtual reality is not so much displaying

166
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:53,200
it on a small screen which you know they have the two screens on your eyes, it's calculating

167
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,040
what should be rendered in real time so that when you turn to the left or you turn to the

168
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,400
right, it doesn't do what the old flight simulator would do and show you line by line

169
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,840
I'm re-rendering what it might look like but now you know we have the Oculus Quest

170
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,080
which came out last year and HTC has its own kind of version where you don't need a computer

171
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:16,600
and you don't need a phone, all the computation is done in the headset itself so we're already

172
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,040
seeing kind of standalone virtual reality which is showing that we'll be able to do

173
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,600
more and more computation.

174
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:29,560
That said, there is a lot of work being done on light so the reason we have fiber optics

175
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:35,720
is instead of transferring over copper wires, you basically use light to transmit bits of

176
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:42,000
data because in the end, our computation today is all based on bits, ones and zeros.

177
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,080
I know how we're talking right now, I'm not really talking to you, I'm actually seeing

178
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,440
bits that were transferred over the internet and they're being re-rendered on my side

179
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:57,080
and I'm being rendered on your side and one of us is doing the recording etc.

180
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,720
So there's some work being done there but I think really the next frontier for computing

181
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,840
that a lot of people are looking at is quantum computing and the basic idea there is that

182
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:13,040
instead of using regular bits, so a regular bit has a one or a zero value, you use quantum

183
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:20,160
bits or qubits which have both a value of one and zero, it's called quantum superposition

184
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,840
and this quantum superposition has been one of the biggest mysteries in the world of quantum

185
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:29,640
mechanics and I talk a lot about it in the book in general but as we apply it to computation,

186
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:36,760
what it means is that just like the old story of Schrodinger's cat where Schrodinger came

187
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,320
up with this analogy because he thought it was just ridiculous what quantum physics was

188
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,320
saying, unfortunately it's been verified, that's what it's saying which is that if

189
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,920
you have a cat in a box and it has some radioactive material, that after an hour, the cat has

190
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,560
a 50% chance of being alive and a 50% chance of being dead.

191
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:58,760
Now to us it seems logical that the cat is either alive or it's dead, we just don't

192
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,920
know which one, it can't be both, it's just one or the other.

193
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,880
What quantum physics tells us is that it is both alive and dead until somebody opens up

194
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:13,040
the box and makes a measurement or an observation of what's inside the box and so it exists

195
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:20,360
in this weird state of probabilistic reality and it turns out quantum computers are going

196
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,940
to try to use that to say you have a qubit and suppose you have 50 qubits, each of them

197
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,080
can be zero or one, well that's a pretty big number, it's two to the power 50 that

198
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:39,280
you can do whereas right now we have 32-bit or 64-bit processors on our computers but

199
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:44,060
with that you basically can do one measurement across all of them and so it makes it a lot

200
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:49,240
faster and now it's kind of confusing how it works but the basic idea is you have it

201
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,080
explore all the possible values.

202
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,760
So if you were to explore all the possible values of 64-bits, you would have to go through

203
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:02,280
two of the 64 iterations but with a quantum computer, you kind of let that run in this

204
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,640
probabilistic world and as you make a measurement, you collapse the probability wave just like

205
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,520
looking at Schrodinger's gap to see if it's alive or dead and so the idea is that that

206
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,120
would result in much faster computers.

207
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,120
Now there's some debate over whether quantum computers are really faster or you can optimize

208
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:24,440
classical computers to do the same thing and so I think IBM was able to get up to a certain

209
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:29,320
number of qubits now but it's still early days, it's kind of like 1980 for personal

210
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:35,580
computers when it comes to qubits or even earlier like 1960s when most computers were

211
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:41,160
mainframes so most quantum computers are like these giant things that sit in these super

212
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,520
cooled labs using superconductors.

213
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:51,380
The really hard thing about quantum computers is error detection and turns out this is another

214
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,680
basic optimization technique or algorithmic technique we use in software which is how

215
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:02,740
do you correct errors if you have millions of bits, if 10 of them are wrong.

216
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,720
Right now, same thing with your picture coming to me, what happens if a couple of those bits

217
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,640
gets transmitted wrongly?

218
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,940
Well we can figure out using error correction techniques, my hair should be this color,

219
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:19,160
my shirt is black, therefore that's probably should be black, it shouldn't be necessarily

220
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,920
a bunch of white bits there and so we use checksums and things like that and so that's

221
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,360
really where a lot of work has to be done still as well as the physical storage of these

222
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,640
qubits is still pretty hard because you have to do it at these very cold temperatures.

223
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,920
Is IBM the leader?

224
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:40,280
Because I know there's one company in Canada, D-Wave, that they've been right on top of

225
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:46,320
it for many, many years and they sold I think their machines to Google, that army company

226
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:52,760
McDonald something and so I'm interested to know who is the leader at this point in

227
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,760
quantum computing.

228
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,800
Well, so D-Wave was one of the earliest companies, maybe the first one to come out with a quantum

229
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,800
computer.

230
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:05,160
There's some debate over whether it's a true quantum computer or not and we won't

231
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:10,800
dig into that but they're out there, Google has a pretty big quantum computing department.

232
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:16,280
Microsoft actually is spending a lot of money on this as well and in fact, they're all

233
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:22,440
using slightly different approaches to the physical storage of these qubits.

234
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:28,200
It's kind of as if back in the day when Apple was making a personal computer, IBM

235
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,320
was making one, Commodore was making one, instead of all using silicon chips, one was

236
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:39,920
using Swiss cheese and one was using copper and one was using silicon.

237
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:44,400
That's kind of the stage we're at is they're still experimenting with what is the best

238
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,760
way to physically store these bits and I think Microsoft had a breakthrough where they were

239
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:54,480
able to do it at normal temperatures which is pretty important if quantum computing is

240
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,240
going to get out there more, you can't require this kind of negative 200 degrees Celsius

241
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,720
or whatever the temperature is to store these things.

242
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,120
All the big guys are actually running after it right now and then there's a lot of startups

243
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,520
that are working in this space more on the software side trying to come up with different

244
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,520
algorithms.

245
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:19,560
There's a lot of research, IBM put out a paper I think last year stating that there

246
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:24,320
in fact were some algorithms where there was quantum supremacy which is to prove that a

247
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,880
quantum computer can do this way faster than a classical computer.

248
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,060
It's not as easy as it sounds because even though theoretically it can be done, the way

249
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,600
you have to go in and measure these bits and collapse that probability wave is kind of

250
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,080
tricky even for a traditional programmer like I was trained as a traditional programmer,

251
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,520
you have to think almost very differently to make that transition into quantum programming.

252
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,200
Is the role of the programmer will become obsolete when we move to quantum computation

253
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,440
because of all the possibilities that exist that we inevitably have to rely on some kind

254
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,440
of AI or AGI ultimately?

255
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,560
Well I don't think it will become obsolete, I think it will change from the way we think

256
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,760
about it today.

257
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,240
Today we're writing procedural software or object-oriented software and already within

258
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:19,120
the coding world, let's see when was the basic programming language was invented?

259
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:24,880
I was probably back in the 70s or 60s so it's been about 50 years that we've had programming

260
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:30,680
and we're now getting to the no code stage which is a popular term in programming which

261
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,880
is for somebody who doesn't have to write any code, you just drag and drop things but

262
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,840
people have been talking about that for many years, I remember Steve Jobs making a big

263
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,200
deal of this when he left Apple and he created an X computer back in the 90s that you could

264
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,240
just take these objects and put them together.

265
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,440
Well it turns out it wasn't that simple, you still needed to do lots of actual code

266
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:54,240
writing and so today there's a big trend towards no code solutions but it's still

267
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,920
not there, we still have to write a lot of code so I think with quantum computing it

268
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:03,560
will be different, if you go to IBM's website, there's actually a way where you can upload

269
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:11,040
a program, a quantum computing program up to their computer and have it run on a time

270
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,040
shared basis.

271
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,800
So it's kind of like mainframe computers used to be like back in the days when Bill

272
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,760
Gates and Paul Allen before they started Microsoft in Seattle or at Harvard, they were working

273
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,720
on these mainframe computers and they would only get them for a certain period of time

274
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,280
and they would submit their programs and wait for them to run and get back the results.

275
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:34,760
So it's kind of in that world but there's visual representations of these bits, there

276
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,080
are languages like Qsharp which Microsoft is coming out with but I'd say it's still

277
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:44,120
a wide open area, I don't think the way that we do quantum programming today will be the

278
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:49,000
way we do it tomorrow so there will probably be some transition, I don't think right

279
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:56,160
away that AGI is going to be able to do computer programming but we're not even at AGI so

280
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,680
there's a big debate about whether we think we'll get there soon.

281
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:07,440
Now we're getting closer and closer, there are these text generation modules that didn't

282
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,200
quite pass the Turing test yet and your viewers may know about the Turing test which was put

283
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,600
forward by Alan Turing back in the 1950s I think when he said he called it the imitation

284
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,960
game and he said if you had a computer behind one curtain and a human behind another and

285
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:29,160
you're talking with them, back then he was saying you're sending teletype messages,

286
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,160
that's how they did that.

287
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:36,320
Today it might be an actual voice conversation or it might be a chat bot but if you can't

288
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,120
tell the difference between the computer and the human then that computer has passed the

289
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:47,120
imitation game and then you're at the point where it's AI, it's intelligent enough

290
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,560
because you can't really tell the difference between one or the other.

291
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:55,680
So we're not quite there yet, estimates range from a decade to several decades, most people

292
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:04,160
think we'll certainly get there within the century, I'm not so sure personally, the argument

293
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:10,680
is if you can't tell the difference between a machine and a human then we have basically

294
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,360
simulated consciousness.

295
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,280
So this is a big debate that says what is consciousness?

296
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,840
Wow, that is a huge point, yes.

297
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,400
So is a machine that acts like a conscious person actually conscious or not and if we

298
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,940
can't tell the difference, does it even matter?

299
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:33,140
And so this gets into the debate of can we take human consciousness and download it into

300
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,140
a computer.

301
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:39,400
So I talked about in this book the road to the simulation point, there are these 10 stages

302
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:45,200
and one of the stages is artificial intelligence bots that we can talk to but another stage

303
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,480
is this idea of being able to download your consciousness into a computer.

304
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:55,640
It's a very popular topic in Silicon Valley and people like Ray Kurzweil who I think his

305
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:01,640
official title is Chief Futurist at Google has been talking about this as a way of achieving

306
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:08,340
digital immortality but it's not something that we don't fully understand consciousness

307
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:14,360
so the question is can we really reproduce it and is it really you if you reproduce your

308
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,520
bits and this is where we overlap with philosophy and religion.

309
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,040
A lot of guys who talk about the simulation hypothesis, they don't like to talk about

310
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,680
religion, they'll talk about philosophy, they'll take it that far but they won't

311
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,680
take it but if you think particularly in the Eastern religions, you don't even have to

312
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:34,480
draw an analogy, they basically say that you have a soul or something that exists outside,

313
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,880
you download into your avatar which is our biological avatars in this case and then at

314
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,400
the end of the life, you upload back to wherever it was and there's some information from

315
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,760
this lifetime that is stored and then you go to the next lifetime, you're playing

316
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:53,880
the next avatar so you have this kind of upload and download of consciousness.

317
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,420
They don't even define what that is and there's actually one of the interesting differences

318
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:03,200
between say Hinduism and Buddhism is within Hinduism, you have more of an indestructible

319
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,600
soul which is a term we're more familiar with in the West because the Western religions

320
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:14,280
also have this idea of a soul that exists in eternity after you die somewhere else but

321
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,960
in the Buddhist traditions, particularly what some Buddhist scholars say is that it's more

322
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,000
like a bag of karma.

323
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,380
The only thing that gets uploaded and downloaded is the information about what happened to

324
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,600
you in that life and previous lives and in Silicon Valley, we would say that's just

325
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,880
storing stuff to the cloud, it's just a bag of information that gets stored somewhere

326
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,760
out of sight that is not part of the rendered game world as we call it in the video game

327
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,760
world.

328
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,640
But yeah, we're touching on very big issues when you get to that point.

329
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,400
Well, it seems like it's inevitable to talk about religions and philosophy and we're

330
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,240
reaching a point that everything is kind of coming together and we have to address all

331
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:00,340
of them and get any kind of information, any kind of a tool we can from wherever to make

332
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:04,080
sense out of basically what we are doing.

333
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:10,840
That's part of my point in this book and one of the criticisms I often get is why did

334
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,800
you dedicate a third of the book to talking about consciousness and religion and unexplained

335
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,080
phenomena when you should just talk about the computer science and the physics.

336
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:24,960
For me, it was actually important to realize that as you go back, humans have been searching

337
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:31,280
for the truth about reality for a very long time and you go back to the Greeks and Plato

338
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:38,040
had his analogy of the cave which is very popular in philosophy which is the idea that

339
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:42,120
if we all live in a cave chained to one side and there's an opening but we can't really

340
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:47,460
look out into the real world, all we see are shadows against the wall and what happens

341
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,560
when somebody goes outside and peeks to see what's out there.

342
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,480
Well, first he gets blinded by the light because he's lived in a cave his whole life but then

343
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,560
when he comes back and tries to explain it to the other people, nobody believes him because

344
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:05,720
they think reality is just these shadows that you're seeing on the wall and within I think

345
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,560
the Greek traditions, philosophy, science and religion were not different.

346
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:15,200
Plato's talking about all these things, Aristotle and Pythagoras, they were exploring

347
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,960
the mysteries and so I actually think the goal of religion, the goal of philosophy and

348
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:26,340
the goal of science is the same which is to try to understand the nature of the reality

349
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:32,220
that we live in and I actually think that most religions are founded when somebody peeks

350
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:36,960
outside the simulation as I like to call it, they peek outside the game and then they come

351
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,060
back and they try to describe what they saw which is very difficult to do because the

352
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:46,600
base reality as it's called may be very different than what we're used to here.

353
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:53,620
The laws of physics really could be just the physics engine of our specific game as opposed

354
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:57,680
to being the same out there so it's very difficult to talk about what base reality

355
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:03,240
is like and that is what creates the three blind men and the elephant phenomenon I like

356
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,360
to say with religion where each one saw a different part of the elephant, they're

357
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,800
actually seeing the same thing but they like to come back and tell it so that one says

358
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,840
it's more like a tree, one says it's more like a house, one says it's more like a snake

359
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:23,200
because of the trunk of the elephant and that's a phenomenon that we see in our religions.

360
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,000
I think it's very profound what you're saying that even the laws of physics could be just

361
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,840
limited to our experience which I keep telling people, I call them involuntary baggage that

362
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:39,160
you identify with your culture and your religion and what your parents have told you, what

363
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:46,400
your society have put upon your shoulder but really the point is to look at the definition

364
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:53,760
of who the I is, who are you beyond all of those things because these are the things

365
00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:00,080
that they have defined you on that basis, it's not you.

366
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,920
I think for a lot of younger people, this idea of the video game is a great way to think

367
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:12,360
about that question because if you were an avatar in Fortnite, who does that avatar think

368
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:17,200
he or she is?

369
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,600
What are the laws of physics in that game?

370
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,640
You can fly, you can do this, you can do that but you don't really have to go get a car

371
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:32,460
to go places so there's a set of laws and so that becomes in this model another set

372
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:38,780
of baggage but by having this idea of saying that there's a player and a player character,

373
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:44,780
it becomes a new way to think about it and within the world of the simulation hypothesis

374
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:50,400
and simulation theory, there's actually two different versions of this hypothesis and

375
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:56,160
I like to call it the NPC version and the RPG version and the NPC version stands for

376
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:01,080
non-player character or non-playable characters which is the term used in video games for

377
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:06,240
a character that is just an AI that you just interact with inside the game so you might

378
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:13,480
have like the tavern barkeep or the owner of a bank where you're giving some information

379
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,640
and so NPCs have gotten more and more sophisticated visually with games over time but if you go

380
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:24,160
all the way back to the text adventure games, there might be very limited characters, there's

381
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,160
characters you can ask very limited things to and they have a limited dialogue and even

382
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:33,600
nowadays a lot of the dialogue is you still have to just click on choose A or B. If you

383
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,520
go to like the Game of Thrones or Walking Dead games from Telltale, the guy will say

384
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:42,800
this and you have to choose your response A or B so it's still pretty basic but in

385
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:48,040
the NPC version, we're all NPCs and we're all running on somebody else's computer

386
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:52,280
and therefore the world around us is the only world we know.

387
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:57,800
In the RPG version, it's more like what we think of as video games where we have a player

388
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:02,600
and we have an avatar inside the game and we are so associated with that avatar like

389
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:07,000
in The Matrix, we forget that there's a part of us outside the world.

390
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,120
Now those two are not mutually exclusive like when you go into video games today like MMORPGs,

391
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:19,280
you have both, you have PCs, player characters and NPCs interacting and so it's very possible

392
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:24,960
that you have a combination of the two but for me, both of these versions creates this

393
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,840
interesting question of what is consciousness.

394
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:34,120
In the NPC version, consciousness is just what the NPC thinks they're doing whereas

395
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,440
in the RPG version, consciousness exists outside of the simulation.

396
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,400
You still don't know what it is but it's something different.

397
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,800
It's observing what's happening within the game and watching the gameplay.

398
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,640
I think one of the disconnects for a lot of people about the simulation hypothesis or

399
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,680
theory and however they want to talk about it is that, well, who's running the simulation

400
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,800
and the idea is that nobody really needs to run it.

401
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:02,160
If you look at, I'm reading from Wikipedia also showing it to our viewers, The Game of

402
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:08,400
Life by John Conway that it's a zero player game meaning that its evolution is determined

403
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,840
by its initial state requiring no further input.

404
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,560
All you have to do is start basically and it evolves in the way that it's supposed

405
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:21,420
to evolve and it's completely based on trial and error and chaos and uncertainty and momentary

406
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,040
orders out of them.

407
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:29,360
Right, and then it evolves based on a certain set of rules and in that case, they tend to

408
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:36,880
be very deterministic rules but it's a big question who runs the simulation and why.

409
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,200
Your question of do you really need somebody to run it or do you really need our set of

410
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,320
initial conditions and a way to get going.

411
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:47,680
One of the ways to think about it is why do we run simulations?

412
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:54,480
We run simulations sometimes to predict the weather or to predict stock forecasts or the

413
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,960
basic idea of a simulation is you have like populations of fruit flies.

414
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,000
Every year, you look at it and you say how many fruit flies have died and how many were

415
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,520
born in the next generation and that's a very non-graphical simulation, it's just

416
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,920
a numerical one but that's one reason.

417
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,720
The other reason though is we play video games, why?

418
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:18,160
We play video games to have experiences that we can't have outside the game.

419
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:24,640
I can't fly on a dragon in quote unquote real life but I can inside a video game so

420
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:30,240
I can have these experiences that I might not be able to have otherwise.

421
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:35,580
If you think of an MMORPG, a massively multiplayer online role playing game where you have lots

422
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:39,820
of individual people playing the game like Fortnite or World of Warcraft or one of these

423
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:45,200
other ones, you have millions of people, there was a concert in Fortnite last year that had

424
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,560
like 12 million people attending it.

425
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:54,840
It's like the largest concert ever and so it's possible that we are playing the game

426
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,920
for our own reasons to have experiences with each other or it's possible that we were

427
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,560
all just running on a computer somewhere and there's a set of deterministic rules and

428
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:10,960
those tie right into that dichotomy of the NPC version or the RPG version that I talked

429
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,960
about earlier.

430
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,960
That's amazing.

431
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,600
That's also how I like to think about the concept of God, quote unquote God, that there

432
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,080
is one thing whether conscious and it's an endless stream that has always been and always

433
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:28,400
will be and we are having our subjective experiences of it and the collection, decentralized collection

434
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:34,240
of that is what I can think of as the concept God or being higher power or whatever which

435
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,960
is unknowable and that's the nature of it.

436
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,840
We're just experiencing our own part of it.

437
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,840
Right.

438
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:46,640
So that's an interesting way to think about it.

439
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:52,840
Within the kind of Judeo-Christian line, you have this idea in the Bible that God created

440
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:59,140
the world in seven days and said let there be light and then basically gave humans free

441
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:06,120
will to decide what they were going to do and that there are entities outside the physical

442
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:10,720
world watching us and in the Islamic traditions, they get very specific about this.

443
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:17,000
There's names for the recording angels and in Washington DC, there's a statue of a recording

444
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,280
angel with what they call the Book of Life in the Bible and in the Quran, they talk about

445
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:29,280
the scroll of deeds which is a list of every single action you've done in your life and

446
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:35,400
so I like to draw the analogy that well, this was all revealed, written depending on your

447
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:40,440
beliefs a couple of thousand years ago and if it was done today, we wouldn't use a

448
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,360
metaphor of the book and writing down.

449
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:50,320
How would we describe a situation where there are entities watching every move we make and

450
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,480
then they replay it for us at the end of our life where we have to go back and review everything

451
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,480
that was done?

452
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,920
Well, we do it all the time in video games.

453
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:04,520
We record everything in the 3D world so that it can be replayed and we stream it on Twitch

454
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:09,720
and we put it up on YouTube and so I was involved in a video game company a couple of years

455
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:15,120
ago where we took a 3D game called League of Legends which is very popular in the e-sports

456
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:19,320
world and you play the game on your computer and you have an avatar and you're fighting

457
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:24,440
and you're doing all these fun things and they recorded it but then they let you replay

458
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:31,040
it by putting on a virtual reality headset and if you had shot someone, you could actually

459
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:37,280
replay it from their point of view so you could see the gameplay from any XYZ coordinate

460
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,160
but most interesting was to put the coordinates at other players.

461
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,160
Well it turns out as you explore this world of consciousness and you explore what people

462
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,280
have been talking about in the religious traditions but more recently in near-death experiences

463
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:57,040
and there have been thousands and thousands of cases of near-death experiences since Raymond

464
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:03,120
Moody coined the term back in the 70s and they're remarkably similar and many of them

465
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:12,160
have about some percentage have this thing called a panoramic life review which is basically

466
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:17,520
they recall seeing everything that happened in their lives but seeing it from the point

467
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,080
of view of the other people they affected and so there's a friend of mine named Daniel

468
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,760
Brinkley, he wrote a book called Saved by the Light and he was basically struck by lightning

469
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:31,040
and had a near-death experience back in the 70s and he's had several since then when

470
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,240
he was doing heart surgery etc.

471
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:37,040
But he said he used to be a bully and he used to literally beat people up in school and

472
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,040
then he joined the army and special forces and was literally shooting people.

473
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:49,880
He had to go through and relive those experiences from the point of view of the other person.

474
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:54,680
If you think about how could that work and that's kind of how I like to think about

475
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:59,640
things being a computer programmer is how would that work?

476
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,400
Well, it wouldn't be that hard if it was a simulation.

477
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,520
If it wasn't a simulation, nobody would know how it could be done but if this world

478
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:13,280
was being recorded and you could replay back any time slice at any time at any speed from

479
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:20,360
any position, then that's where the simulation hypothesis intersects very much with what

480
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:26,200
a lot of the religions have been saying and with this idea of angels being these other

481
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,420
entities that are watching us and then God being the creator of the simulation however

482
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,680
you would define it.

483
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,880
So there's a lot of different ways to think about that concept I think.

484
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:43,200
I think this is a good place to read a tweet by Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert said

485
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,000
the closer a civilization gets to being able to program a simulated universe, the closer

486
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,720
it gets to discovering it is one.

487
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,720
Right.

488
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:57,080
Well, he's a big proponent of the simulation hypothesis and there was an Oxford professor

489
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:03,680
named Nick Bostrom who wrote a paper in 2003 called Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?

490
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,600
He's probably the person most responsible for getting this to go from science fiction

491
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,800
to academics talking about it more seriously.

492
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:19,320
He's a philosopher and what he said was if any civilization ever gets there, he said

493
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,640
first of all there are three possibilities.

494
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,720
Civilization never gets to what I call the simulation point where you can create those

495
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,720
simulations.

496
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,840
Two, it gets there but it decides not to create these ultra realistic simulations or three,

497
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:36,880
it creates these simulations but it creates lots of them and so he said if any civilization

498
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,920
in the galaxy ever gets there, they're going to create lots and lots of simulations because

499
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:53,480
all you have to do is crank up another server in the cloud and he estimated that the number

500
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:58,920
of beings that would be in the simulated universes would be way more than the number of beings

501
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:05,200
in the physical universe and therefore if you're a being, then what are you more likely,

502
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,040
a simulated being or a physical being?

503
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,740
Well, there's more of these than those so simple statistics says you're more likely

504
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:16,200
one of these than one of those and so the idea was if anybody can ever get there, then

505
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,200
somebody has already gotten there and if somebody has already gotten there, who's to say we're

506
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:28,600
not inside the simulation already and so that is referred to as the simulation argument.

507
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,600
So when I started writing my book, I was exploring the technology, we would need to get there

508
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:40,360
and my conclusion was we'll get there within a hundred years maybe, definitely and so if

509
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:46,160
we're going to get there in a hundred years, that's not very long in the overall scale

510
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,000
of the universe assuming it was a physical universe so probably a civilization that was

511
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,640
a million years ahead of us so think of where video games would be in a million years and

512
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:01,640
this is a point that Elon Musk makes is that if you assume any rate of improvement at all

513
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:06,880
with video games and you look at today's games, it's funny because I use ping pong

514
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,600
as my example that got me really thinking about this but he makes the point that pong

515
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,400
was the first widely available computer game in the 70s which was just like two squares

516
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,040
and a dot moving back and forth and it was from Atari, it was the first widely available

517
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:29,120
video game and you look at where we've come in 50 years, we're at these ultra realistic

518
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:34,840
virtual worlds like even with this new version of flight simulator I was talking about and

519
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:39,800
give it another 50 years where will we be but give it 10,000 years suppose it goes more

520
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:45,240
slowly than that, we'll definitely get there and so if we're going to get there, who's

521
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,760
to say we aren't already there inside the simulation ourselves.

522
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:53,080
Absolutely, so your time frame is 100 years and you said there are 10 steps to get to

523
00:42:53,080 --> 00:43:01,560
the point of indistinguishable simulation, you mentioned AI, what number of step would

524
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,560
that be?

525
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:08,680
Well, it depends on where the AI is but in my model, it's one of the later steps because

526
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:15,880
I think getting to AGI will take us a little while so it's like step nine, eight or nine.

527
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:21,880
Before that, we're currently at sort of step four where we have augmented reality and virtual

528
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,880
reality.

529
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,480
Now, the difference between those two with augmented reality is you wear glasses and

530
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,720
you see objects around you placed in the physical world that aren't really there and there's

531
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:38,360
a great depiction of this in the HBO show Westworld in the second season where they

532
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,840
would put on these little glasses and then somebody will appear who's not really there

533
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,320
and you can talk to them.

534
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:49,200
Then the next step is kind of photorealistic AR, VR without headsets.

535
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:55,720
If you think of like in Star Wars in the prequels when Anakin Skywalker is talking to Master

536
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:01,240
Yoda who's on another planet, he sees a little hologram or Princess Leia hologram.

537
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:06,080
The ability to create these holograms and have them be realistic without the need to

538
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:11,320
put on glasses means that we're starting to blur the lines of distinction between what

539
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,320
is a physicality.

540
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:18,480
We're already at the point of hologram though with, do you know Hatsune Miku, the virtual

541
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,680
Japanese pop singer?

542
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,760
Yes, that's right.

543
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,640
I have heard of some of them.

544
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,320
You had the Tupac, was it the Tupac hologram as well?

545
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,320
Right.

546
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,160
So Hatsune Miku, entirely virtual.

547
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,660
Her band are all human but even her voice is virtually generated and we went to see

548
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:43,960
her show in Toronto and people are interacting with it as if it's a real artist and they

549
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,520
are very happy to be there.

550
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,760
They have the very same experience and we were given glow sticks that was programmed

551
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,760
with the light.

552
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,760
It's just insane.

553
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,760
Right.

554
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,760
So this will just become more mainstream, you were saying.

555
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:02,200
Yeah, become more mainstream and the technology is miniaturized where you can do that.

556
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,240
You can take it with you if you will, right?

557
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,500
But yeah, we're on that path.

558
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:09,600
Each of these stages isn't like a single, hey, we're there or we're not there.

559
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:13,760
It's more like each of them has a certain percentage of completion if you will to get

560
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:20,400
to that point and with 3D printers are kind of part of that same idea which is that we

561
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,760
can take pretty much any physical object now.

562
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:29,520
You could take this water bottle and you can print it using pixels and the only thing that's

563
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:34,080
different is that we don't have all of the materials yet to be able to use pixels but

564
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:42,280
it used to be every 3D printed object was this kind of gray plastic epoxy and now you

565
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:46,280
can start to do it with metal and with living human tissue.

566
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:54,320
I mean they've actually taken blood cells and created skin like what happened with skin

567
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:59,480
that was grafted on before was it wouldn't interface with the rest of your skin because

568
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:04,000
it wasn't really alive in the same way that your skin is alive because it has blood cells

569
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:11,600
in there and so they were able to print skin at least in the lab and graft it on and have

570
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,960
the rest of the body think it was just like a regular skin with the same kind of blood

571
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:22,920
cells using that person's own cells and printing up the skin and so you're getting biological

572
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,920
3D printers.

573
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:29,760
Now, they're still in the early stages but once you can do printing of different materials,

574
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,700
there's a pretty common scene in the old Star Trek The Next Generation where Captain

575
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:40,520
Picard goes into the replicator and says, �Tea, Earl Grey, hot� and it not only

576
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:46,360
materializes the cup but it materializes the Earl Grey liquid inside and then he takes

577
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:52,920
that and he starts drinking it and so that's kind of an advanced 3D printer that can print

578
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,720
food as well as physical objects.

579
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,260
We're not that far away from that.

580
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:04,760
So what we don't have is these brain-computer interfaces and so that's like stage 7 before

581
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:09,400
getting to AI and then downloadable consciousness and so brain-computer interface, if you remember

582
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:15,760
the Matrix, Neo thought he was immersed because when he woke up, Keanu Reeves' character

583
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:22,560
outside the Matrix, he had a wire going into the back of his head into his Neo cortex and

584
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:26,600
so that's actually an area that's pretty popular these days.

585
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:32,120
Elon Musk has a company called Neuralink which is putting some chips in the head and there

586
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:37,960
are other groups that have done research where these chips can be used to help with deficiency

587
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:47,560
or if someone is paralyzed but BCIs are still in the early stages and much of them are non-invasive.

588
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:52,860
What they do is they just measure the EEG signals coming out of the brain and they use

589
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:57,520
those brain waves along with other cues like muscle impulses.

590
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:02,240
There's a company that I wrote about recently, an article about BCI where they want to speed

591
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,720
up your ability to play video games and so from the time it takes you to say I want to

592
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:10,360
shoot this person to pressing the button on the controller, it takes a couple hundred

593
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:16,840
milliseconds and so they detect the electrical impulse in the muscles and they go and they

594
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:21,720
do it in the game much faster than you could on your own and so there's a lot of tricks

595
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,680
like that that are being used today in BCI.

596
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:30,520
I actually think this is where this idea of what is the mind, what is the brain, what

597
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:34,840
is consciousness really comes up.

598
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:40,840
There's actually been some experiments done at Pair, the Princeton's Engineering Anomalies

599
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:46,840
Research Institute where they showed they were using quantum random number generators

600
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:51,920
and the idea is that over time, they should be 50-50 if it was just doing ones and zeros

601
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:58,720
or coin toss right after a thousand tries or 10,000 tries and they found that a human

602
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:04,800
could influence those quantum random number generators based upon what they were thinking.

603
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,800
That's a form of observation, right?

604
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,920
It's a form of observation or measurement, better to say.

605
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,720
Measurement but they found that if a person sat there with an intention, it would actually

606
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,720
change.

607
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,360
The measurement didn't happen necessarily until later so there's the measurement side

608
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:25,520
of it but leaving that aside for a second, they found that when they measured it, depending

609
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:32,560
on what the person was thinking, that it would go from 50-50 to like 40-60 which is actually

610
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,840
a pretty big variance when you get to 10,000 tries.

611
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:39,760
When you're doing 10 tries, that's not a big deal at all but when you flip a coin that

612
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:46,560
many times, it shouldn't vary that much and they had Pair published peer-reviewed research

613
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:52,400
in that and there was a company, they made something called a mind lamp where you can

614
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,840
actually think of a color that they're using quantum random number generators.

615
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:02,400
Now that's a way to try to get that brain-computer interface without actually physically tapping

616
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,000
into the physical brain.

617
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,520
I was talking to somebody the other day and they said, well, that would be a mind-computer

618
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:15,640
interface as opposed to a brain-computer interface so that's all part of this big stage and

619
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:21,360
I think to get fully immersive, we would have to be able to beam signals into the brain

620
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:26,920
and then take signals out of the brain and then there's AI which would be realistic

621
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:32,120
characters and then there's this idea of downloading consciousness which is kind of

622
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:36,040
wrapping up our whole consciousness within that and then we get to the simulation point

623
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:41,400
and so when I laid these stages of technology out there, I thought about my other research

624
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,160
into the realm of consciousness and realized, well, we already have all of these stages

625
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:52,280
of technology in biological form and we do it every night, they're called dreams.

626
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:57,160
We have these simulated worlds, we're completely immersed in them, we're forgetting that

627
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:03,240
there's a part of us outside of that world that is kind of like Neo laying there.

628
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:08,520
We take our input from our mind and the world changes based on that input.

629
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:13,000
We get things sent to us in very high resolution, it's fully immersive.

630
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:19,520
So what we're really learning to do is reproduce this biological technology that already exists.

631
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:23,260
So I thought that was kind of an interesting realization when I looked at the technology

632
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:29,160
but yeah, back to your original point, I think a hundred years or so is roughly the time

633
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,160
frame.

634
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,160
Some people think it will be much earlier.

635
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:36,760
I think that the AGI in particular part will prove more difficult than people think.

636
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:42,320
Hey, speaking of already existed biological technology, did you look into the effect or

637
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:46,760
influence of psychedelics in the context of simulation hypothesis?

638
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:53,200
A lot of people have brought that up to me to say that this is a great way for people

639
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,200
to explore it.

640
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:58,280
I haven't personally explored it but there have been people that have written about it.

641
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,600
There's a couple of things online about it.

642
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:09,360
I remember I was sitting down with director Oliver Stone with his son, Sean Stone, who

643
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:14,280
is a documentary filmmaker and he goes, �Oh yeah, all you have to do is try some of these

644
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,880
psychedelics and you'll realize that this is all just a simulation.�

645
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:17,880
Smoke DMT.

646
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:25,120
Yeah, DMT, exactly, ayahuasca and you'll see you don't need any further proof than that.

647
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:28,960
So I haven't experimented with that but I have heard a lot of people tell me that the

648
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:34,520
experiences they've had there seem like you get into these other levels of reality and

649
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:39,560
so there's obviously a lot of debate about these things in the scientific community.

650
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,840
What's really going on?

651
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,680
Same debate as with near-death experiences, what's really going on?

652
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:49,920
Is it just the oxygen in the brain, seeing something that looks like a light but there's

653
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,200
lots of counter-arguments there.

654
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:57,080
So I actually put some stock that this is something that shamans have done for a long

655
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:02,560
time in many traditions and they have what they call non-ordinary reality that they visit

656
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:08,560
with the use of psychotropic plants or power plants as they're called.

657
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:15,200
In some cases, what I have experimented with is simple shamanic journeying using drumming.

658
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:20,600
What happens is you use a rhythmic beat and meanwhile your breathing stabilizes and you

659
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:25,160
can kind of visit these other worlds which is the technique that shamans have been using

660
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,160
for a long time.

661
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:32,120
What's really interesting, getting back to this idea of dreams, you might say well

662
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:36,720
these are just individual hallucinations is you can have group shamanic journeys so you

663
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:42,360
can have multiple people go and see things and report back and you can see commonalities

664
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:47,600
between what different people saw which leads you to believe that there is a reality to

665
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,640
this non-ordinary reality.

666
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:55,840
So are there other levels of this reality out there which is perhaps similar to what

667
00:53:55,840 --> 00:54:01,320
people might experience although much more intensely I think with DMT?

668
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:09,000
My first experience with NNDMT, not the 5-Emeo that comes from the Toad, but NNDMT, I saw

669
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,400
massive pyramids and Aztec kind of symbology.

670
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:18,600
The days later I was like these people probably had the similar kind of experience that you

671
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:25,000
see similar kind of shape buildings from Australia to Egypt to Peru and Mexico and we're not

672
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,360
even talking about any of them, you're all aliens.

673
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,120
Right, that's true.

674
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:38,000
There's a lot of alien phenomena theorizing particularly on the history channel about

675
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,600
these things but I do believe that a lot of ancient civilizations had much better understanding

676
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:52,160
of consciousness and that might have led to different states of consciousness.

677
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:59,240
My girlfriend and I visited the pyramids many years ago and when I was there, I remember

678
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:05,200
having these visions that included things like out-of-body experiences in places like

679
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:10,560
the pyramids and it kind of led me to believe that there's something going on here that

680
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:18,160
I was either remembering that was related to research that I had done later after that

681
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:22,080
on out-of-body experiences and lucid dreaming and what happens when you're dreaming.

682
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,600
That's why I find dreaming to be such a fascinating subject.

683
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:30,200
It's probably one of the oldest subjects for people to write about and going back to

684
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:34,360
the Bible because it's so universal but it's also so complicated.

685
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:39,440
I mean I've talked about shamanic journeying, I used to study that with a gentleman named

686
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:44,920
Robert Moss who is an Australian who studied with Aborigines and learned about their ideas

687
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:50,120
of the dream time and how there's a dream reality and then there's this reality and

688
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:55,760
what is the real reality and so this metaphor of the dream was used within Buddhism and

689
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:01,520
other places and I studied a little bit of Tibetan dream yoga and the idea was if you

690
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:05,680
can wake up within a dream using lucid dreaming techniques and they have other techniques

691
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,640
beyond what we would call lucid dreaming which is the more modern way of talking about it

692
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:13,640
but if you can wake up and know that it's a dream and know that there's a part of you

693
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:19,440
outside the dream, then they use that as a wrench if you will or a lever to kind of get

694
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:24,560
you to realize the illusory form of the waking reality that there is another part of you

695
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:29,640
that's outside of that and so that's why I spend a whole chapter talking about dreams

696
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:36,800
not just as a metaphor which is very much how it's used that life is like a dream

697
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:43,280
or the play, in the Hindu traditions there's the lila, the grand play which is a metaphor

698
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:48,480
that Shakespeare used talking about how life is a stage and the men and women are merely

699
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:54,120
players on it but I like to think that if these things were written about today we would

700
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:59,800
say life is an interactive video game and we're all avatars within the game.

701
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,920
That would be the metaphor that we would use because it's one that makes a little more

702
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:08,880
sense and can bridge the gap between science, technology and a lot of these spiritual traditions.

703
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:13,720
Wow, well this book everybody should go and buy it, it's called The Simulation Hypothesis

704
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:19,520
and MIT Computer Scientist shows why AI, Quantum Physics and Eastern Mystics all agree we are

705
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,080
in a video game.

706
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:27,440
Before we wrap this up, I don't want to keep you too long but I can go on for hours

707
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,800
man, this is amazing.

708
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:37,640
The intersection of consciousness, technology and philosophy is a very interesting area

709
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:42,840
and a lot of people are very dismissive of it but I think that is exactly the point.

710
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:51,280
It makes people think in ways that they wouldn't otherwise and I think that's why a lot of

711
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,040
people are talking about it today but I also think there's a lot of people who normally

712
00:57:54,040 --> 00:58:01,800
do not want to talk about philosophy or the nature of reality that this is a way in for

713
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,520
them to talk about these things.

714
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,520
Absolutely.

715
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:08,800
Let's also really quickly talk about your new book that came out in June I believe of

716
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:14,280
this year called Startup Myth and Models What You Won't Learn in Business School.

717
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,740
What is the summary of the book?

718
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:21,680
What is your thesis and what is the main message you want the readers to take away from it?

719
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:28,440
This book I wrote over the last 25 years of working as an entrepreneur, initially as a

720
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:34,240
founder and then as a board member and investor and then the subtitle of the book was supposed

721
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:38,780
to be What You Won't Learn at Stanford Business School but it was published by the

722
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:44,080
Columbia University Press so they said, well, we can't really take a pot shot at Stanford

723
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:49,240
but when I was at business school, what I found was that a lot of what they taught us

724
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:57,420
applied to mature industries and applied to public companies but it didn't always apply

725
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:03,500
to startups that startups needed a different set of models for thinking about how startup

726
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:05,000
markets evolved.

727
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,200
I remember in one of the classes, literally the guy who wrote the textbook on decision

728
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:13,440
modeling, it was a textbook on how to make extremely complicated Excel spreadsheets

729
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:18,840
and you would plug in all the numbers, scenario A, B, and C and then you would see the results

730
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:22,940
and you'd say, oh, this number is better than that number which is not as good as this

731
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:26,520
number so we're going to pick C and I remember raising my hand and saying, well, what if

732
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:30,160
you just change the numbers on the left, the inputs, he goes, well, then all the numbers

733
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:33,120
on the right change and I said, well, how do you know what numbers to put in?

734
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:38,640
He said, well, that's where you have to use your gut as a manager, that's why they pay

735
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:43,840
you the big bucks and turns out as an entrepreneur, spreadsheets are pretty meaningless because

736
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:49,200
there isn't any history now in big companies, the best bet of the future is the past.

737
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:54,140
You look at probabilities of what's happened in the past but the whole reason there is

738
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:58,440
a market for startups is because the past is not equal to future.

739
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:03,140
I grew up in Detroit, Michigan and one of my friends went to work for General Motors

740
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:07,800
and when the Toyota Prius came out as a hybrid car a few years ago and the Japanese companies

741
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:11,960
were coming out with hybrid cars quickly, I asked him, why hasn't GM released one

742
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:15,560
and he goes, well, we did the spreadsheets and it just didn't make financial sense

743
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:17,600
for us.

744
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:22,360
One of the main messages in the book is that the startup world is different than the traditional

745
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:27,240
finance world and that you have to follow a different set of rules and they're not

746
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:31,760
really rules, you can't systemize everything, everyone's like, I want to know if I do

747
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:39,000
A, B and C, 1, 2, 3, then I will have a successful startup and my degree at Stanford is in management

748
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,080
science but management is partly a science but it's partly an art, there's a lot

749
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:48,080
of interpersonal stuff that happens and I would say the same with startups.

750
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:53,200
You can teach you how to put together a deck, how to do a market sizing, how to put together

751
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:57,040
a business plan, how to build a product, how to be a product manager, how to measure results

752
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:02,800
but you can't guarantee that following any of those steps will lead to success so there

753
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:09,360
is a formless element and it's much more like an adventure so I use the idea from mythology

754
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:12,400
of Joseph Campbell's hero's journey.

755
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:17,240
He looked at all the myths of the world and found that many of them from the Odyssey to

756
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:23,200
Beowulf and even more recent ones like Lord of the Rings or Star Wars follow these stages

757
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:26,360
and turns out the entrepreneurial journey can be summarized in these stages where you

758
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:31,400
have a call to adventure, you might refuse the call, you cross the threshold and you

759
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:35,640
find yourself in the road of trials which is when you release the product and you realize

760
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:39,600
oh my God, things are not going like I thought they would and you have to get out there and

761
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:42,880
figure out how to get through these challenges that crop up along the way.

762
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:47,840
You have these archetypes like mentors and gatekeepers just like in the old stories,

763
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:53,960
these colorful characters, it's like a video game in a way and then you often have a trip

764
01:01:53,960 --> 01:02:00,400
to the underworld, I mean Odysseus literally went down to Hades in the Lord of the Rings,

765
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,240
they went to the mines of Moria in entrepreneurship.

766
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:08,760
Often there's a life or death, not necessarily your physical life or death but life or death

767
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:12,760
of the company and so the book is laid out in the stages of the hero's journey to then

768
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:17,060
find the treasure which you might think of means selling your company for a lot of money

769
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:21,920
or going public but really the treasure is as Joseph Campbell would call it, a magic

770
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:27,240
elixir that you can take back into the normal everyday world and so it's really about how

771
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:32,200
this journey changes you as a person and how you make decisions along the way.

772
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:35,840
That's kind of a long summary of what this book is about.

773
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:36,840
That's amazing.

774
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:41,760
It reminded me of something I think Naval Ravikant was talking about that even if you

775
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:46,200
talk to successful people how they did it, they can't really tell you or the honest

776
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:49,360
ones are not like I don't know.

777
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:53,680
That's right, the honest ones will tell you that there's a lot more luck involved than

778
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:57,920
just follow steps one, two or three and luck may not be the right word.

779
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:03,880
I think it ties very much to the situation and the personality of the person in that

780
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:08,640
situation so there's the internal and the external side of these things and then those

781
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:14,960
have to align and when they do that maybe leads to more financial success but in either

782
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:19,680
way you will learn a lot about yourself on the entrepreneurial journey.

783
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:25,080
Well, Riz, we definitely have optimized many years worth of knowledge in this almost an

784
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:30,520
hour, a little more than an hour conversation, really appreciate it.

785
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:34,200
What's next for you and where our audience can follow your work?

786
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:40,640
Sure, so they can go to my website which is zenentrepreneur.com or follow me on Twitter

787
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:46,800
at Riz Stanford and I'm working on some additional books right now in the early days

788
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:53,240
and still doing technology investing and helping entrepreneurs get their game companies and

789
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:59,600
virtual reality companies off the ground and at some point I may try to establish an institute

790
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:04,160
doing research on all of these different stages that I talked about for the simulation point

791
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:09,320
to be a focal point for bringing all this stuff together but that's probably in the

792
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:10,320
long term.

793
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:14,080
Yeah, so you're still investing in startups and people can pitch to you.

794
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:18,840
Yeah, so I'm a venture partner at a couple of venture funds, one's called Griffin Gaming

795
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:22,840
Partners and one's called Ridge Ventures, one does enterprise software and one does

796
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:28,180
more video games and so you can connect with me on LinkedIn or go to my website and contact

797
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:30,240
me there as well at zenentrepreneur.com.

798
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,760
Okay, amazing.

799
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:37,080
Let me ask you the last question that now it has a different meaning to me because you'll

800
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:42,440
know why, I ask all my guests that if you come across an intelligent alien from a different

801
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:46,560
civilization, what would you say is the worst thing humanity has done and what would you

802
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,960
say is a greatest achievement?

803
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:55,400
But now I'm thinking how do we know who those aliens are in this simulation hypothesis?

804
01:04:55,400 --> 01:05:00,920
Right, I mean I'll answer it using superheroes.

805
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:05,780
What happened in the 19th century is we got a much better understanding of the physical

806
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:09,200
universe and there are stars and there are planets.

807
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:15,140
So what's happened is a lot of the superheroes in the 20th century were like supermen from

808
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:16,680
the planet Krypton, right?

809
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:21,080
So they're from out there and they come here and they have different powers.

810
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:27,800
If you look at superheroes today, like when my nephews, they watched The Flash on TV,

811
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:30,240
they have parallel universes.

812
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:34,720
Supergirl is in her own parallel universe and you have Earth 1, Earth 2 or 3.

813
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:39,760
So just now, this idea of parallel universes and multiple timelines is starting to creep

814
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:46,600
into the popular consciousness and so this idea of aliens, it may almost be a 20th century

815
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:51,720
idea that in fact, if they showed up, it could be that they're piercing through from a different

816
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:54,800
level of reality.

817
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:59,600
So it's possible that those people out there who say they've seen UFOs and aliens and

818
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:04,280
those people who say the Fermi paradox is true and we have no sign of aliens, both could

819
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:08,920
be right in the sense that they're not actually physical aliens coming from other planets.

820
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:12,360
They're actually piercing through from another level of reality.

821
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:17,240
So my guess is they've already been watching us to a certain extent.

822
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:22,560
So what would you say is the worst thing humanity has done and what is our greatest achievement?

823
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:25,560
That's a good question.

824
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:31,440
The worst and the best are probably both represented by the world's religions, right?

825
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:35,280
I feel like they have brought out the best of humanity in trying to understand and how

826
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:39,560
we treat others but they've also brought out the worst of humanity in religious wars

827
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:44,160
and bigotry and in wanting to conquer each other.

828
01:06:44,160 --> 01:07:13,000
So I guess I'd give the same answer for both.
