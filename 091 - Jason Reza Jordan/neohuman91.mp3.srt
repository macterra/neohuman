1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Man is a tightrope between ape and overman.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,960
A tightrope is not somewhere you want to stay, okay?

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,020
It is not a stable place.

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:23,640
There is no human nature that defines the limits of what we can be in the way that various

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,880
animals have a species being that they can't do anything about.

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,020
As you put it earlier in our conversation, the quote unquote nature of man is inextricable

7
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,260
from technology and technological development.

8
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,140
Technology made us.

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,720
We were technological before we were human.

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:49,240
The use of technology by primates is what created the human being.

11
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:59,360
Dr. Georgiani, welcome back to Neohuman Podcast, less than a year ago, but few episodes apart

12
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,480
because I haven't done too many of these podcasts.

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,480
Welcome.

14
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,920
It's a pleasure to be with you again, Agha.

15
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,920
Yeah, absolutely.

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,920
How have you been?

17
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,600
I believe you're back in New York, New York City, which for the reasons that maybe we

18
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,800
get to it, I consider it to be the capital of woke at this point or whatever that is

19
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,640
going on philosophically and spiritually on the other side.

20
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,640
How have you been?

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,320
How are you dealing with all these limitations and restrictions and everything that's been

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,920
happening since the last time that we spoke?

23
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:39,160
Well, it's hard and it affects me deeply.

24
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,280
The weather is still nice here, so in terms of restaurants, I can sit outside and not

25
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,680
have to submit to the vaccine mandate, but that's not the issue.

26
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,800
What's the issue is that I see the city that I grew up in and that I love being totally

27
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:01,480
destroyed, having its character completely deformed.

28
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,720
This is not the spirit of New York.

29
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:12,020
New York was the toughest, grittiest city in the country, if not the world.

30
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:18,920
To see this kind of cowering and fearfulness, I mean, I don't know what happened to New

31
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,920
Yorkers.

32
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,820
I don't know who these people are that surround me right now.

33
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,360
But what I tell people when they say, you should move to the South or you should move

34
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,620
to Eastern Europe or whatever, is that I have the kind of relationship to this city that

35
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,400
Socrates had to Athens.

36
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,080
I will probably die here before I abandon my post.

37
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,160
So we'll see what happens.

38
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:50,840
But New York, to me, is a city like Babylon once was, like Rome was.

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,360
It's a city that may die many times but come back with a vengeance.

40
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:05,720
And I do think that our worst days are probably ahead of us, but that this city will rise

41
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,440
from out of the waters and from out of the waves and from out of the ashes.

42
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,160
And it will be a phoenix.

43
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,660
Yeah, I think it's important to consider because a lot of people are saying that these people

44
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:22,400
are incompetent, that anything that they touch turns into dust and trash.

45
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,800
But it's also, I think, important to consider that this could all be intentional as a matter

46
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,840
of treason that people who are pushing these cities to fall apart are doing it just so

47
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,200
they can buy the dip, basically.

48
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,360
Everything crashes and these people in New York, de Blasio and his people, just buying

49
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:47,620
up the city and creating this kind of centrally driven hub of whatever kind of a social experiment

50
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,960
that they want to force upon the people.

51
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,800
You know, I don't mean to say something so out there, so early in our conversation, but

52
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:05,760
I can't stop myself in response to the question or in response to what you just said.

53
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,860
I have known some of the top remote viewers, people who worked at the Stanford Research

54
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:18,840
Institute program that was funded by the CIA and then by the DOD to gather intelligence

55
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,720
using extrasensory perception.

56
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,920
And one of the things that these people would do is they would look at future events and

57
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:32,880
they did that for counterterrorism purposes and other objectives of the US government.

58
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:40,880
But sometimes they would just engage in remote viewing targets decades into the future, particularly

59
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,120
having to do with anticipating and preparing for natural catastrophes and so forth.

60
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:53,220
And one person that I spoke with at some length was the trainer for the entire CIA remote

61
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,840
viewing program.

62
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,200
And he and his group had actually remote viewed the year 2050.

63
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:05,000
And they had seen that all of the cities were emptied out and people were living on isolated

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,160
neo-agrarian homesteads in the countryside.

65
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,460
And when I asked him why this was the case, he said that they were terrified of disease

66
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:22,080
and they did not allow anyone other than their close friends and family onto their property.

67
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,680
And so the cities were still there.

68
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,040
It's not like there had been a nuclear war.

69
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,080
And in fact, he said that criminals lived in the cities because it was a place where

70
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,240
you could evade surveillance and control.

71
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,600
They were like squatting in the cities.

72
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,480
But the cities were otherwise emptied out.

73
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:46,920
And so I think that you're right that on even a much higher level or in a much more nefarious

74
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,080
way than you suggested, this is all being done very deliberately.

75
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:58,720
And New York City in particular is being targeted as sort of the beta test for this entire program

76
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,560
because New York City is potentially such a bastion of resistance against the kind of

77
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,200
world order that they want to bring.

78
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,360
I know a lot of people on the right don't see it that way, but I think they lack a long

79
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,840
view of history and they lack an understanding of the nuances of the character of the city.

80
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,440
This could become a bastion of mass resistance against the certain, this place could become

81
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,800
a bastion of mass resistance against the kind of totalitarian regime that they want to ultimately

82
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,120
unfold on a planetary scale.

83
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,320
And so I think that their first objective has to be to destroy cities like New York

84
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,520
and to isolate people as much as possible, to make it so that all of their communication

85
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:44,620
is through cyberspace, which is a medium that they control entirely, and make it harder

86
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,220
for people to gather en masse, you know, face to face.

87
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,560
So yes, I'm very concerned about that.

88
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,200
So let's stay on New York for a second.

89
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,840
I want to talk to you about your book, obviously, but I think this is very important and it

90
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,860
could be even related as you already make some kind of a connection.

91
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:06,320
This cancel culture that has been taking out statues and canceling people, they've replaced

92
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,840
all those things by one thing, as far as I know, and that is one statue that they put

93
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:18,520
in New York in the Rockefeller Center called, called the Oracle, which is this massive,

94
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:24,040
I don't know if it's still there, it's this massive black figure who's holding a flame.

95
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,840
And this is significant.

96
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,040
And I really wanted to talk to you about it for a month, because this is happening at

97
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,720
the same place that there was a statue of Prometheus that has been placed there, I would

98
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,480
assume for you as the founder of Prometheism.

99
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:44,200
This place should be a sacred place that I don't even know what kind of a term to use

100
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:50,080
violated or whatever, but I think this is extremely important to understand where these

101
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,940
people are coming from spiritually, philosophically.

102
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,800
And so please tell me what you think about that.

103
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,080
How do you see it and whether or not this statue is still there and what is the significance

104
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,880
of it all?

105
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:11,440
What they did is not some, you know, kitsch art industry gimmick.

106
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,760
This was done very deliberately and I'll explain to you why I know that's the case.

107
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:24,080
If you look at this monstrosity that they set up at the opening of, at the opening,

108
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,160
the mouth of Rockefeller Plaza, right, so that when you stand in front of this quote

109
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,120
unquote oracle, it blocks the view of the Prometheus statue and the entire plaza.

110
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,680
You can't see anything of what's behind it.

111
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:43,000
It towers in front of you, blocks that majestic architectural design and the sculpture of

112
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,320
Prometheus that the plaza leads down to.

113
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,520
Is it still there?

114
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,520
You know what?

115
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,120
To tell you the truth, I was so appalled that I haven't been back there since I really could

116
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,080
not bring myself to go back there, because as you said, to me, it's a sacred place.

117
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,000
And you know, if you notice the title of my first book, Prometheus and Atlas, it comes

118
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
from the fact that there's a statue of Prometheus and a statue of Atlas at Rockefeller Plaza.

119
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,520
And the opening paragraph of Prometheus and Atlas evokes that place as a kind of, you

120
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,520
know, navel of the world.

121
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,480
And so I have not been able to bring myself to go back there since.

122
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,240
Hopefully by the time I do, that will have been removed.

123
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:30,280
In any case, if you look at the symbolism of this statue, he has the torch of Prometheus

124
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,240
in his hand.

125
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:41,040
So this figure has stolen the fire back from Prometheus and this figure has an African

126
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,880
mask on, but it's actually Zeus.

127
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:55,040
Zeus enthroned, wearing an African mask, having stolen the fire back from Prometheus.

128
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:01,320
So what this statue actually means, and this is lost on the BLM ninis who are celebrating

129
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:08,000
it, is that Zeus, the tyrannical godfather, head of the caste system, head of the system

130
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,080
of slavery and oppression and, you know, racial hierarchy and so on and so forth, is using

131
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:25,480
a black mask to steal the fire of liberation back from us rebels in order to refound that

132
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:32,680
system of oppression and take his throne again, but this time wearing the mask of social justice.

133
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,800
That's what that sculpture actually means.

134
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,400
So it's not even a head because a lot of people were like deformed head, giant head.

135
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,400
It is a mask.

136
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:48,680
It's a traditional African mask on Zeus's face and the figure is Zeus on his throne.

137
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,240
The sculpture of Prometheus at Rockefeller Center is about Prometheus challenging the

138
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:59,760
throne of Zeus and stealing the fire of the light of scientific knowledge and the forge

139
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,800
of technological innovation, stealing that fire from Olympus and giving it as a gift

140
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,240
to mankind for the sake of human empowerment.

141
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,560
That's what the sculpture of Prometheus is about and in fact, there's a quote from Aeschylus

142
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,320
above that sculpture in Rockefeller Plaza that makes it very explicit, right?

143
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,240
Whereas this monstrosity they put there to block the view of the Prometheus statue is

144
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,840
about putting Zeus back on his throne again and making sure that the fire is taken from

145
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,680
us, all justified by an African mask.

146
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,160
Wow.

147
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,680
When you say they, who exactly are you referring to?

148
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:44,040
We're elites who are using Black Lives Matter as a vehicle in order to establish a system

149
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:51,900
where knowledge is secreted away and hidden from us again and where there's basically

150
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:59,960
a neo-agrarian feudal state put into place to keep masses obedient, submissive and ignorant.

151
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:05,640
Yes, centralized interests basically, which is global.

152
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,640
Hierarchical and centralized.

153
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,640
Right.

154
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,080
Hierarchical and centralized.

155
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,520
So I think this is a good pathway to get into your new book, Congratulations, by the way,

156
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:20,760
Closer Encounters that came out I believe in August and it's been a number one in a

157
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,320
variety of categories on Amazon.

158
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:29,400
I'm showing the hardcover page of Amazon but it's also available in paperback and audiobook

159
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,680
maybe it's also available?

160
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,680
Not yet.

161
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,680
Hopefully soon.

162
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,600
I'll get Artos working on that.

163
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:42,240
So let's talk about your intention for writing this book now and then we get to whether or

164
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,680
not there is some kind of a grand intention or grand plan and objective that is being

165
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:54,880
played on this planet and beyond this planet that it's all basically coming unmasked in

166
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,040
this period that we're experiencing.

167
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,040
Right.

168
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:05,200
So the prompt for my finally writing about this subject after having studied it for 20

169
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:11,240
years on the side of everything else that I've been doing was the UAP report, which

170
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:20,120
we knew from late last year that it was going to be released this summer and I correctly

171
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:27,320
anticipated that this report would be a monstrous lie.

172
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:38,640
And so I wanted to make sure to synthesize and crystallize my own interpretation and

173
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:45,180
reflections on close encounters and have it ready as a response to this deception that's

174
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,360
being promulgated.

175
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,520
This is a report about UFO that the US government released after a lot of anticipation and build

176
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,320
up basically.

177
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
That's right.

178
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,920
UAP preliminary assessment is what it was called.

179
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:07,620
And look, the mandate for this report, which came from Congress and was spearheaded by

180
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:16,720
people like Marco Rubio from the perspective of national security because our highest level

181
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:26,320
naval assets were being overflown on a regular basis by these unidentified vehicles.

182
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:35,680
The mandate of this report was that all intelligence that the Navy, the Air Force and whatever

183
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:42,720
other branch of the US government had on these quote unquote unidentified aerial phenomena

184
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:49,080
ought to be volunteered to Congress and an assessment should be made as to what these

185
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,720
phenomena are.

186
00:14:51,720 --> 00:15:03,140
And when we got the actual report, we saw that first of all, they limited the database

187
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:09,640
upon which they based their conclusions to a period starting from the early 2000s until

188
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,440
the present.

189
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:20,160
Secondly, although the mandate specifically instructed the Office of Naval Intelligence,

190
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,600
because most of these sightings recently have involved US aircraft carriers and other naval

191
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,680
vessels, specifically instructed Office of Naval Intelligence to hand over everything

192
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,400
it knew about UFOs.

193
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,840
None of that is acknowledged in this report.

194
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:43,520
The Office of Naval Intelligence has an archive going back 70 years, full of hundreds and

195
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:51,760
hundreds of UFO reports, including reports of what they call USOs, unidentified submersible

196
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,980
or submarine objects, which are UFOs that come up from out of the water or go back down

197
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,880
into the oceans.

198
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:04,160
And they've tracked these things going at incredible speeds on sonar from submarines.

199
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,320
They have hundreds of reports going back decades, and many of them have already been made public.

200
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:17,920
And yet, in this UAP report and this UAP preliminary assessment, they refuse to acknowledge any

201
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,920
of that.

202
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:24,120
It's as if this thing only started happening in the early 2000s.

203
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,560
And they make some brief mention of how, well, previously, we kind of noticed some things

204
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,480
that we didn't really have any good data yet.

205
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,480
Well, bullshit.

206
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,040
So, first of all, they're covering up 70 years of their own data.

207
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:43,360
Second, this report is a disaster from the standpoint of national security for the following

208
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,840
reason.

209
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:52,840
Up until now, it's been assumed since the Condon report, the concluded Project Bluebook

210
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:59,120
in 1969, where the University of Colorado came in and under the chairmanship of Professor

211
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,280
Condon did an assessment of the Bluebook data, since that report in 1969, it's been assumed

212
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:11,940
by, I don't know, the general public, but also by the governments of our adversaries

213
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:16,500
that the United States has secretly not only been studying this phenomenon, but perhaps

214
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,280
the Pentagon has been reverse engineering technology, right?

215
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,480
So the impression is, well, you know, the Americans know what's...

216
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,920
Not only do they know what's going on, they're probably developing some deterrence capability

217
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,560
with respect to UFOs.

218
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,160
This is the impression by Russians and Chinese and...

219
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,520
Russians, Chinese, right?

220
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,280
And that's the impression we will want them to have.

221
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,160
You want your adversaries to believe that A, not only do you know what it is, B, you're

222
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,480
developing countermeasures and perhaps you have technology based on it that could outmaneuver

223
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,840
them in any war.

224
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,920
So this report comes out and it says, well, gee, you know, we actually don't know what

225
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,120
these things are.

226
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,960
Some significant percentage of these are genuinely unidentified, not only unidentified, they're

227
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,820
unidentifiable.

228
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,840
No matter what we bring to bear on analyzing this, we don't know what these things are.

229
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,140
They outperform all of the military hardware that we have and folks, they're not manufactured

230
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,140
by us.

231
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:15,080
And by the way, it could be Russia or China.

232
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:20,840
How stupid are you from a national security perspective that you come out and say that

233
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:26,200
publicly, even if it were true, which it isn't.

234
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,360
You don't say that when you're responsible for the security of the nation.

235
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,360
Right?

236
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,200
I mean, this country has a larger military budget than the next 10 countries put together,

237
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,720
including Russia and China.

238
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,640
You mean to tell the American taxpayer, right, a trillion dollars, you know, of their money

239
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,200
of which you just burned in Afghanistan, but that's another issue.

240
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,560
You mean to tell the American taxpayer that with that kind of military budget that they're

241
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:56,320
funding, maybe China and Russia have manufactured these vehicles that are doing end runs around

242
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,800
our Air Force, you know, jets and our aircraft carriers.

243
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:08,460
And we're completely, you know, we are subject to the penetration of our most secure air

244
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,620
space with impunity by these objects.

245
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,680
And you're leaving open the possibility that they're actually hardware manufactured by

246
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,680
our adversaries.

247
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:24,240
That's a does that look the U.S. government, frankly, has lost legitimacy over that alone.

248
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,580
That is an abdication of the sovereignty of the United States in and of itself, regardless

249
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,960
of any other factors.

250
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,200
I mean, what is even the meaning of U.S. government now?

251
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,460
Because you're saying national security interests, but the interests of certain people within

252
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:45,240
the so-called U.S. government is completely different and not aligned at all with absolute

253
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,920
majority of Americans.

254
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,200
I mean, how can you mess up so badly in Afghanistan?

255
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,720
And then the only place that you've had a plan and schedule and everything for was to

256
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:02,080
bring tens of thousands of Afghanis without being vetted into U.S. soil and into the U.S.

257
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,080
territory.

258
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:11,680
I mean, it's so obvious that this is not a group of people who are collecting taxpayers

259
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:16,720
money, hard-earned money, while looking down at them and serving some other interests.

260
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,520
I don't know if they're bought out by the Chinese or whoever, but they're definitely

261
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,640
not aligned with the interests of America as you and I and a lot of other people would

262
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:33,480
consider that term to have any kind of a definition of meaning, America.

263
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:40,820
Look, tomorrow is September 11th, tomorrow.

264
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:51,400
You know, in the past 20 years in Afghanistan, the United States has supposedly been fighting

265
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,280
the Taliban and supposedly been trying to build a relatively secular Afghan civilian

266
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,440
government and give education to women and so on and so forth, right?

267
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,640
This is the story that we're told.

268
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:11,280
But if you actually go back to the beginning of the Afghan Civil War in 1978-79, you see

269
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:18,160
that what the United States did was they set up a base in Pakistan, the Arabic name of

270
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:29,280
which was Al-Qaeda, the base, and they brought Saudis and other Salafis and Wahabis to Pakistan

271
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:36,800
and sent them via Waziristan into Afghanistan to fight not just against the Soviet Union,

272
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:42,600
but to dominate other factions of the Afghan resistance like the Northern Alliance that

273
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,560
was led by Ahmad Shah Massoud.

274
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:51,240
One, I don't know, it was, what was it, within days, I think, of 9-11, the CIA assassinated

275
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,880
Ahmad Shah Massoud in Afghanistan to make sure that the Northern Alliance would not be a

276
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:01,360
viable force once the US became engaged in Afghanistan.

277
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,320
And so instead of fighting the Taliban for the past 20 years, which is the facade that's

278
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,880
been presented to us, what the United States did not just over the last 20 years, but frankly

279
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:17,160
since the beginning of the Afghan Civil War, is it took a group of uneducated, poorly organized

280
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:26,320
Talibs, religious students, mercenary religious students, and it put them on steroids by bringing

281
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,920
well-funded, well-armed Saudi and other Salafist forces into Afghanistan and creating this

282
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:38,660
super Taliban, which it has now successfully taken over the whole country, with US weapons

283
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:53,540
and equipment and...conveniently paid $85 billion to arm this mock-up Afghan military

284
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:58,300
that would then lay down all of its hardware, its attack helicopters, its tanks, everything,

285
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:02,440
so that the Taliban could be armed to the teeth with state-of-the-art American military

286
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:09,320
hardware paid for by the taxpayer, the same taxpayer that is being told that maybe China

287
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,840
and Russia are manufacturing flying saucers that outperform anything that our Air Force

288
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,840
and our Navy have.

289
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,640
What kind of government is this?

290
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,640
Yeah.

291
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:24,100
Yeah, I think a lot of people are asking that question now, which is, you know, it's terrible

292
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:29,280
what's happening, but it's also kind of in some kind of a desperate, twisted way, maybe

293
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:36,720
it can be seen as a silver lining, because when they're becoming so covert and so aggressive,

294
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:43,000
so obviously, it just shows to me, at least, that they're desperate and their narrative

295
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,200
is falling apart, and therefore they're just using intimidation and force and coercion

296
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,160
to force people to follow the narrative.

297
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,460
You know, I wish that were true.

298
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,000
I would love that to be the case.

299
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,160
Unfortunately, I think that what's actually going on is that there's a deliberate attempt

300
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:09,240
being made to dismantle the United States, and we've talked about this in other contexts.

301
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:18,920
I think that from 1945 to 1947, when we brought over those thousands of, you know, the brightest,

302
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:26,480
most industrious Nazis that Germany produced, and we embedded them at the deepest layers

303
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,680
of what became the military industrial complex, and we went and imported the entire East German,

304
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:37,880
I'm sorry, the entire East European spy network of Nazi Germany, the Galen Organization, into

305
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:45,680
the OSS and created the CIA, we wound up with a deep state in this country that never owed

306
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,960
its allegiance to the American people.

307
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:53,780
The objective of that, frankly, fascist deep state was to destroy the Soviet Union.

308
00:24:53,780 --> 00:25:00,880
It was to use the American industrial and economic power, this engine of industry in

309
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,640
the United States, to defeat Soviet communism, which was its primary adversary.

310
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:12,160
And lo and behold, within a decade of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, we get

311
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:18,760
September 11th and the global war on terror, the American invasion of Afghanistan, right?

312
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:24,720
And what an irony it will be if the graveyard of the Soviet Union, namely Afghanistan, also

313
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,240
becomes the graveyard of the United States.

314
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:34,120
And you know, within a few years after this fiasco in Afghanistan, the United States disintegrates

315
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:38,560
the way that the Soviet Union disintegrated within a couple of years of the Soviet withdrawal

316
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,200
from Afghanistan.

317
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,780
Probably harder, considering the amount of weapons and the kind of division that exists

318
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,560
in this country.

319
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:54,440
Much harder, because you see, look, Russia was still an ethnically and culturally cohesive

320
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:02,580
entity, even though they lost control over Kazakhstan and even Ukraine and so forth.

321
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,760
You know, the Russians have an ethos and an ethnos.

322
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:12,560
America is so internally divided that if the United States disintegrates, we're going to

323
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:18,440
see a horrific civil war in North America.

324
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:27,320
All kinds of conflict over resources, ethnic conflicts, you know, militarized class warfare

325
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,320
and so forth.

326
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,560
And so, yeah, I think the United States is going to fall harder than the Soviet Union.

327
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:39,920
But you know, to go back to your point, or your, I don't know, speculation, hypothesis-

328
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,920
My coping.

329
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,760
Yeah, I didn't want to put it that way.

330
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,920
But it's that I wish what you were saying is true.

331
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,240
The thing is, I think it's by design.

332
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:55,640
They're doing these absurdly, you know, self-destructive things because the people who are ultimately

333
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,740
designing these policies actually want to see America fail.

334
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:04,880
They have turned on the United States from inside and they're now transitioning to a

335
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,880
model of world order where China is used as the dominant vehicle for achieving their objectives.

336
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,520
Not the United States.

337
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:19,320
So what you said about you can't even recognize New Yorkers, I think the same can be said

338
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:24,120
about humanity in large, what's happening in Canada, in Australia, in specific.

339
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,840
And you see it a lot of people, not only that they're not doing anything against it, they're

340
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,840
rationalizing it just because they don't want to take any kind of an action.

341
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,480
Where are we headed?

342
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,420
Because what you're saying, and what I see, as I said, you know, there is a coping side

343
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:46,120
of like, well, maybe this is the case, I don't know, but based on what I'm also observing

344
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:55,180
with respect to humanity, there is not going to be any kind of a well-defined opposition

345
00:27:55,180 --> 00:28:02,700
against this incredibly focused and vicious kind of an attack on individualism.

346
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:07,820
Would you say that this is ultimately an attack on individualism?

347
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:17,480
Most definitely, and so that's why I focused my response on articulating a form of individualism

348
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:23,500
that is not spiritually bankrupt and materialistic.

349
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:30,680
One of the problems with the West, definitely from, you know, the 20th century onwards,

350
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:40,180
is that the Western emphasis on the liberty of the individual and on, you know, the autonomy

351
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:52,680
of the individual with respect to, you know, state power has been almost inextricably fused

352
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,520
with a kind of soulless materialism, right?

353
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:02,280
I mean, capitalism functioned as a kind of vehicle to free the individual to some extent,

354
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:14,340
but capitalism also degraded, you know, the human experience by hollowing out all higher

355
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:20,980
orienting values and by turning the individual into a consummate consumer, right?

356
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:26,340
And so I think if we're going to extricate ourselves from this situation, we need to

357
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:36,700
articulate a vision of individualism that is spiritually rooted and that has some higher

358
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:43,340
aims or goals and that can reorient the developmental trajectory of our whole civilization, that

359
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:49,620
can give man a sense of purpose and meaning again, while at the same time protecting the

360
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:57,340
individual from collectivism and from, you know, totalitarian state power.

361
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:02,540
So that's, you know, effectively what I'm trying to achieve with this Promethean vision

362
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,100
that I've set forth in my writings.

363
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:08,980
We absolutely need something like this because the only side, I see this wokeism and all

364
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,900
that, whatever you want to call it, as a replacement for religion.

365
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:18,880
This hollowing of the individual of any kind of anything other than the surface has been

366
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,300
done from my perspective is specifically to get rid of the concept of religion and quote

367
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:28,940
unquote God, just so state can become the higher power and the absolute authority.

368
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:32,820
But the thing is the only replacement for it at this point that I see there is some

369
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:39,540
kind of a backlash against the system is evangelical fundamentalist Christian rights that they're

370
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,100
hell bent as we see right now.

371
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:47,980
I mean, I'm not sure if this is a very good timing to push abortion into the narrative

372
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:54,180
when you're a few days away from the recall election in California and, you know, maybe

373
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:59,500
a year away from absolute tyranny to take over United States and all over the world

374
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,680
if there is no any kind of organized backlash.

375
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:10,800
And yet we are kind of stuck between this wokeism or Christian fundamentalism that now

376
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:17,820
it energizes certain base, certain part of the base of the Republicans to take over the

377
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:22,900
House, take over the Congress and take over the presidency they're saying in 2022 and

378
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,980
2024.

379
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,180
That's absolutely right.

380
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:31,860
You know, if something isn't done about it, what we're going to see within a decade is

381
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:37,420
the fracturing of the United States, some kind of a second civil war that results in

382
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:42,500
a neo Confederacy, which is theocratic in nature, where we're going to see a biblical

383
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:49,020
republic come from out of the South and, oh, what a wonderful alternative to wokeism, right?

384
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:52,620
I mean, talk about being between a rock and a hard place.

385
00:31:52,620 --> 00:32:01,780
And so, you know, we need to really get on this and begin preparing rapidly from now

386
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:08,860
to field a third way, another alternative, hopefully from out of the libertarian Western

387
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:14,660
States of America, you know, the Wild West, not including the West Coast.

388
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:19,660
But you know, there is a significant segment of the red states that are not evangelical

389
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:24,540
conservatives and that are more libertarian in their orientation.

390
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:29,780
And you know, while I certainly don't agree with Ayn Rand on many things, and, you know,

391
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:36,580
I have big problems with her objectivism, after all, remember that the vision of Atlas

392
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:42,620
was shrugged of a kind of, you know, utopia of liberty was based in the Western United

393
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:48,900
States, you know, gulch, gulch, Atlantis, quote unquote, was actually, you know, it

394
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,620
was in Westworld.

395
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:57,860
And I think that's a place that, you know, we need to very seriously think about turning

396
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:05,860
into some bastion of resistance against, you know, this, the machinations of these totalitarians

397
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:11,860
and that as America begins to collapse, as the United States begins to disintegrate,

398
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:18,340
we have to make sure that the center of gravity becomes that part of America and not, you

399
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:22,220
know, Dixie, not the Bible Belt.

400
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:25,780
That's a strategic objective that needs to be taken very seriously right now.

401
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:29,820
It's interesting, though, because what you're saying is absolutely in favor of individualism,

402
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:37,540
yet for any kind of a fundamental change, you require tribes to take over other tribes,

403
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:42,220
you know, not necessarily violently, but, you know, it's only a better idea that will

404
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,220
defeat an idea.

405
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:49,420
It's a more capable tool that will defeat a tool and it's only a more capable God that

406
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,020
will defeat a God.

407
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:57,400
And so where are we with respect to, for lack of a better word, making Prometheism into

408
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:05,380
a tribal kind of a gathering, tribal kind of a force, organized kind of a force?

409
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:16,740
Let me just say something on a deeper level about that.

410
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,740
Plato is a very complex thinker.

411
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,380
Plato is an esoteric writer.

412
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:25,540
There are all kinds of dimensions to Plato's thought.

413
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:31,920
And I think that the Platonists really are doing a disservice to Plato.

414
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:37,300
They misunderstood him fundamentally when they created this almost ideological system

415
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,340
based on his thought.

416
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:49,100
But Plato got something very right in Republic when he wrote that people need religion.

417
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:57,180
People need some kind of a spiritual ideology to serve as the backbone of a viable constitutional

418
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,180
order.

419
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:03,200
And this is one of the things that, you know, Prometheus blessed them, the founding fathers

420
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,940
of the United States did not really understand.

421
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:12,940
They projected their own free spiritedness onto the majority of society.

422
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:19,300
They misunderstood the mass of the American citizenry as potential Thomas Jefferson's

423
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:26,060
and, you know, potential Tom Payne's, right, failing to recognize that the ethos that they

424
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:36,260
had and the capacities that, you know, that were their own represent a tremendous deviation

425
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,260
from the norm.

426
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:44,820
I mean, these people were a spiritual elite who, you know, could have been a beacon of

427
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:49,100
enlightenment and liberation for the entire planet and in fact, you know, in some ways

428
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,700
were for a long time.

429
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:59,620
But they overestimated the capacity of the average person to find his own way and, you

430
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:04,020
know, define his own life under a constitutional order with something like, let's say, freedom

431
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:10,580
of religion, where, you know, the state has no defined religious orientation.

432
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:19,620
And you know, there was a letter actually that Jefferson wrote to Madison, I think,

433
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,700
after he was president, after he was in office.

434
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:28,400
And he basically wrote to Madison that in a couple of generations, there won't be any

435
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,420
Christianity left in this country, that, you know, with the system that we provided, this

436
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:37,380
kind of libertarian constitution and freedom of religion, we will, in effect, allow the

437
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:43,940
free space for an educational system to arise that gives people the tools to liberate themselves

438
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,900
and to elevate their own understanding.

439
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:53,020
And then he adds after he writes this passage to Madison, and if it turns out that I'm wrong

440
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:58,700
and that these Christians are still here in two or three generations, the experiment of

441
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,540
the United States will have proven a failure.

442
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:04,780
It will be reputation by experiment.

443
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:09,680
This is an experiment, he said to Madison, and it will have been shown that we were wrong

444
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,500
about human nature.

445
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:20,380
So again, going back to Plato and Republic, in response to what you were saying, people

446
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:28,260
need some higher orienting spiritual values or some deeply rooted basis for a constitutional

447
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,260
order.

448
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:34,340
A constitution isn't worth the paper it's written on if it's, you know, a set of soulless

449
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:43,420
laws that, you know, are not somehow a reflection of the ethical fiber of the people themselves.

450
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:50,300
And so, yes, I think Prometheism is or something, you know, like it is needed if we're going

451
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,340
to successfully navigate this crisis.

452
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:58,180
And in terms of, you know, the specific question of where we are at with that, I think that

453
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,900
it's an idea.

454
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:08,340
And the objective is to sell this idea to people with the resources to ensure that the

455
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:12,320
collapse of the United States, which cannot be stopped at this point, that the collapse

456
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:18,820
of the United States takes place in a fashion that yields a political order from out of

457
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:23,580
the Western states, hopefully, out of the libertarian part of this country, yields a

458
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:29,340
political order that can serve as at least a bastion of resistance and a staging ground

459
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:33,700
for a liberation struggle on this planet.

460
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:38,660
You mentioned Prometheism or something like it.

461
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:44,100
A lot of people ask about your thoughts on Dogen.

462
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:50,180
I don't want to talk about Dogen because he's not here to respond, but I'm curious to know

463
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:55,180
what would you consider as some other things like Prometheism?

464
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:59,780
What would you consider as alternatives to what exists right now that can be viable in

465
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:03,380
the tomorrow of this piece of land?

466
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:10,460
So my problem with Dogen's thought, and I briefly corresponded with him at one point,

467
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:15,580
my problem with Dogen's thought is that basically it's traditionalism.

468
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:24,020
You know, first of all, he doesn't really have an ontology or an epistemology.

469
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:32,820
Dogen is an interpreter of Heidegger, and he interprets Heidegger in a very conservative

470
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:43,380
way along the lines of this idea that our heritage determines our destiny and that we

471
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:54,780
need to appropriate what's been vouchsafed to us by our ancestors and our political order

472
00:39:54,780 --> 00:40:00,540
has to be based on the native tradition of our people and that we can replace the current

473
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:09,100
system with a multipolar world order organized around a number of different centers of gravity,

474
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:16,620
each one representing an organically unified civilization structured around a certain pith,

475
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:22,260
what he calls narod, an ethnos, that's the pith of a wider civilizational sphere.

476
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:27,140
In some ways it's not all that different from Samuel Huntington's idea of the class of civilizations.

477
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:33,180
And so it's like a Heideggerian version of Huntington's theory.

478
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:38,900
So you know, Dogen doesn't have, well, no, I shouldn't say he doesn't have a conception

479
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:51,340
of progress and the technological revolutionizing of human development, he does have a conception

480
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,340
of that.

481
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,340
He conceives of it as satanic.

482
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:58,660
I mean, you know, he's also a representative of Russian orthodoxy and coming from out of

483
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:03,620
a Russian orthodox worldview, he sees the forces that I would describe as Promethean

484
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:12,860
as, you know, offering humanity an empowering evolution beyond the limits of what currently

485
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,580
define the human condition.

486
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:22,740
He sees all of that as basically a temptation from Satan and that, you know, the Promethean

487
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:34,940
is effectively satanic and that modern technology is a demonic force that needs to be contained

488
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:42,300
and that, you know, effectively we should go back to some kind of a, you know, agrarian

489
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,100
traditional society.

490
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,340
So I don't really see that as a solution.

491
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:55,540
I, you know, I see that as an ideology that will be co-opted and used by the elites to

492
00:41:55,540 --> 00:42:01,620
de-industrialize large parts of the planet so that they can maintain a monopoly on singularity

493
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,180
level technologies.

494
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:06,540
Dogen is playing right into the hands of those people.

495
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:13,540
And in fact, I don't want to go too far into conspiratorial territory, but I'll just put

496
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:22,140
this out here that I know that there are some people very well-placed, let's say in the

497
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:29,780
British intelligence apparatus that are using Dogen for exactly that purpose and he doesn't

498
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:36,220
realize it, but his work is being promoted by people who certainly don't agree with him,

499
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:43,860
but they find his ideology a convenient way to have a model ready for a de-industrialized

500
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:50,180
neo-agrarian society where, you know, ignorance of the masses is enforced through traditionalism.

501
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:55,060
Yeah, that was the part that was kind of a head scratcher for me when people were like

502
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,620
what you were talking about in our first conversation.

503
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,740
It was completely aligned with Dogen.

504
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:04,540
I was like, my understanding of Dogen is that technology has no place in his philosophy

505
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,540
whatsoever.

506
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,540
It has a place.

507
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,540
I'll go.

508
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,540
It has a place.

509
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,540
It's considered demonic.

510
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,540
Right.

511
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:11,540
Right.

512
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:14,820
But not in the sense that it is part of human experience.

513
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:21,060
I can't even divide human evolution and technological evolution from each other.

514
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:26,420
What you described actually sounds very much like what Steve Bannon is doubling down now

515
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:30,980
these days, that transhumanism has become an inseparable part of the dialogue and my

516
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:35,980
understanding is that he knows that this is a losing war and he wants to make it into

517
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:42,140
human versus, or as he's saying it, homo sapien versus post homo sapien.

518
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:46,420
Now he doesn't phrase it that way versus that, but this is my understanding that they're

519
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,140
pushing this.

520
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:55,180
Anything that goes beyond the limits of biological humanity is basically, as you said, it's satanic,

521
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:59,180
it's evil, it's dark, and we basically have to go beyond that.

522
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:05,700
Well, isn't that convenient for the intelligences behind UFOs, right?

523
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:12,980
We are surrounded by some advanced technological civilization that's fielding these exotic

524
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:18,540
aircraft, and clearly it's a post-singularity civilization.

525
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:24,540
Whatever technologies that we're looking at, their convergence into the technological singularity

526
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:32,100
a generation from now, have already yielded a post-singularity civilization for the people

527
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,380
who are piloting UFOs.

528
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:43,300
The same entities that are regularly violating our most sensitive airspace already have the

529
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:49,140
level of technology and scientific knowledge that people like Bannon and Dugin want to

530
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,340
deny to humanity.

531
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:57,100
My position is that we should achieve technological parity with these entities or come as close

532
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:02,260
to it as possible and use that technology in a way that empowers the human individual

533
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:09,180
and gives us some fighting chance against their machinations to basically turn us into

534
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,740
a feudal serf population.

535
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:16,260
Do you see anyone else talking about the same thing because the only other person I can

536
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:22,940
think about except you that brings technology into the core of the issue, and he's not

537
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:27,700
arguing for the sake of governance, he's a philosopher, Yuval Noah Harari.

538
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:33,980
He sees the evolution very related with technology and humanity, and he goes beyond humanity

539
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:42,620
and all that, but I see you as a unique, very, very unique example that is a treasure to

540
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:47,940
some and a mortal enemy to some others as you just described because you hit right at

541
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:55,720
the target and it's so organic to human existence that it's very, very difficult to deny the

542
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:00,820
viability of it, and you really have to take refuge to some other kind of an ideology as

543
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:04,740
you described that technology is evil inherently.

544
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:09,660
Yes, unfortunately what you're saying is true.

545
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:15,980
The problem with people like Yuval Harari is that they're still trying to accommodate themselves

546
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:21,420
to the establishment to some extent and not engage with the data, say, of parapsychology

547
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:28,580
or get into ufology and whatever because they think that it will discredit them with respect

548
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:35,820
to the establishment, and at the very least one can say that's a miscalculation because

549
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:45,660
I guarantee you the establishment view on things like ESP or UFOs is going to change

550
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:54,780
dramatically within the next 15 to 20 years, and if we want to really develop an alternative

551
00:46:54,780 --> 00:47:00,980
to this global tyrannical system that's being put into place right now, we have to engage

552
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:09,060
with the full range of data and with everything that's been marginalized by the establishment

553
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:15,700
to date because the system that they want to put in place, the kind of technocratic

554
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:23,700
global totalitarian state that they're engineering, it completely incorporates knowledge of parapsychology,

555
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:29,980
and so to come up with a model that's a viable alternative to that, we need to do the same,

556
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,100
and you can't worry about being marginalized on account of it.

557
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,100
You have to think ahead.

558
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:39,300
You have to think at least a few decades ahead, which is what I'm doing, so yeah, unfortunately

559
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,300
you're right.

560
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:44,980
I mean, there aren't too many people doing that, and I wish there were, and so when I

561
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:49,860
said Prometheism or something like it, I mean like, look, if you have a problem with what

562
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:51,580
I'm doing, show me a better way.

563
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:53,220
I'll sign on.

564
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,360
Show me a more viable alternative.

565
00:47:55,360 --> 00:48:01,340
If I see something better than what I've come up with, I'll go contribute to that project.

566
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:02,980
Yeah.

567
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:05,860
Let's go back to your book, Closer Encounters.

568
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:11,820
You mentioned that you published a book as an alternative to the description of what's

569
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:13,860
happening that's coming from the US government.

570
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:14,940
What is your description?

571
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:18,320
What is your perspective about what is happening?

572
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,320
What are these machines?

573
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,680
What are these entities behind these machines?

574
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:32,900
So first of all, I engage with the full range of data, meaning that the book talks about

575
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:33,900
abductions.

576
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:40,580
I mean, the UAP report said nothing about close encounters, even of the second kind,

577
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:44,060
let alone close encounters of the third and the fourth kind.

578
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:47,320
The report was focused on what are called close encounters of the first kind, which

579
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:51,940
are UFO sightings or the tracking of UFO by radar or something.

580
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:57,580
Close encounters of the second kind are when a UFO lands and leaves traces, like landing

581
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:04,460
gear marks or radioactive traces in the places where it landed, things like that.

582
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:09,380
Close encounters of the third kind are when beings or entities are seen in association

583
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:13,740
with UFOs, and then the fourth kind are abductions.

584
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:18,100
So I deal with the full range of close encounters in this book, and that's one huge point of

585
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:21,940
divergence from the UAP report.

586
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:26,900
And I think that eventually we will hear from the government about abductions and implants

587
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:32,180
and mutilations and the other subjects that I discussed, but we'll hear about it at a

588
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:41,620
time and in a way that suits their purposes in terms of rolling out this global totalitarian

589
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:45,240
system.

590
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:50,560
And so one of the things that I argue in this book is that we're probably eventually going

591
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:55,140
to be given a narrative that they're the good guys and they're the bad guys.

592
00:49:55,140 --> 00:50:01,100
And you've got these nefarious gray aliens here who are abducting your children in the

593
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:06,880
middle of the night and they're implanting you and they're responsible for cattle mutilations.

594
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:14,700
But then there are these beautiful, blonde, tall white ancestors who created us in distant

595
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:19,460
antiquity and we are their offspring and they're our great ancestors, to put it in the language

596
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:21,500
of Chinese Confucianism.

597
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:30,580
And they are going to protect us from this diabolical enemy that's coming here and abducting

598
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:32,260
people in the middle of the night.

599
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,980
And the whole thing is a good cop, bad cop routine.

600
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,020
It's a hydra.

601
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:41,680
It's one entity with two or more heads and it's being used to create a false alternative

602
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:50,900
in order to get us to submit to a control system that already, I argue, has shaped the

603
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:54,100
religious beliefs of the majority of humanity.

604
00:50:54,100 --> 00:51:00,580
One of the lines of argument in Closer Encounters is that the quote unquote revealed religions

605
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:07,660
are actually psychosocial control mechanisms put in place by the beings behind this phenomenon.

606
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:18,620
And so I argue in this book that instead of falling prey to this good cop, bad cop routine,

607
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:25,860
we ought to take a closer look at who exactly these beings are and what exactly the nature

608
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:29,100
of the control system that we're ensconced in is.

609
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:36,340
And my thesis is that what we're really dealing with here are not aliens coming from zeta

610
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:43,380
reticuli or being caught in a war between two different alien races.

611
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:55,300
What we're dealing with here is the deleterious effects of a group of human time travelers

612
00:51:55,300 --> 00:52:02,220
on the continuum of our history, that time travel was achieved at a certain point in

613
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:06,740
human history, and that the people who achieved time travel technology, the people who harnessed

614
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:13,980
zero point energy and constructed anti-gravity propulsion systems and vehicles that also

615
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:19,380
are time machines, those people effectively set themselves up as gods over the rest of

616
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:25,020
us by being able to deal with the variables of human history on a fifth dimensional level.

617
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:35,380
In other words, to tinker with our 4D history from a higher dimensional vantage point.

618
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:37,500
And that that's really the nature of the problem.

619
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:45,220
And that's why we shouldn't expect any disclosure from any of our governments, any of the governments

620
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:49,360
of the leading world powers, because this is not a question of the defense of humanity

621
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,260
from some alien entity.

622
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:57,460
It's a question of being inside of an invisible control system set up by humanity to oppress

623
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:59,940
humanity.

624
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:04,180
Would you say that they're going traveling back in time to change something in the future

625
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,240
or they're just doing it to look?

626
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,020
What is the purpose?

627
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:12,780
If they've already achieved the God status and God capability?

628
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:13,780
Yeah.

629
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:19,260
What's the purpose of any political system for the people who lead it?

630
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:21,020
Right?

631
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:26,820
Once you are operating on a fifth dimensional level and you have, you know, zero point energy

632
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:33,500
that allows you to traverse space time and set up societies that you control in different

633
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:42,220
epochs, well, you know, why would you operate with any logic other than the logic of colonialism

634
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:45,300
and mass oppression that's determined most of human history?

635
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,300
Right?

636
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:50,700
I mean, what we're dealing with are people with the same colonial mentality that the

637
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:55,940
British Empire had, except they have time travel technology.

638
00:53:55,940 --> 00:54:02,180
And you know, they see the majority of the human population as an animal farm, as a herd

639
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:05,140
that they want to maintain control over.

640
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:10,020
And they have all these beautiful justifications for it, which I get into in my book, like,

641
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:16,140
for example, that there's a cosmic order and they are higher evolved beings who are creating

642
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:22,420
a microcosm of the cosmic order, which allows people with a low level of consciousness to

643
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:27,460
cultivate themselves lifetime after lifetime through duty and service in their respective

644
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:33,940
caste so that they can ultimately, you know, make their way up to the rung of the system

645
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:37,980
that these putative gods see themselves as belonging on.

646
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:38,980
Cosmic experts.

647
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:39,980
Yeah, exactly.

648
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:43,900
Cosmic experts, you know, the Brahmins of the old Hindu caste system.

649
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,100
Right.

650
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:50,780
And so, you know, and look, the British colonialists thought this way, too, about the Indian population

651
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:53,300
and various Africans that they govern.

652
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:58,100
So, you know, with reference to Charles Forth, among other people, I argue that effectively

653
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:04,580
we're colonized, we're in a colonial system, and we're also in a system that resembles

654
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:11,980
a farm where we're being tagged like animals and monitored and, again, they'll provide

655
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:17,300
all kinds of sophisticated justifications for this, but really it's because they're

656
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:21,860
sadists and they're drunk on their own power, like, you know, the governors of any colonial

657
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:22,860
system.

658
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:23,860
Yeah.

659
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:24,860
Not bad.

660
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:30,980
And there are people in our timeline right now that you would say are in contact with

661
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:33,620
them and are aware of this dynamic?

662
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:34,620
Oh, yeah.

663
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:35,620
Oh, absolutely.

664
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:41,940
I think that even the people involved in the UAP preliminary assessment at the highest

665
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:45,100
level know exactly what's going on.

666
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:51,260
When the Office of Naval Intelligence is audited by the Senate to hand over its entire dossier

667
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:57,260
of close encounter reports, going back to the 1940s, and they come back and they talk

668
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:04,580
about the Omaha and this one and that one from 2000 and, you know, the Nimitz and the

669
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:09,780
Omaha from, like, 2004, 2007, that's all they have to give, well, listen, an executive

670
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:14,660
decision was made at some level by somebody who knows what's going on, who's got all

671
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:20,380
the data in front of them, who basically said, yeah, well, you know, to Congress, you know,

672
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:24,300
we'll hand over what we want to hand over that allows us to spin this in a way that

673
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:28,700
protects the plan, that protects the overall plan.

674
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:33,820
And so, yes, I think that there are liaisons, you know, at a high level in the Navy and

675
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:40,420
other branches of the military, there are liaisons who are meeting with members of this

676
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:47,020
what I call the Nordic breakaway civilization, a time traveling breakaway civilization that's

677
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:49,380
operating on a hyperdimensional level.

678
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:54,980
Are these the same as lizard people?

679
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:57,940
I get into that briefly in this book.

680
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:06,340
I'm not convinced that these quote unquote reptilians are actually aliens.

681
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:11,180
If you consider our own genetic engineering capabilities right now, let alone what they'll

682
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:17,620
be, you know, on the other side of the technological singularity in a generation, even now in the

683
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:24,620
top laboratories in the world, we could take dinosaur DNA, which we have, I mean, this

684
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:27,740
is the Jurassic Park scenario, right?

685
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:32,140
We could take dinosaur DNA and splice it with human DNA, particularly if you take the DNA

686
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:39,820
of something like a Deinonychus, which was a like five foot tall bipedal dinosaur with

687
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:45,180
opposable thumbs and binocular vision, and you splice it with human DNA, you can create

688
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:48,260
a reptilian humanoid.

689
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:53,740
And you know, I think it's possible that entities like that, like the so-called reptilians,

690
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:58,220
are really products of a kind of Frankenstein's laboratory, not necessarily, you know, aliens

691
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:01,940
coming here from somewhere else.

692
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:04,740
Have you heard of stoned ape theory?

693
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:05,740
Yes.

694
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:11,020
Terence McKenna, so that's very interesting, because the argument is that our brain evolved

695
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,380
much faster than the rest of our body.

696
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:19,900
And some people are saying that actually the modern humans are the result of being genetically

697
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:25,420
modified by extraterrestrial or maybe, as you were saying, humans who are time traveling

698
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:27,980
from the future.

699
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:34,100
But stoned ape theory is interesting to me because I've had numerous amount of psychedelic

700
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:35,500
experiences.

701
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:43,500
And on some of the substances like DMT, you encounter some of these beings that it's really

702
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:47,980
pointless to even talk about it because it's beyond words what is happening, but it seems

703
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:55,420
more real than this dimension or this reality, however you want to define it.

704
00:58:55,420 --> 00:59:05,240
Do you see any kind of an alignment between these interests and some of the substances

705
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:09,540
that are available on this planet, like psychedelic substances?

706
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:14,140
And perhaps that could be the reason that we have evolved the way we have evolved for

707
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:16,820
the past tens of thousands of years.

708
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:21,820
Well, it's a complex question, but yes, I do.

709
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:25,940
In my book, In Closer Encounters, and this is a line of argument that I already began

710
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:33,420
to unfold in Prometheism, I argue that we're living in a quantum computational system,

711
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:37,180
that the cosmos is like a gigantic quantum computer.

712
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:39,180
Simulation?

713
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:44,180
The problem with the word simulation is that it implies that there's a reality and that

714
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:52,300
this is a simulacrum of that reality, whereas what I actually think is going on is that

715
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:56,060
it's just the nature of the cosmos to be a computational system.

716
00:59:56,060 --> 01:00:00,540
And there are many nested programs inside this system.

717
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:05,580
So you could say it's like a simulation within a simulation within a simulation, but there's

718
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:09,240
no original that this is a simulacrum of.

719
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:13,380
Information processing is just the nature of the computational cosmos.

720
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:20,940
And substances like DMT, I think, are hacks to get to a higher reference level inside

721
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:27,820
the information processing system, that there's a wider cyberspace beyond the parameters of

722
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:33,460
the reality that we're inside of, beyond the limits of the program that we are functioning

723
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:35,260
in the context of right now.

724
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:43,100
And the substances like DMT or other psychedelics basically allow you an access portal to another

725
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:49,740
level of cyberspace, and that these beings like reptilians and mantids and so forth that

726
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:56,460
are seen in that level on that dimension, if you want to put it in that language, are

727
01:00:56,460 --> 01:01:02,260
beings that know how to use this technology, namely the technology of psychedelics, in

728
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:06,900
order to navigate the cyberspace more effectively than we can.

729
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:14,380
And so I suspect that part of the metaphor of the forbidden fruit in Eden, which we find

730
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:23,180
in the book of Genesis, is that at least some part of that was exposure to psychedelics,

731
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:30,220
that there was a kind of Promethean rebel faction within the breakaway civilization,

732
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:35,940
the Titans as it were, who split with the gods and became advocates of humanity, Titans

733
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:43,980
like Prometheus, or in an Iranian context, Ahura Mazda, or Mithra or something.

734
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:48,300
I was actually going to ask you if Ahura Mazda is the same as Prometheus.

735
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:50,300
Short answer, yes.

736
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:58,580
And so I think that part of the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge was psychedelics

737
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:01,220
and its transformative potential for human consciousness.

738
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:06,940
Yeah, John Allegro, he has an entire thesis that Jesus himself was a mushroom, that people

739
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:12,500
basically took and had these experiences, a manna from heaven and all those things.

740
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:17,060
I wish that Jesus were a mushroom.

741
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:21,220
If you want to know what I think about Jesus, read, read closer encounters, but yeah, if

742
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:23,380
only Jesus were a mushroom, that would be great.

743
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:27,020
Yeah, I mean, we don't, can we even know who Jesus really was?

744
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:33,500
Because the idea that is being presented, I don't buy it at all whatsoever because there

745
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:38,300
is a group of people who believe that Jesus actually didn't die and he went back to Kashmir

746
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:43,740
and there is a tomb and shrine for Jesus right there, which to me, it is more evidence than

747
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:52,740
what they're saying that, oh, he went up and will come back with Imam Zaman kind of idea.

748
01:02:52,740 --> 01:03:00,300
To make a very long story short, the guy who died in Kashmir was Apollonius of Tiana.

749
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:04,300
He was born at the same time as Jesus.

750
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:08,280
He taught in Judea using the Aramaic language.

751
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:22,980
He was from Syria and he was a Pythagorean Mithraic initiate who basically preached his

752
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:27,740
philosophical religion in the vernacular of every culture that he encountered.

753
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:34,260
He attempted to translate his esoteric teaching in a language that a local culture would understand.

754
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:38,580
He also was conversant in Aramaic, which was a kind of lingua franca of that region, and

755
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:40,180
he taught in Judea.

756
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:45,340
When you read The Life of Apollonius of Tiana by Philostratus, who was a noted Roman author,

757
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:53,180
we have almost no objective trace of this Jesus character in the literary high culture

758
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:58,700
of the Roman Empire, in Roman histories, chronicles, anything, we can't find this Jesus character.

759
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:05,500
But one of the most notable Roman authors wrote a biography of Apollonius of Tiana,

760
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:08,940
and there were statues of this guy in many Roman cities.

761
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:15,780
According to this biography, the guy performed exactly the same miracles as Jesus when he

762
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:27,820
was in Judea, exactly the same miracles, bringing Lazarus back from the dead, healing people

763
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:33,140
who were maimed in various ways, had various ailments.

764
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:38,920
Point for point, the Roman authorities attempt to crucify Apollonius of Tiana.

765
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:45,980
He escapes crucifixion and travels through greater Iran into northern India, where he

766
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:49,580
lives to a ripe old age and dies there.

767
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:57,740
And interestingly, the name Jesus in Hebrew, Yeshua, just means savior.

768
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:00,460
So it's a title, it's not a name, right?

769
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:05,860
So Apollonius could easily have been called Yeshua when he was preaching to Essenes and

770
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:09,140
other people in Judea.

771
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:14,260
So I think the guy who died in Kashmir was Apollonius of Tiana.

772
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:18,580
But then there's a whole other thing going on in terms of this Jesus Christ.

773
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:23,100
And that's where we get into the close encounter phenomenon.

774
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:30,740
There are many specific details in the Gospels that have to do with his baptism in the Jordan,

775
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:36,100
the so-called transfiguration event, the resurrection, the ascension.

776
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:41,580
There are classic descriptions of close encounter phenomena of the type that you find all over

777
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:50,100
the Old Testament, from the story of Moses and the Exodus to the tens of UFOs that Ezekiel

778
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:56,460
sees, the coordination of the siege of the city of Jericho between Joshua and the commander

779
01:05:56,460 --> 01:06:01,140
of the Lord's army, who's one of these tall Nordics.

780
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:14,260
The features of the Gospel account of the life of Jesus that basically have all the

781
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:19,180
characteristics of a close encounter phenomena suggest that something else was also going

782
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:24,460
on at that time and place besides the itinerant preaching of Apollonius of Tiana.

783
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:31,980
Some kind of psyop was run in order to create this character, this image, this icon, Jesus

784
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:41,340
Christ, son of Abraham, son of David, a Moshiach of the Jews, who would ultimately also become

785
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:44,900
the second of the three great messengers of Islam.

786
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:52,620
And so this is what I find profoundly troubling and which I discuss at length in my book.

787
01:06:52,620 --> 01:07:02,800
Probably there was Apollonius of Tiana as a genuine spiritual teacher as the basis for

788
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,940
some elements of the biography of Jesus.

789
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:11,180
But then there was overlaid onto that some kind of a psyop and social engineering project

790
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:22,860
which reshaped the raw material of Apollonius's mission in Judea into this monstrosity that

791
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:28,060
is the institution of the Catholic Church or the Orthodox Church into this machinery

792
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:35,100
that carried out the Holy Inquisition and other atrocities against the human individual

793
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:36,620
throughout the course of centuries.

794
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:38,580
To corrupt it, basically.

795
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:47,700
Yeah, I mean look, if Apollonius was the basis for some of the more positive and enlightening

796
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:55,180
aspects of the teachings of Jesus, it has been corrupted beyond any recognition and

797
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:58,660
no attempt should be made to salvage it whatsoever.

798
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:09,060
If Apollonius of Tiana could see what was done in order to produce Jesus Christ from

799
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:18,100
out of whatever he was up to in Judea, I think that he himself would side with the antichrist,

800
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:22,660
would basically become an advocate for Lucifer.

801
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:30,060
So what is stopping a branch of Christians to pursue technological route and bring Jesus

802
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:32,860
back in a form of hologram?

803
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:38,260
There are Christians who are leveraging technology.

804
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:40,540
There is a Mormon transhumanist organization.

805
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:43,940
I had their founder and president on the podcast, this is years ago.

806
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:50,900
And I also had a gentleman who is a reverend and a PhD who had argued, this is like five

807
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:56,420
six years ago, that we have to use artificial intelligence in order to evangelize Christianity

808
01:08:56,420 --> 01:09:00,500
because we're basically being left behind.

809
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:09,420
Yeah, well you know, look, I mean I'm pausing because I'm so dismayed by these kinds of

810
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:10,420
things.

811
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:11,420
I mean I've seen them in my own life.

812
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:18,260
I've been involved with people who on the face of it seemed very intelligent, well read,

813
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:19,260
and so forth.

814
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:25,180
And then in the end they just use their intellect to defend these retarded, regressive religious

815
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:26,180
ideologies.

816
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:30,620
This is exactly what you're talking about, like the idea that you would use advanced

817
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:39,780
technology, singularity level technology, to manufacture the vindication of your prophetic

818
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:40,780
literature.

819
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:46,940
That you would sort of manufacture the second coming of Christ using advanced technology.

820
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:51,700
This is what I'm really concerned about, is that, you know, back in the Cold War there

821
01:09:51,700 --> 01:10:00,140
was a plan, I think in the 1970s, when they first started developing holographic technology,

822
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:07,220
the CIA had this plan to go off the coast of Cuba and paint a hologram of the Virgin

823
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:14,940
Mary over the island of Cuba in order to incite a revolution against Fidel Castro.

824
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:20,820
And I can well imagine that, especially if we have that kind of biblical republic that

825
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:25,300
we were talking about earlier, arise from out of the American South, and some of these

826
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:34,180
people still have access to high-tech companies and various resources to use singularity technologies

827
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:40,340
that come online in the next couple decades, that a kind of second coming will be technologically

828
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:50,020
manufactured and used in order to cement this global totalitarian system, which is one of

829
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:57,780
the reasons why I am so vehemently opposed to the whole project of the revealed religions,

830
01:10:57,780 --> 01:11:05,420
and why I've been emphatic that Prometheus is Lucifer, that Lucifer is the Latin name

831
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:12,060
of Prometheus, and that the reason I'm choosing Prometheus is because it's a symbol that doesn't

832
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:13,700
depend on Christianity.

833
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:20,340
The image of Satan or of Lucifer is sort of a reaction against Judeo-Christianity and

834
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:23,520
it was formed within a Judeo-Christian context.

835
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:30,340
So in a way it's parasitic upon the Abrahamic revelation, whereas Prometheus is like the

836
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:35,060
Satan before Satan, the original Satan, right?

837
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:45,820
And so at the same time though, I'm perfectly, not only willing, but I'm perfectly clear

838
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:51,540
in acknowledging that from a Judeo-Christian or an Islamic perspective, Prometheus is Satan

839
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:53,180
or Lucifer.

840
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:57,460
And a lot of people come to me and they say like, this is, what are you doing?

841
01:11:57,460 --> 01:12:03,660
This is a disastrous strategy, you're alienating the majority of people, blah, blah, whatever.

842
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:04,860
We're in serious danger.

843
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:09,220
These people are thinking about manufacturing the second coming of Christ.

844
01:12:09,220 --> 01:12:10,220
They are.

845
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:11,220
They are.

846
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:13,380
They're thinking about manufacturing the second coming of Christ.

847
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:17,820
Because I just said it hypothetically, that what is stopping a group of people to do that?

848
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:27,020
They're planning to do this and we need a very hardcore resistance movement that is

849
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:32,060
unequivocally opposed to this Christian and Islamic bullshit.

850
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:35,580
There can't be any compromise.

851
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:42,180
You need a backbone that can stand up against the second coming, a technologically engineered

852
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:45,660
apocalypse.

853
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:49,380
How far away are we, do you think, from that point?

854
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:52,700
30 to 50 years.

855
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:53,700
Wow.

856
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:55,540
That's crazy.

857
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:59,860
It's unbelievable how fast it's happening and it's also unbelievable how blind people

858
01:12:59,860 --> 01:13:04,780
are to realize that it is happening faster and faster because technology is advancing

859
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:06,780
exponentially.

860
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:14,180
Our experience is linear, but our experience absolutely depend and is defined on a basis

861
01:13:14,180 --> 01:13:18,420
of technological advancement and progress, which is exponential.

862
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:23,900
That's basically the whole purpose of humanity merging with technology at some point in order

863
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:30,140
to create whatever it is going beyond this biological limits that can be biological but

864
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:33,740
also ideological with respect to Christianity and Islam and all these things that we talked

865
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:34,740
about.

866
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:35,740
That's right.

867
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:43,060
Look, when you graph the approach to the technological singularity, there's this steep curve that

868
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:51,100
takes place from the 20th century into the 21st century where progress is being made

869
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:57,060
at such an exponential rate that over the course of every decade, there's more technological

870
01:13:57,060 --> 01:14:03,060
development than has taken place over preceding centuries until finally you get to the point

871
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:06,860
where the steep curve becomes a spike.

872
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:09,100
That spike is the singularity.

873
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:16,020
What these people want is to deindustrialize large parts of the planet on the Dugan model,

874
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:21,220
the traditionalist neo-agrarian Dugan model, deindustrialize large parts of the planet,

875
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:26,140
retain a monopoly on these emerging singularity level technologies, secret them away from

876
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:30,900
the majority of the population, and then use these technologies in order to manufacture

877
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:36,500
the apocalypse and project the second coming that is used to cement their millennium of

878
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:39,100
totalitarian tyranny over the planet.

879
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:40,100
Wow.

880
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:42,940
Crazy times.

881
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:45,940
Where do you see the role of Iran in this world?

882
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:52,340
For me, Iran could be the fulcrum of the whole damn thing.

883
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:53,900
Why?

884
01:14:53,900 --> 01:15:03,580
Because first of all, no country is more Promethean in its foundation than Iran.

885
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:07,900
This goes back to what you were asking earlier about Ahura Mazda and Prometheanism, right?

886
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:16,820
The Hakhaw Manasheed state ideology, the state ideology of the first empire known to human

887
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:28,940
history, a cosmopolitan world order that encompassed almost the entire known world, where half

888
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:33,620
of the population of earth at that time were citizens of the Persian Empire.

889
01:15:33,620 --> 01:15:37,060
The state ideology of that regime was Promethean.

890
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:38,060
That's what that was.

891
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:44,740
If you look at what Darius the Great was doing with the development of the banking system,

892
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:50,020
with the standardizing of coinage, with the royal road system, this intercontinental highway

893
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:55,900
that he was building, with his geoengineering projects, the canals, the bridges, et cetera,

894
01:15:55,900 --> 01:16:01,060
this guy was a titanic Promethean builder.

895
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:07,300
This ideal of Ahura Mazda and Sephant Aminu, the progressive mentality, the forward-oriented

896
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:13,700
mentality, and the fire of the forge that Iran was oriented around spiritually at that

897
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:19,900
time, that is the beginning, at least in recorded history, of the Promethean trajectory of development

898
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:26,740
that's taken up in the European enlightenment by people like the Marquis de Condorcet and

899
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:29,420
Hegel and so forth.

900
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:30,420
And so good.

901
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:35,540
Correct me if I'm wrong, because I think my understanding is that Mithraism pretty much

902
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:43,380
took over the world until Christianity merged with the Roman state in order to create political

903
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:48,160
Christianity to stop the growth and spread of Mithraism.

904
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:49,160
Is that correct?

905
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:52,840
Call me a conspiracy theorist, but it was done by design.

906
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:57,020
We were this close to taking the Roman Empire.

907
01:16:57,020 --> 01:17:01,860
Iran and Rome would have merged, they would have become one entity stretching from Spain

908
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:07,140
to the border of China under Mithraism.

909
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:13,140
It would have been as Hacham and Ashit Empire 2.0, much more expansive.

910
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:19,340
And instead of having this retarded ideology of Christianity be the spiritual backbone

911
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:23,980
of the colonization of the Americas, the Americas would have been colonized from out of the

912
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:29,540
old world by Mithras who are interested in liberation and progress, which literally would

913
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:33,260
have been the return of Quetzalcoatl to the Mayan territories.

914
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:39,820
These poor Mayans who had their own Promethean figure in distant antiquity, namely Quetzalcoatl,

915
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:44,780
who fought a battle against Tezcatlpoca, their Zeus, the god of the smoking mirror.

916
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:49,080
Tezcatlpoca is the guy who taught them how to cut human hearts out on tops of pyramids

917
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,860
and sacrifice people and all that.

918
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:57,620
Quetzalcoatl is their Prometheus figure, and he was actually described as being a tall

919
01:17:57,620 --> 01:18:02,180
Nordic looking person together with his companions.

920
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:07,560
So these poor Mayans were told by Quetzalcoatl that they would come back one day and save

921
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:11,660
them from this tyrannical, archontic bastard Tezcatlpoca.

922
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:17,300
And so when the Spaniards showed up, these Mayan priests misinterpreted them as the return

923
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:25,100
of Quetzalcoatl, and instead these inquisitorial Christians plundered the Mayan world and burned

924
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:29,500
all their codices and so on and so forth.

925
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:34,860
Now if Mithraism had conquered the Roman Empire and the expansion further to the west from

926
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:40,500
Spain into the Americas had taken place under the banner of Mithraism, of a Mithraic Rome

927
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:46,700
that had fused with Iran, imagine how different the contact with the Mayans would have been.

928
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:48,500
And that future was stolen from us.

929
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:52,860
This is what I mean when I say the variables of our 4D history have been messed with on

930
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:54,300
a fifth dimensional level.

931
01:18:54,300 --> 01:19:00,580
It's things like this, the creation of Christianity to change the timeline so that we wind up

932
01:19:00,580 --> 01:19:07,420
with this horrendous Catholic plundering of South America instead of a Mithraic enlightenment

933
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:12,900
in South America, Mithraic reclamation of Mayan culture and so forth that we could have

934
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:13,900
had.

935
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:17,700
Yeah, interesting, you mentioned the Mayans.

936
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:22,180
I've done a lot of DMT and many times, there are two different kinds, right?

937
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:26,780
There's a natural one that comes, which by itself it must be an alien kind of an interference

938
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:34,420
because there's one specie out of 7,000 plus amphibian specie, this toad, bufo, that generates

939
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:39,700
the poison on its back and on its gland that you milk it basically and dry it and you smoke

940
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:46,140
it and that's the natural DMT and it's only this toad that generate that kind of a substance.

941
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:51,300
The other one is NNDMT, which is concentrated chemically created.

942
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:56,300
You need to take three hits, visuals are way more profound than the bufo one.

943
01:19:56,300 --> 01:20:03,740
And I have come across the imagery of massive pyramid with Mayan symbology on them, massive

944
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:09,540
blue and gold usually, pyramids with Mayan symbology around them coming across variety

945
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:11,460
of these entities.

946
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:19,340
I have never seen a cross or image of someone who like, I'm Jesus, I'm Christ and I'm not

947
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:22,580
like, I don't have any kind of a bias against it.

948
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:28,700
I think the humanity's mission from the beginning has been to identify this kind of a central

949
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:36,180
point of alliance, central point of alignment that you said Mithraism, Prometheism and that

950
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:42,020
has been stolen, this definition of the divine that we all basically can see ourself as a

951
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:43,980
reflection of it.

952
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:45,700
And so I just wanted to share that experience.

953
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:51,300
I don't know if you had experiences with these kind of things, DMT especially, but I think

954
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:53,540
that we got to get to some really interesting places.

955
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:58,700
There is a place right now, DMTX, I think they're calling it, that they've developed

956
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:03,660
this machine that will keep you going in that realm for hours instead of like the 20 or

957
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:05,940
40 minutes and they want to map that realm.

958
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:09,220
They believe that this is not a projection of mind.

959
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:15,700
As you said, this is like a hacking or I think of it as the retuning of a receiver in order

960
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:21,420
to be able to interact with this kind of, with these dimensioned wards, layers, whatever

961
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:24,060
you want to call it.

962
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:27,980
I completely support that type of work.

963
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:31,980
I think one important point to make in response to what you said is that first of all, I'm

964
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:36,540
very glad that you didn't see Jesus.

965
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:39,740
I probably wouldn't make more money if I'd seen Jesus.

966
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:40,740
Probably.

967
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:47,140
And, you know, I've never said this on air before, but I've seen Jesus.

968
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:51,620
And in retrospect, frankly, I wasn't that impressed.

969
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:57,340
And you know, I think that at this point really has to be made that we are dealing with people

970
01:21:57,340 --> 01:22:04,700
who have what I call a psychotronic technology and they have a kind of technology that's

971
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:07,200
on the other side of the spectral revolution.

972
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:14,820
They have a technology that fully incorporates scientifically rigorous knowledge of ESP,

973
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:16,620
psychokinesis and so forth.

974
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:22,220
And so it's not difficult for these beings to project images into your mind.

975
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:25,460
You know, it's razzle dazzle is what it is.

976
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:31,820
And you should always consult your own conscience and examine your own ethos, not be awed by

977
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:41,540
whatever psychic projections these beings want to use in order to capture you, basically.

978
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:51,420
And so, yeah, if you do see Jesus, please ask him what he thinks about the Holy Inquisition

979
01:22:51,420 --> 01:22:56,660
or about what was done to the Mayans, please ask him about Hypatia of Alexandria, who was

980
01:22:56,660 --> 01:23:03,380
skinned alive and burned at the stake under the orders of, you know, Bishop Kirill, who

981
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:07,580
was subsequently turned into a saint and canonized by the church.

982
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:11,820
I think maybe these are some good questions to run by him in case you see Jesus.

983
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:12,820
You're a witch burning.

984
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:16,900
And by the way, have you ever heard of Apollonius of Tiana?

985
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:21,980
Now it's interesting that you saw Jesus, was it on like, feel free not to answer, but I'm

986
01:23:21,980 --> 01:23:25,140
interested to see whether or not you were under influence of any kind of a substance

987
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:29,260
or like meditation or something like that.

988
01:23:29,260 --> 01:23:33,060
The disturbing answer is no, I wasn't under the influence of any of those things, which

989
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:37,100
makes it all the more impressive, disturbing and impressive.

990
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:43,620
And I have to tell you that these things are these these things can't help but to be impressive

991
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:46,260
in the moment in which you're in that experience.

992
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:50,580
And this is actually one of my problems with a lot of these people who are acid heads and

993
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:56,060
users of psychedelic substances, psychedelics, again, as I said, there are potentially very

994
01:23:56,060 --> 01:24:04,460
empowering technology, but not at the expense of your, you know, reasoning capacity and

995
01:24:04,460 --> 01:24:09,780
your examination of your own conscience and also your sense of social and political responsibility.

996
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:11,100
Right.

997
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:18,460
So you need to be able to contextualize any psychedelic or mind-expanding experience,

998
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:22,420
even if it comes, let's say from meditation, you need to be able to contextualize it with

999
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:24,500
all those other factors considered.

1000
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:29,260
So this is, for example, one of my problems actually, even with Gotama, is that when you

1001
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:40,140
look carefully at the things that Gotama was preaching, you know, Sakamuni, Buddha, Sakamuni

1002
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:47,380
had an experience of extremely refined, subtle states of consciousness that are, you know,

1003
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:52,820
even beyond what most people on psychedelics are capable of experiencing.

1004
01:24:52,820 --> 01:25:00,700
But and and this is another very important point, Sakamuni explained to people that you

1005
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:05,260
could come away from these types of experiences with the delusion that there's a God because

1006
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:09,180
you lose your sense of your ego and you kind of feel like everything is sort of all one.

1007
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:10,180
Right.

1008
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:11,180
Yep.

1009
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:15,700
But he was also an ultra rational person, Gotama Buddha was, and he could explain how this

1010
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:20,380
is an experience of the interdependent origination of all things, and it doesn't mean that there's

1011
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:21,900
one God.

1012
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:24,700
That's a conceptualization of the experience in retrospect.

1013
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:29,020
You are objectifying that experience when you frame it as, oh, it's all one.

1014
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:30,020
It's Brahman.

1015
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:31,020
Absolutely.

1016
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:36,460
The Anatman teaching of Gotama Buddha is that it's not just no self in terms of your own

1017
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:42,340
personal ego, it's that there can be no entity with an inherent identity such as is imagined

1018
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:44,380
when people use the concept God.

1019
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:48,660
So that's an abstraction from out of that kind of psychedelic experience.

1020
01:25:48,660 --> 01:25:55,900
But that having been said, one of my problems with Sakamuni Buddha is that he lost a sense

1021
01:25:55,900 --> 01:26:00,540
of sociopolitical responsibility by having these experiences.

1022
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:06,260
His pacifism and rejection of the potential for social and political transformation is

1023
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:08,540
an abdication of responsibility.

1024
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:13,100
The man went AWOL, and that's my problem with him.

1025
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:16,020
And I think I make this argument at length in Iranian Leviathan.

1026
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:20,060
I think this is why Darius the Great exiled him to northern India.

1027
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:24,860
I don't think that the biographies we have of Gotama are correct.

1028
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:28,140
I think this was a man involved at a very high level in administration in the Persian

1029
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:29,140
Empire.

1030
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:34,560
He was a Scythian, and he was sent to be a sage in northern India after his death was

1031
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:40,900
faked by Darius, because Darius understood that putting this man in a position of sociopolitical

1032
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:44,500
responsibility would be disastrous to society.

1033
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:50,540
Would you say the sociopolitical responsibility is inherent within the human experience?

1034
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:53,660
Yeah, I agree with Aristotle on that.

1035
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:59,380
I disagree with Aristotle about almost everything, but I agree with Aristotle on that, that as

1036
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:05,540
Aristotle put it, man is a political animal, that one of the mistakes that these people

1037
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:12,980
who, you know, well, people who use a lot of psychedelics, who've had a lot of mind

1038
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:22,180
expanding experiences, they lose sight of the fact that if we're not vigilant about

1039
01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:30,260
developing a constructive and empowering political system, our apathy is going to be used against

1040
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:38,620
us by people who will establish one or another form of tyranny, and will probably ban psychedelics

1041
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:41,140
as part of that tyrannical system, right?

1042
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:47,300
And I mean, look, just take the example of the Buddhists in the cradle of Buddhism, northern

1043
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:51,100
India and, you know, eastern Iran.

1044
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:55,100
Buddhism was wiped out in its cradle by Islam.

1045
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:59,820
I mean, the demolition of the Bamiyan Buddhas was the last act by the Taliban, but that's

1046
01:27:59,820 --> 01:28:08,860
sort of like a, what do you want to call it, like, you know, epitaph of the centuries of

1047
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:14,100
genocidal warfare of Islam against pacifistic Buddhism.

1048
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:20,560
And it shows you the problem with, you know, misinterpreting the states of consciousness

1049
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:31,300
accessible through psychedelics as, you know, as, as, you know, some kind of a, some kind

1050
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:37,820
of an experience that shows you that politics is unimportant or that, you know, somehow

1051
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:43,540
like, you know, it's all about expanding our consciousness and having more experiences

1052
01:28:43,540 --> 01:28:44,540
and all this.

1053
01:28:44,540 --> 01:28:45,540
No, no, no, no, no.

1054
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:51,180
The tyrants are just waiting to put you inside a psychical control system where you're not

1055
01:28:51,180 --> 01:28:56,900
even going to, children won't grow up in a society where they have access to such experiences.

1056
01:28:56,900 --> 01:29:05,420
So you know, this is why I value Plato having taken politics as seriously as he did by comparison

1057
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:07,060
to someone like Gotama Buddha.

1058
01:29:07,060 --> 01:29:11,980
I think they had very similar, similar levels of understanding in terms of ontology and

1059
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:17,500
epistemology, but you know, to me, Plato is the deeper and more serious thinker because

1060
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:20,220
he never lost sight of his socio-political responsibility.

1061
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:25,540
Yeah, it seems to me that it's more about recognition of human nature that, you know,

1062
01:29:25,540 --> 01:29:30,260
without, without war, peace has no meaning and definition whatsoever.

1063
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:31,940
It's just both sides.

1064
01:29:31,940 --> 01:29:35,280
I didn't want to use that term to both sides of the same coin because there is no coin.

1065
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:37,660
It is what it is.

1066
01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:42,300
And what you said about people who, asset heads, as you mentioned, I totally agree with

1067
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:43,300
that.

1068
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:48,580
I don't hang out with anybody who is engaged in this under a lot of those people around,

1069
01:29:48,580 --> 01:29:53,780
mainly because what you said about people who want to use technology to prove the gospel

1070
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:59,540
of Christ, for example, because they've already made a decision about what is enlightenment

1071
01:29:59,540 --> 01:30:05,580
is, what is God is, what God is and all those things, and they're using these kind of substances

1072
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:08,620
basically to confirm a bias.

1073
01:30:08,620 --> 01:30:11,940
So this is not looking for the truth or anything like that.

1074
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:17,500
And I believe that it will get you to a point from which you have to go by yourself without

1075
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:20,140
any kind of a tool, including psychedelics.

1076
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:21,340
You're absolutely spot on.

1077
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:27,420
A lot of people will become deluded and a lot of people use it as, you know, a justification

1078
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:29,480
for just doing nothing.

1079
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:34,500
Another thing is also, and I think this also affects you, that a lot of people like Buddha,

1080
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:39,620
for example, a lot of enlightened people, a lot of mystics, they write books and texts,

1081
01:30:39,620 --> 01:30:45,620
which is the result of a journey that they've been on since they were born, all the experiences

1082
01:30:45,620 --> 01:30:47,060
that they had.

1083
01:30:47,060 --> 01:30:49,940
Reading those books don't make you enlightened.

1084
01:30:49,940 --> 01:30:52,300
Reading those books don't make you knowledgeable.

1085
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:57,340
So this is, I'm sure, something that you also face with, that a lot of people maybe take

1086
01:30:57,340 --> 01:31:01,220
different kind of outtakes.

1087
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:06,040
They have misconceptions about what you're saying, because what you've developed is based

1088
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:09,500
on a one, two, three, four, five, until ten, which is your book.

1089
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:12,640
And people are at one, they're looking at ten, they're like, oh, I got it.

1090
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:15,660
But they have their own biases, their own limitations and everything.

1091
01:31:15,660 --> 01:31:16,660
Sure.

1092
01:31:16,660 --> 01:31:17,980
I mean, that's true.

1093
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:22,260
But look, it's par for the course, especially if you want to get involved in sociopolitics

1094
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:28,620
and activism, you will be badly misinterpreted and misunderstood.

1095
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:31,140
You know, I mean, Nietzsche knew this about his own work.

1096
01:31:31,140 --> 01:31:35,100
He, Nietzsche, you know, had a very small following when he was alive.

1097
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:41,100
I think he sold 300 copies of all of the books he ever wrote during his own lifetime.

1098
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:42,260
That's it.

1099
01:31:42,260 --> 01:31:48,100
And he, but he wrote that someday he would be famous and he was kind of sickened by that

1100
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:54,960
prospect because he also believed that he would be badly misinterpreted, just absolutely

1101
01:31:54,960 --> 01:32:00,980
perverted, grotesquely perverted by his own sister.

1102
01:32:00,980 --> 01:32:04,980
He turned out to be that's right.

1103
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:09,500
Perverted by his own sister in more ways than one, but we won't get into that.

1104
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:12,500
But yeah, so look, it's par for the course.

1105
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:17,300
And if you want to get your hands dirty with political responsibility, you have to be ready

1106
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:22,420
to be misunderstood and to dumb things down and, you know, I mean,

1107
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:26,060
But I think it's also important with respect to spectral revolution that you've been talking

1108
01:32:26,060 --> 01:32:29,940
about that I would ask you if you don't mind to describe it one more time for people who

1109
01:32:29,940 --> 01:32:32,660
didn't hear it the last time you were on the podcast.

1110
01:32:32,660 --> 01:32:36,700
Because it reminded me of what Gore Vidal said, that we don't even know what our cage

1111
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:39,860
looks like because we've never seen it from the outside.

1112
01:32:39,860 --> 01:32:45,160
And so all these terms, all these definitions, good, bad, right, wrong, evil, good, they're

1113
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:51,260
all being defined within this cage, within this frame that has been presented to us as

1114
01:32:51,260 --> 01:32:58,420
a very limited pixel of possible reality within which we can't be controlled, we can't be

1115
01:32:58,420 --> 01:33:02,600
held in line and all those things.

1116
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:09,020
So spectral revolution, you know, plays on the word specter, which is a polyvalent word.

1117
01:33:09,020 --> 01:33:11,820
It has more than one meaning, the word specter.

1118
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:17,700
And I employ all of the meanings of the word specter and this concept of a spectral revolution.

1119
01:33:17,700 --> 01:33:23,620
One sense of the word specter has to do with the spectrum, like the light spectrum, right,

1120
01:33:23,620 --> 01:33:26,060
or electromagnetic spectrum or whatever.

1121
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:36,180
A spectrum is a phenomenon where various points that you might abstract from out of it are

1122
01:33:36,180 --> 01:33:38,780
not really distinct from one another, right?

1123
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:50,040
So it's the idea that all of the categories or entities or qualities that we use to form

1124
01:33:50,040 --> 01:34:01,900
binary oppositions like light and darkness, matter and energy, spirit and the spirit and

1125
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:08,940
the body or the soul and the body, and also ethical categories like good versus evil,

1126
01:34:08,940 --> 01:34:14,580
that these are all terms abstracted from out of a spectrum that's continuous and that there

1127
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:19,500
aren't intrinsically sharp divisions between any of these.

1128
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:24,580
Then there's the sense of specter as what is to come, right?

1129
01:34:24,580 --> 01:34:25,580
Specter is what is to come.

1130
01:34:25,580 --> 01:34:29,660
And this is the sense in which Marx uses the word at the outset of the Communist Manifesto

1131
01:34:29,660 --> 01:34:33,580
when he says there's a specter haunting Europe, the specter of communism.

1132
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:41,460
And so it evokes the idea of process that our cosmos does not have a static and fixed

1133
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:46,980
structure that we live in a world of becoming, that reality is processual.

1134
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:57,460
And this process, ontological process, has everything to do with why binary oppositions

1135
01:34:57,460 --> 01:35:01,780
are our own abstractions and they're not intrinsic to reality, right?

1136
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:07,380
Because when everything is in a state of flux, you also recognize that light becomes darkness

1137
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:12,300
and good becomes evil and vice versa, and matter and spirit are two different phases

1138
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:15,300
of the same phenomenon.

1139
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:22,900
And so that second sense of the spectral as process, as becoming, as what is to come,

1140
01:35:22,900 --> 01:35:29,760
as the future, it is very deeply connected to the first sense of specter as spectrum

1141
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:37,340
that defies all binary oppositions and deconstructs all apparent dichotomies.

1142
01:35:37,340 --> 01:35:40,180
Because the core is quantum, it's not binary.

1143
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:41,180
Exactly.

1144
01:35:41,180 --> 01:35:43,060
It's a probability function.

1145
01:35:43,060 --> 01:35:44,060
It's a superposition.

1146
01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:46,980
It's a superposition.

1147
01:35:46,980 --> 01:35:52,340
And so then the third and final sense of the spectral is, of course, the most obvious one,

1148
01:35:52,340 --> 01:35:53,340
the ghost.

1149
01:35:53,340 --> 01:35:54,340
A specter is a ghost.

1150
01:35:54,340 --> 01:35:59,900
And what I'm putting my finger on is that parapsychological phenomena, the ghostly,

1151
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:10,740
the paranormal, it is a key or a clue to the nature of reality as process and to the spectrum

1152
01:36:10,740 --> 01:36:15,900
from out of which we are abstracting all these binary oppositions and dichotomies.

1153
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:22,180
And so the real potential of a scientific recognition of specters, of ghosts, of paranormal

1154
01:36:22,180 --> 01:36:29,620
phenomena is to be able to deconstruct the putative reality of all these dichotomies,

1155
01:36:29,620 --> 01:36:36,140
of all these abstract polarities and recognize that they're only terms that have a practical

1156
01:36:36,140 --> 01:36:41,420
significance that really have a utilitarian purpose.

1157
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:46,100
And we should not idolize these objectifications that we've created ourselves.

1158
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:53,700
And we should understand that reality is process and that the driving force of everything is

1159
01:36:53,700 --> 01:36:54,700
ultimately evolution.

1160
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:59,140
It's a creative evolutionary force that we need to align ourselves with.

1161
01:36:59,140 --> 01:37:05,580
And that's the deepest philosophical significance of the spectral as the ghostly or the paranormal.

1162
01:37:05,580 --> 01:37:19,900
Not to look at it as, I don't know, a bunch of marvels or wonders to gawk at or whatever.

1163
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:25,980
It's a fundamental transformation of our conception of the nature of reality that's really at

1164
01:37:25,980 --> 01:37:30,660
stake here and taking a philosophical approach to the data of parapsychology.

1165
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:35,920
But then to get into the revolution aspect of spectral revolution, my suggestion throughout

1166
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:42,980
all of my works, beginning in Prometheus and Atlas, is that this recognition of the spectral

1167
01:37:42,980 --> 01:37:50,340
on the deep philosophical level that I just summarized will require the total transformation

1168
01:37:50,340 --> 01:37:53,000
of all of our social and political institutions.

1169
01:37:53,000 --> 01:38:00,060
Because if you're going to admit that ESP is real or that psychokinesis is real, well,

1170
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:08,300
then you're faced with a problem of people telepathically spying on other people, people

1171
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:12,660
using psychokinesis in order to inflict harm on their neighbors.

1172
01:38:12,660 --> 01:38:18,820
And there's no way that you can manage that through the current legal or criminal justice

1173
01:38:18,820 --> 01:38:21,260
system, which is a punitive justice system.

1174
01:38:21,260 --> 01:38:29,580
Its crime is committed and then there's some kind of retroactive justice.

1175
01:38:29,580 --> 01:38:31,260
You can't have that.

1176
01:38:31,260 --> 01:38:38,180
We tried that when witches were accused in Salem and in other places of hexing people.

1177
01:38:38,180 --> 01:38:46,260
And judges back in the Puritan colonies ultimately had them burned at the stake.

1178
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:50,620
If we wind up with the mainstream scientific establishment not only recognizing an ability

1179
01:38:50,620 --> 01:38:57,300
like psychokinesis, but developing training protocols for the cultivation of these abilities

1180
01:38:57,300 --> 01:39:03,380
that would be akin to learning a martial art so that you have large swaths of the population

1181
01:39:03,380 --> 01:39:09,700
cultivating their potential psychokinetic abilities, you also need a type of society

1182
01:39:09,700 --> 01:39:23,500
that's going to be able to discourage the misuse of these abilities.

1183
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:32,580
Because there's really no way to handle that through the kind of punitive justice system

1184
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:33,940
that we have now.

1185
01:39:33,940 --> 01:39:40,820
So what becomes more important than anything else is developing a society so deeply unified

1186
01:39:40,820 --> 01:39:52,300
by an ethos that is based on each individual's recognition of his neighbor's right to live

1187
01:39:52,300 --> 01:40:00,100
and to create and to have spiritual autonomy so that no particular member of this society

1188
01:40:00,100 --> 01:40:07,540
would harbor the kind of ill will within his subconscious that would end up in a misuse

1189
01:40:07,540 --> 01:40:13,060
of psychokinetic ability than after the fact has to be dealt with through a criminal justice

1190
01:40:13,060 --> 01:40:14,060
system.

1191
01:40:14,060 --> 01:40:19,580
You need to make it so that you have people so deeply unified on a psychical level that

1192
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:25,420
they would not even think to harm their neighbor by misusing psychokinesis.

1193
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:28,780
But of course then that presents you with the challenge of preserving the individual

1194
01:40:28,780 --> 01:40:33,060
and making sure that the individual is not subsumed into some kind of a hive mind or

1195
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:36,540
collective consciousness.

1196
01:40:36,540 --> 01:40:41,480
Whether or not this is something that can be achieved through genetic engineering.

1197
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:42,480
Very dangerous.

1198
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:54,900
I mean because you do not want to in any way eliminate the genetic correlates of human

1199
01:40:54,900 --> 01:40:59,860
individuality from out of the genome or even compromise them.

1200
01:40:59,860 --> 01:41:08,300
And so I think more what's needed is the cultivation of a spiritual ethos and the development of

1201
01:41:08,300 --> 01:41:17,580
the core of a new society of spiritually resilient individuals who are free spirited enough to

1202
01:41:17,580 --> 01:41:21,420
want to see their fellow man flourish.

1203
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:24,140
That's really what's needed.

1204
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:30,220
And yeah it's a tall order and you know I'm afraid to say that you know given the time

1205
01:41:30,220 --> 01:41:35,580
constraints that we face there's just no way that you know you're going to be able to transform

1206
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:38,540
the majority of humanity in that fashion.

1207
01:41:38,540 --> 01:41:48,540
So really it's a question of developing you know a model society, the nucleus of a new

1208
01:41:48,540 --> 01:41:56,180
society and then defending it like a you know citadel against any and every potential enemy.

1209
01:41:56,180 --> 01:41:58,660
Absolutely, absolutely.

1210
01:41:58,660 --> 01:42:06,420
I'm not optimistic but this is a noble thought and concept to thrive for.

1211
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:07,420
Absolutely.

1212
01:42:07,420 --> 01:42:08,420
And that's where you have to begin.

1213
01:42:08,420 --> 01:42:11,660
People can look at me as a naive idealist, fine what are you doing?

1214
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:13,380
I mean come up with a better plan.

1215
01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:17,140
It begins with an idea, it's an idea.

1216
01:42:17,140 --> 01:42:20,860
You know if the right people are convinced by that idea something can actually happen.

1217
01:42:20,860 --> 01:42:26,460
There are people with resources who understand the nature of the problem and if they haven't

1218
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:29,580
done anything better right now well don't blame them.

1219
01:42:29,580 --> 01:42:31,300
They haven't been shown a better idea.

1220
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:36,060
You have to present them with an alternative vision that's viable and you know that they

1221
01:42:36,060 --> 01:42:42,100
might prefer to the current modus operandi right, the de facto program.

1222
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:47,260
And then perhaps if you could convince enough of those people it will go from being an idea

1223
01:42:47,260 --> 01:42:49,460
into a program.

1224
01:42:49,460 --> 01:42:51,500
Absolutely.

1225
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:55,660
Well I never thought of you as a naive idealist or anything like that just to put it out there.

1226
01:42:55,660 --> 01:43:03,380
I see you as a incredibly as I said unique and a valuable asset to humanity.

1227
01:43:03,380 --> 01:43:09,300
And I have to say that I was completely disconnected with Iranian, everything coming from Iran

1228
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:10,300
because I grew up there.

1229
01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:15,620
You know I lived there for 23 years, I went to school and I didn't want to have anything

1230
01:43:15,620 --> 01:43:16,620
to do with it.

1231
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:22,420
It was until we spoke the first time that I went back and read and listened to some

1232
01:43:22,420 --> 01:43:27,180
of your material on Iran and Persian Empire and the philosophy behind it.

1233
01:43:27,180 --> 01:43:30,260
I actually feel good about being from that country.

1234
01:43:30,260 --> 01:43:35,740
So I think this is a disservice that your books are not being taught at Iranian schools

1235
01:43:35,740 --> 01:43:41,340
because it's not like well I guess it's against Islam but that's the order that everybody

1236
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:46,060
will be very lucky if it's replaced by something like Prometheism.

1237
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:54,660
Look I'll go I mean and I hate to end on this note but I have a lot of problems with the

1238
01:43:54,660 --> 01:43:58,620
government of the Islamic Republic okay but I actually I cannot blame the Islamic Republic

1239
01:43:58,620 --> 01:44:02,180
for the fact that my works are not circulating in Persian and Iran.

1240
01:44:02,180 --> 01:44:13,140
I was involved with a group of people in the Iranian opposition who had enough resources

1241
01:44:13,140 --> 01:44:17,020
to be able to ensure that all my writings were translated into Persian and we could

1242
01:44:17,020 --> 01:44:22,580
have had them widely disseminated in Iran but let's just put it this way after working

1243
01:44:22,580 --> 01:44:29,060
with them for a number of years I see why for 40 years the so-called opposition hasn't

1244
01:44:29,060 --> 01:44:32,900
been able to overthrow this regime.

1245
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:38,380
They can't even get one thinker's writings competently translated and circulated in the

1246
01:44:38,380 --> 01:44:43,740
country let alone rival you know the power of the Revolutionary Guard and its military

1247
01:44:43,740 --> 01:44:45,660
industrial complex.

1248
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:53,460
So I think that there's potential for transformation from within Iran itself over the longer term

1249
01:44:53,460 --> 01:45:05,620
and that Iran is very important in terms of the larger Islamic civilizational sphere and

1250
01:45:05,620 --> 01:45:12,340
ensuring that you know the Middle East and Central Asia are not subsumed by this global

1251
01:45:12,340 --> 01:45:16,940
totalitarian system that's being planned right now.

1252
01:45:16,940 --> 01:45:25,220
That you know at a key moment Iran could act as a kind of Promethean force of resistance

1253
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:31,540
from within that whole civilizational sphere and internally transform itself while at the

1254
01:45:31,540 --> 01:45:37,700
same time maintaining its force projection capability and acting as a kind of bastion

1255
01:45:37,700 --> 01:45:45,900
of resistance from within the quote-unquote Islamic world and throwing a huge monkey wrench

1256
01:45:45,900 --> 01:45:49,820
in you know the plan to basically subjugate the planet.

1257
01:45:49,820 --> 01:45:54,060
I completely agree with you and this is an agreement that has been developed over the

1258
01:45:54,060 --> 01:45:58,500
past maybe a year or over the past couple of months that I went from Iran should not

1259
01:45:58,500 --> 01:46:04,780
have for example access to nuclear weapons to thinking to myself why wouldn't Iranian

1260
01:46:04,780 --> 01:46:09,180
government want to have a nuclear weapon and a couple of them considering the world order

1261
01:46:09,180 --> 01:46:11,220
and where they're placed at this point.

1262
01:46:11,220 --> 01:46:12,220
I totally agree with you.

1263
01:46:12,220 --> 01:46:18,140
You see like listen the people in Tehran watching this right now whatever you know people I'm

1264
01:46:18,140 --> 01:46:22,220
doing your work for you there are a lot of people by the way they think like somehow

1265
01:46:22,220 --> 01:46:25,740
I work for you know I'm somehow in cahoots with Iranian intelligence whatever the only

1266
01:46:25,740 --> 01:46:30,020
involvement with the Iranian intelligence I've had is that they cyber hacked me they

1267
01:46:30,020 --> 01:46:35,180
monitor all my stuff they've done it for years whatever but they should watch this right

1268
01:46:35,180 --> 01:46:41,740
now and see that you know anyway whatever I hope that nationalists within the IRGC really

1269
01:46:41,740 --> 01:46:47,300
take seriously the responsibility that they have to their own to their own heritage and

1270
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:51,460
to the rest of the world and understand what kind of a transition needs to take place there

1271
01:46:51,460 --> 01:46:53,460
sooner rather than later.

1272
01:46:53,460 --> 01:47:00,420
Excellent, you gave a message to Iran and Iranians and I want you to finish again thank

1273
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:04,620
you so much for this time it's such a pleasure having you on this podcast I hope that it

1274
01:47:04,620 --> 01:47:08,500
can happen maybe once every year or something like that until we hit the single.

1275
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:10,540
It's always my pleasure anytime.

1276
01:47:10,540 --> 01:47:11,540
Yeah likewise.

1277
01:47:11,540 --> 01:47:18,180
Dr. Georgiani's book is Closer Encounters go and buy it and support this man all across

1278
01:47:18,180 --> 01:47:20,280
social media and everywhere.

1279
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:26,140
You mentioned the message to Iran and Iranians let's end the program with a message to humanity

1280
01:47:26,140 --> 01:47:31,580
and the world.

1281
01:47:31,580 --> 01:47:40,540
Let me quote Nietzsche, man is a tightrope between ape and over man.

1282
01:47:40,540 --> 01:47:49,260
A tightrope is not somewhere you want to stay okay it is not a stable place there is no

1283
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:57,660
human nature that defines the limits of what we can be in the way that various animals

1284
01:47:57,660 --> 01:48:03,740
have a species being that they can't do anything about as you put it earlier in our conversation

1285
01:48:03,740 --> 01:48:09,780
the quote unquote nature of man is inextricable from technology and technological development.

1286
01:48:09,780 --> 01:48:17,020
Technology made us we were technological before we were human the use of technology by primates

1287
01:48:17,020 --> 01:48:20,900
is what created the human being.

1288
01:48:20,900 --> 01:48:26,940
And so my message to humanity is that it's out it's time for us to outgrow ourselves

1289
01:48:26,940 --> 01:48:30,260
okay it is time to take an evolutionary leap.

1290
01:48:30,260 --> 01:48:37,740
We are at a bottleneck in our development right now where either we have to go backwards

1291
01:48:37,740 --> 01:48:49,860
into a neo feudal frankly retarded agrarian civilization where we have to face forcible

1292
01:48:49,860 --> 01:48:56,060
deindustrialization because certain elites consider us incapable of bearing the responsibility

1293
01:48:56,060 --> 01:49:01,580
of navigating the technological singularity or we have to be prepared to take this evolutionary

1294
01:49:01,580 --> 01:49:13,260
leap into a form of individuality and a type of society that is superhuman or post human

1295
01:49:13,260 --> 01:49:21,780
and everyone has to make a choice it's your choice you know which side of this battle

1296
01:49:21,780 --> 01:49:28,060
you want to stand on whether you want to align yourself with the force of evolution and progress

1297
01:49:28,060 --> 01:49:33,420
or whether you want to be a vehicle for the retardation of the planet and I put that choice

1298
01:49:33,420 --> 01:49:40,140
before every human being to basically transcend and outgrow mere humanity or to be reduced

1299
01:49:40,140 --> 01:49:46,700
to something like an ape right man is a tightrope between ape and overman you either have to

1300
01:49:46,700 --> 01:50:05,340
walk backwards or you have to walk forward this is not a place we can stay indefinitely
