00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Man is a tightrope between ape and overman.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.960
A tightrope is not somewhere you want to stay, okay?

00:11.960 --> 00:15.020
It is not a stable place.

00:15.020 --> 00:23.640
There is no human nature that defines the limits of what we can be in the way that various

00:23.640 --> 00:27.880
animals have a species being that they can't do anything about.

00:27.880 --> 00:33.020
As you put it earlier in our conversation, the quote unquote nature of man is inextricable

00:33.020 --> 00:36.260
from technology and technological development.

00:36.260 --> 00:38.140
Technology made us.

00:38.140 --> 00:41.720
We were technological before we were human.

00:41.720 --> 00:49.240
The use of technology by primates is what created the human being.

00:49.240 --> 00:59.360
Dr. Georgiani, welcome back to Neohuman Podcast, less than a year ago, but few episodes apart

00:59.360 --> 01:03.480
because I haven't done too many of these podcasts.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.480
Welcome.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.920
It's a pleasure to be with you again, Agha.

01:06.920 --> 01:07.920
Yeah, absolutely.

01:07.920 --> 01:08.920
How have you been?

01:08.920 --> 01:13.600
I believe you're back in New York, New York City, which for the reasons that maybe we

01:13.600 --> 01:17.800
get to it, I consider it to be the capital of woke at this point or whatever that is

01:17.800 --> 01:22.640
going on philosophically and spiritually on the other side.

01:22.640 --> 01:23.640
How have you been?

01:23.640 --> 01:27.320
How are you dealing with all these limitations and restrictions and everything that's been

01:27.320 --> 01:29.920
happening since the last time that we spoke?

01:29.920 --> 01:39.160
Well, it's hard and it affects me deeply.

01:39.160 --> 01:43.280
The weather is still nice here, so in terms of restaurants, I can sit outside and not

01:43.280 --> 01:49.680
have to submit to the vaccine mandate, but that's not the issue.

01:49.680 --> 01:55.800
What's the issue is that I see the city that I grew up in and that I love being totally

01:55.800 --> 02:01.480
destroyed, having its character completely deformed.

02:01.480 --> 02:04.720
This is not the spirit of New York.

02:04.720 --> 02:12.020
New York was the toughest, grittiest city in the country, if not the world.

02:12.020 --> 02:18.920
To see this kind of cowering and fearfulness, I mean, I don't know what happened to New

02:18.920 --> 02:19.920
Yorkers.

02:19.920 --> 02:22.820
I don't know who these people are that surround me right now.

02:22.820 --> 02:27.360
But what I tell people when they say, you should move to the South or you should move

02:27.360 --> 02:32.620
to Eastern Europe or whatever, is that I have the kind of relationship to this city that

02:32.620 --> 02:35.400
Socrates had to Athens.

02:35.400 --> 02:41.080
I will probably die here before I abandon my post.

02:41.080 --> 02:43.160
So we'll see what happens.

02:43.160 --> 02:50.840
But New York, to me, is a city like Babylon once was, like Rome was.

02:50.840 --> 02:56.360
It's a city that may die many times but come back with a vengeance.

02:56.360 --> 03:05.720
And I do think that our worst days are probably ahead of us, but that this city will rise

03:05.720 --> 03:09.440
from out of the waters and from out of the waves and from out of the ashes.

03:09.440 --> 03:12.160
And it will be a phoenix.

03:12.160 --> 03:17.660
Yeah, I think it's important to consider because a lot of people are saying that these people

03:17.660 --> 03:22.400
are incompetent, that anything that they touch turns into dust and trash.

03:22.400 --> 03:27.800
But it's also, I think, important to consider that this could all be intentional as a matter

03:27.800 --> 03:32.840
of treason that people who are pushing these cities to fall apart are doing it just so

03:32.840 --> 03:35.200
they can buy the dip, basically.

03:35.200 --> 03:40.360
Everything crashes and these people in New York, de Blasio and his people, just buying

03:40.360 --> 03:47.620
up the city and creating this kind of centrally driven hub of whatever kind of a social experiment

03:47.620 --> 03:51.960
that they want to force upon the people.

03:51.960 --> 03:57.800
You know, I don't mean to say something so out there, so early in our conversation, but

03:57.800 --> 04:05.760
I can't stop myself in response to the question or in response to what you just said.

04:05.760 --> 04:11.860
I have known some of the top remote viewers, people who worked at the Stanford Research

04:11.860 --> 04:18.840
Institute program that was funded by the CIA and then by the DOD to gather intelligence

04:18.840 --> 04:21.720
using extrasensory perception.

04:21.720 --> 04:26.920
And one of the things that these people would do is they would look at future events and

04:26.920 --> 04:32.880
they did that for counterterrorism purposes and other objectives of the US government.

04:32.880 --> 04:40.880
But sometimes they would just engage in remote viewing targets decades into the future, particularly

04:40.880 --> 04:46.120
having to do with anticipating and preparing for natural catastrophes and so forth.

04:46.120 --> 04:53.220
And one person that I spoke with at some length was the trainer for the entire CIA remote

04:53.220 --> 04:54.840
viewing program.

04:54.840 --> 04:59.200
And he and his group had actually remote viewed the year 2050.

04:59.200 --> 05:05.000
And they had seen that all of the cities were emptied out and people were living on isolated

05:05.000 --> 05:10.160
neo-agrarian homesteads in the countryside.

05:10.160 --> 05:16.460
And when I asked him why this was the case, he said that they were terrified of disease

05:16.460 --> 05:22.080
and they did not allow anyone other than their close friends and family onto their property.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.680
And so the cities were still there.

05:23.680 --> 05:26.040
It's not like there had been a nuclear war.

05:26.040 --> 05:30.080
And in fact, he said that criminals lived in the cities because it was a place where

05:30.080 --> 05:34.240
you could evade surveillance and control.

05:34.240 --> 05:37.600
They were like squatting in the cities.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.480
But the cities were otherwise emptied out.

05:39.480 --> 05:46.920
And so I think that you're right that on even a much higher level or in a much more nefarious

05:46.920 --> 05:51.080
way than you suggested, this is all being done very deliberately.

05:51.080 --> 05:58.720
And New York City in particular is being targeted as sort of the beta test for this entire program

05:58.720 --> 06:04.560
because New York City is potentially such a bastion of resistance against the kind of

06:04.560 --> 06:07.200
world order that they want to bring.

06:07.200 --> 06:11.360
I know a lot of people on the right don't see it that way, but I think they lack a long

06:11.360 --> 06:15.840
view of history and they lack an understanding of the nuances of the character of the city.

06:15.840 --> 06:21.440
This could become a bastion of mass resistance against the certain, this place could become

06:21.440 --> 06:26.800
a bastion of mass resistance against the kind of totalitarian regime that they want to ultimately

06:26.800 --> 06:29.120
unfold on a planetary scale.

06:29.120 --> 06:33.320
And so I think that their first objective has to be to destroy cities like New York

06:33.320 --> 06:38.520
and to isolate people as much as possible, to make it so that all of their communication

06:38.520 --> 06:44.620
is through cyberspace, which is a medium that they control entirely, and make it harder

06:44.620 --> 06:48.220
for people to gather en masse, you know, face to face.

06:48.220 --> 06:50.560
So yes, I'm very concerned about that.

06:50.560 --> 06:53.200
So let's stay on New York for a second.

06:53.200 --> 06:56.840
I want to talk to you about your book, obviously, but I think this is very important and it

06:56.840 --> 07:00.860
could be even related as you already make some kind of a connection.

07:00.860 --> 07:06.320
This cancel culture that has been taking out statues and canceling people, they've replaced

07:06.320 --> 07:10.840
all those things by one thing, as far as I know, and that is one statue that they put

07:10.840 --> 07:18.520
in New York in the Rockefeller Center called, called the Oracle, which is this massive,

07:18.520 --> 07:24.040
I don't know if it's still there, it's this massive black figure who's holding a flame.

07:24.040 --> 07:25.840
And this is significant.

07:25.840 --> 07:30.040
And I really wanted to talk to you about it for a month, because this is happening at

07:30.040 --> 07:34.720
the same place that there was a statue of Prometheus that has been placed there, I would

07:34.720 --> 07:37.480
assume for you as the founder of Prometheism.

07:37.480 --> 07:44.200
This place should be a sacred place that I don't even know what kind of a term to use

07:44.200 --> 07:50.080
violated or whatever, but I think this is extremely important to understand where these

07:50.080 --> 07:53.940
people are coming from spiritually, philosophically.

07:53.940 --> 07:56.800
And so please tell me what you think about that.

07:56.800 --> 08:01.080
How do you see it and whether or not this statue is still there and what is the significance

08:01.080 --> 08:03.880
of it all?

08:03.880 --> 08:11.440
What they did is not some, you know, kitsch art industry gimmick.

08:11.440 --> 08:17.760
This was done very deliberately and I'll explain to you why I know that's the case.

08:17.760 --> 08:24.080
If you look at this monstrosity that they set up at the opening of, at the opening,

08:24.080 --> 08:29.160
the mouth of Rockefeller Plaza, right, so that when you stand in front of this quote

08:29.160 --> 08:34.120
unquote oracle, it blocks the view of the Prometheus statue and the entire plaza.

08:34.120 --> 08:36.680
You can't see anything of what's behind it.

08:36.680 --> 08:43.000
It towers in front of you, blocks that majestic architectural design and the sculpture of

08:43.000 --> 08:45.320
Prometheus that the plaza leads down to.

08:45.320 --> 08:47.520
Is it still there?

08:47.520 --> 08:48.520
You know what?

08:48.520 --> 08:52.120
To tell you the truth, I was so appalled that I haven't been back there since I really could

08:52.120 --> 08:56.080
not bring myself to go back there, because as you said, to me, it's a sacred place.

08:56.080 --> 09:01.000
And you know, if you notice the title of my first book, Prometheus and Atlas, it comes

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
from the fact that there's a statue of Prometheus and a statue of Atlas at Rockefeller Plaza.

09:07.000 --> 09:13.520
And the opening paragraph of Prometheus and Atlas evokes that place as a kind of, you

09:13.520 --> 09:16.520
know, navel of the world.

09:16.520 --> 09:20.480
And so I have not been able to bring myself to go back there since.

09:20.480 --> 09:23.240
Hopefully by the time I do, that will have been removed.

09:23.240 --> 09:30.280
In any case, if you look at the symbolism of this statue, he has the torch of Prometheus

09:30.280 --> 09:32.240
in his hand.

09:32.240 --> 09:41.040
So this figure has stolen the fire back from Prometheus and this figure has an African

09:41.040 --> 09:45.880
mask on, but it's actually Zeus.

09:45.880 --> 09:55.040
Zeus enthroned, wearing an African mask, having stolen the fire back from Prometheus.

09:55.040 --> 10:01.320
So what this statue actually means, and this is lost on the BLM ninis who are celebrating

10:01.320 --> 10:08.000
it, is that Zeus, the tyrannical godfather, head of the caste system, head of the system

10:08.000 --> 10:15.080
of slavery and oppression and, you know, racial hierarchy and so on and so forth, is using

10:15.080 --> 10:25.480
a black mask to steal the fire of liberation back from us rebels in order to refound that

10:25.480 --> 10:32.680
system of oppression and take his throne again, but this time wearing the mask of social justice.

10:32.680 --> 10:34.800
That's what that sculpture actually means.

10:34.800 --> 10:38.400
So it's not even a head because a lot of people were like deformed head, giant head.

10:38.400 --> 10:39.400
It is a mask.

10:39.400 --> 10:48.680
It's a traditional African mask on Zeus's face and the figure is Zeus on his throne.

10:48.680 --> 10:53.240
The sculpture of Prometheus at Rockefeller Center is about Prometheus challenging the

10:53.240 --> 10:59.760
throne of Zeus and stealing the fire of the light of scientific knowledge and the forge

10:59.760 --> 11:03.800
of technological innovation, stealing that fire from Olympus and giving it as a gift

11:03.800 --> 11:06.240
to mankind for the sake of human empowerment.

11:06.240 --> 11:09.560
That's what the sculpture of Prometheus is about and in fact, there's a quote from Aeschylus

11:09.560 --> 11:14.320
above that sculpture in Rockefeller Plaza that makes it very explicit, right?

11:14.320 --> 11:19.240
Whereas this monstrosity they put there to block the view of the Prometheus statue is

11:19.240 --> 11:23.840
about putting Zeus back on his throne again and making sure that the fire is taken from

11:23.840 --> 11:28.680
us, all justified by an African mask.

11:28.680 --> 11:30.160
Wow.

11:30.160 --> 11:35.680
When you say they, who exactly are you referring to?

11:35.680 --> 11:44.040
We're elites who are using Black Lives Matter as a vehicle in order to establish a system

11:44.040 --> 11:51.900
where knowledge is secreted away and hidden from us again and where there's basically

11:51.900 --> 11:59.960
a neo-agrarian feudal state put into place to keep masses obedient, submissive and ignorant.

11:59.960 --> 12:05.640
Yes, centralized interests basically, which is global.

12:05.640 --> 12:06.640
Hierarchical and centralized.

12:06.640 --> 12:07.640
Right.

12:07.640 --> 12:09.080
Hierarchical and centralized.

12:09.080 --> 12:13.520
So I think this is a good pathway to get into your new book, Congratulations, by the way,

12:13.520 --> 12:20.760
Closer Encounters that came out I believe in August and it's been a number one in a

12:20.760 --> 12:23.320
variety of categories on Amazon.

12:23.320 --> 12:29.400
I'm showing the hardcover page of Amazon but it's also available in paperback and audiobook

12:29.400 --> 12:31.680
maybe it's also available?

12:31.680 --> 12:32.680
Not yet.

12:32.680 --> 12:33.680
Hopefully soon.

12:33.680 --> 12:35.600
I'll get Artos working on that.

12:35.600 --> 12:42.240
So let's talk about your intention for writing this book now and then we get to whether or

12:42.240 --> 12:46.680
not there is some kind of a grand intention or grand plan and objective that is being

12:46.680 --> 12:54.880
played on this planet and beyond this planet that it's all basically coming unmasked in

12:54.880 --> 12:57.040
this period that we're experiencing.

12:57.040 --> 12:58.040
Right.

12:58.040 --> 13:05.200
So the prompt for my finally writing about this subject after having studied it for 20

13:05.200 --> 13:11.240
years on the side of everything else that I've been doing was the UAP report, which

13:11.240 --> 13:20.120
we knew from late last year that it was going to be released this summer and I correctly

13:20.120 --> 13:27.320
anticipated that this report would be a monstrous lie.

13:27.320 --> 13:38.640
And so I wanted to make sure to synthesize and crystallize my own interpretation and

13:38.640 --> 13:45.180
reflections on close encounters and have it ready as a response to this deception that's

13:45.180 --> 13:46.360
being promulgated.

13:46.360 --> 13:51.520
This is a report about UFO that the US government released after a lot of anticipation and build

13:51.520 --> 13:53.320
up basically.

13:53.320 --> 13:54.320
That's right.

13:54.320 --> 13:58.920
UAP preliminary assessment is what it was called.

13:58.920 --> 14:07.620
And look, the mandate for this report, which came from Congress and was spearheaded by

14:07.620 --> 14:16.720
people like Marco Rubio from the perspective of national security because our highest level

14:16.720 --> 14:26.320
naval assets were being overflown on a regular basis by these unidentified vehicles.

14:26.320 --> 14:35.680
The mandate of this report was that all intelligence that the Navy, the Air Force and whatever

14:35.680 --> 14:42.720
other branch of the US government had on these quote unquote unidentified aerial phenomena

14:42.720 --> 14:49.080
ought to be volunteered to Congress and an assessment should be made as to what these

14:49.080 --> 14:51.720
phenomena are.

14:51.720 --> 15:03.140
And when we got the actual report, we saw that first of all, they limited the database

15:03.140 --> 15:09.640
upon which they based their conclusions to a period starting from the early 2000s until

15:09.640 --> 15:11.440
the present.

15:11.440 --> 15:20.160
Secondly, although the mandate specifically instructed the Office of Naval Intelligence,

15:20.160 --> 15:25.600
because most of these sightings recently have involved US aircraft carriers and other naval

15:25.600 --> 15:30.680
vessels, specifically instructed Office of Naval Intelligence to hand over everything

15:30.680 --> 15:34.400
it knew about UFOs.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.840
None of that is acknowledged in this report.

15:36.840 --> 15:43.520
The Office of Naval Intelligence has an archive going back 70 years, full of hundreds and

15:43.520 --> 15:51.760
hundreds of UFO reports, including reports of what they call USOs, unidentified submersible

15:51.760 --> 15:55.980
or submarine objects, which are UFOs that come up from out of the water or go back down

15:55.980 --> 15:57.880
into the oceans.

15:57.880 --> 16:04.160
And they've tracked these things going at incredible speeds on sonar from submarines.

16:04.160 --> 16:10.320
They have hundreds of reports going back decades, and many of them have already been made public.

16:10.320 --> 16:17.920
And yet, in this UAP report and this UAP preliminary assessment, they refuse to acknowledge any

16:17.920 --> 16:18.920
of that.

16:18.920 --> 16:24.120
It's as if this thing only started happening in the early 2000s.

16:24.120 --> 16:27.560
And they make some brief mention of how, well, previously, we kind of noticed some things

16:27.560 --> 16:29.480
that we didn't really have any good data yet.

16:29.480 --> 16:30.480
Well, bullshit.

16:30.480 --> 16:35.040
So, first of all, they're covering up 70 years of their own data.

16:35.040 --> 16:43.360
Second, this report is a disaster from the standpoint of national security for the following

16:43.360 --> 16:45.840
reason.

16:45.840 --> 16:52.840
Up until now, it's been assumed since the Condon report, the concluded Project Bluebook

16:52.840 --> 16:59.120
in 1969, where the University of Colorado came in and under the chairmanship of Professor

16:59.120 --> 17:05.280
Condon did an assessment of the Bluebook data, since that report in 1969, it's been assumed

17:05.280 --> 17:11.940
by, I don't know, the general public, but also by the governments of our adversaries

17:11.940 --> 17:16.500
that the United States has secretly not only been studying this phenomenon, but perhaps

17:16.500 --> 17:20.280
the Pentagon has been reverse engineering technology, right?

17:20.280 --> 17:23.480
So the impression is, well, you know, the Americans know what's...

17:23.480 --> 17:27.920
Not only do they know what's going on, they're probably developing some deterrence capability

17:27.920 --> 17:29.560
with respect to UFOs.

17:29.560 --> 17:32.160
This is the impression by Russians and Chinese and...

17:32.160 --> 17:33.520
Russians, Chinese, right?

17:33.520 --> 17:35.280
And that's the impression we will want them to have.

17:35.280 --> 17:39.160
You want your adversaries to believe that A, not only do you know what it is, B, you're

17:39.160 --> 17:43.480
developing countermeasures and perhaps you have technology based on it that could outmaneuver

17:43.480 --> 17:47.840
them in any war.

17:47.840 --> 17:52.920
So this report comes out and it says, well, gee, you know, we actually don't know what

17:52.920 --> 17:54.120
these things are.

17:54.120 --> 17:58.960
Some significant percentage of these are genuinely unidentified, not only unidentified, they're

17:58.960 --> 18:00.820
unidentifiable.

18:00.820 --> 18:04.840
No matter what we bring to bear on analyzing this, we don't know what these things are.

18:04.840 --> 18:09.140
They outperform all of the military hardware that we have and folks, they're not manufactured

18:09.140 --> 18:10.140
by us.

18:10.140 --> 18:15.080
And by the way, it could be Russia or China.

18:15.080 --> 18:20.840
How stupid are you from a national security perspective that you come out and say that

18:20.840 --> 18:26.200
publicly, even if it were true, which it isn't.

18:26.200 --> 18:30.360
You don't say that when you're responsible for the security of the nation.

18:30.360 --> 18:31.360
Right?

18:31.360 --> 18:36.200
I mean, this country has a larger military budget than the next 10 countries put together,

18:36.200 --> 18:37.720
including Russia and China.

18:37.720 --> 18:42.640
You mean to tell the American taxpayer, right, a trillion dollars, you know, of their money

18:42.640 --> 18:46.200
of which you just burned in Afghanistan, but that's another issue.

18:46.200 --> 18:49.560
You mean to tell the American taxpayer that with that kind of military budget that they're

18:49.560 --> 18:56.320
funding, maybe China and Russia have manufactured these vehicles that are doing end runs around

18:56.320 --> 19:00.800
our Air Force, you know, jets and our aircraft carriers.

19:00.800 --> 19:08.460
And we're completely, you know, we are subject to the penetration of our most secure air

19:08.460 --> 19:11.620
space with impunity by these objects.

19:11.620 --> 19:14.680
And you're leaving open the possibility that they're actually hardware manufactured by

19:14.680 --> 19:15.680
our adversaries.

19:15.680 --> 19:24.240
That's a does that look the U.S. government, frankly, has lost legitimacy over that alone.

19:24.240 --> 19:27.580
That is an abdication of the sovereignty of the United States in and of itself, regardless

19:27.580 --> 19:28.960
of any other factors.

19:28.960 --> 19:33.200
I mean, what is even the meaning of U.S. government now?

19:33.200 --> 19:38.460
Because you're saying national security interests, but the interests of certain people within

19:38.460 --> 19:45.240
the so-called U.S. government is completely different and not aligned at all with absolute

19:45.240 --> 19:46.920
majority of Americans.

19:46.920 --> 19:50.200
I mean, how can you mess up so badly in Afghanistan?

19:50.200 --> 19:55.720
And then the only place that you've had a plan and schedule and everything for was to

19:55.720 --> 20:02.080
bring tens of thousands of Afghanis without being vetted into U.S. soil and into the U.S.

20:02.080 --> 20:03.080
territory.

20:03.080 --> 20:11.680
I mean, it's so obvious that this is not a group of people who are collecting taxpayers

20:11.680 --> 20:16.720
money, hard-earned money, while looking down at them and serving some other interests.

20:16.720 --> 20:22.520
I don't know if they're bought out by the Chinese or whoever, but they're definitely

20:22.520 --> 20:27.640
not aligned with the interests of America as you and I and a lot of other people would

20:27.640 --> 20:33.480
consider that term to have any kind of a definition of meaning, America.

20:33.480 --> 20:40.820
Look, tomorrow is September 11th, tomorrow.

20:40.820 --> 20:51.400
You know, in the past 20 years in Afghanistan, the United States has supposedly been fighting

20:51.400 --> 20:56.280
the Taliban and supposedly been trying to build a relatively secular Afghan civilian

20:56.280 --> 21:00.440
government and give education to women and so on and so forth, right?

21:00.440 --> 21:03.640
This is the story that we're told.

21:03.640 --> 21:11.280
But if you actually go back to the beginning of the Afghan Civil War in 1978-79, you see

21:11.280 --> 21:18.160
that what the United States did was they set up a base in Pakistan, the Arabic name of

21:18.160 --> 21:29.280
which was Al-Qaeda, the base, and they brought Saudis and other Salafis and Wahabis to Pakistan

21:29.280 --> 21:36.800
and sent them via Waziristan into Afghanistan to fight not just against the Soviet Union,

21:36.800 --> 21:42.600
but to dominate other factions of the Afghan resistance like the Northern Alliance that

21:42.600 --> 21:44.560
was led by Ahmad Shah Massoud.

21:44.560 --> 21:51.240
One, I don't know, it was, what was it, within days, I think, of 9-11, the CIA assassinated

21:51.240 --> 21:55.880
Ahmad Shah Massoud in Afghanistan to make sure that the Northern Alliance would not be a

21:55.880 --> 22:01.360
viable force once the US became engaged in Afghanistan.

22:01.360 --> 22:05.320
And so instead of fighting the Taliban for the past 20 years, which is the facade that's

22:05.320 --> 22:10.880
been presented to us, what the United States did not just over the last 20 years, but frankly

22:10.880 --> 22:17.160
since the beginning of the Afghan Civil War, is it took a group of uneducated, poorly organized

22:17.160 --> 22:26.320
Talibs, religious students, mercenary religious students, and it put them on steroids by bringing

22:26.320 --> 22:31.920
well-funded, well-armed Saudi and other Salafist forces into Afghanistan and creating this

22:31.920 --> 22:38.660
super Taliban, which it has now successfully taken over the whole country, with US weapons

22:38.660 --> 22:53.540
and equipment and...conveniently paid $85 billion to arm this mock-up Afghan military

22:53.540 --> 22:58.300
that would then lay down all of its hardware, its attack helicopters, its tanks, everything,

22:58.300 --> 23:02.440
so that the Taliban could be armed to the teeth with state-of-the-art American military

23:02.440 --> 23:09.320
hardware paid for by the taxpayer, the same taxpayer that is being told that maybe China

23:09.320 --> 23:13.840
and Russia are manufacturing flying saucers that outperform anything that our Air Force

23:13.840 --> 23:14.840
and our Navy have.

23:14.840 --> 23:16.640
What kind of government is this?

23:16.640 --> 23:17.640
Yeah.

23:17.640 --> 23:24.100
Yeah, I think a lot of people are asking that question now, which is, you know, it's terrible

23:24.100 --> 23:29.280
what's happening, but it's also kind of in some kind of a desperate, twisted way, maybe

23:29.280 --> 23:36.720
it can be seen as a silver lining, because when they're becoming so covert and so aggressive,

23:36.720 --> 23:43.000
so obviously, it just shows to me, at least, that they're desperate and their narrative

23:43.000 --> 23:49.200
is falling apart, and therefore they're just using intimidation and force and coercion

23:49.200 --> 23:53.160
to force people to follow the narrative.

23:53.160 --> 23:55.460
You know, I wish that were true.

23:55.460 --> 23:58.000
I would love that to be the case.

23:58.000 --> 24:05.160
Unfortunately, I think that what's actually going on is that there's a deliberate attempt

24:05.160 --> 24:09.240
being made to dismantle the United States, and we've talked about this in other contexts.

24:09.240 --> 24:18.920
I think that from 1945 to 1947, when we brought over those thousands of, you know, the brightest,

24:18.920 --> 24:26.480
most industrious Nazis that Germany produced, and we embedded them at the deepest layers

24:26.480 --> 24:32.680
of what became the military industrial complex, and we went and imported the entire East German,

24:32.680 --> 24:37.880
I'm sorry, the entire East European spy network of Nazi Germany, the Galen Organization, into

24:37.880 --> 24:45.680
the OSS and created the CIA, we wound up with a deep state in this country that never owed

24:45.680 --> 24:47.960
its allegiance to the American people.

24:47.960 --> 24:53.780
The objective of that, frankly, fascist deep state was to destroy the Soviet Union.

24:53.780 --> 25:00.880
It was to use the American industrial and economic power, this engine of industry in

25:00.880 --> 25:06.640
the United States, to defeat Soviet communism, which was its primary adversary.

25:06.640 --> 25:12.160
And lo and behold, within a decade of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, we get

25:12.160 --> 25:18.760
September 11th and the global war on terror, the American invasion of Afghanistan, right?

25:18.760 --> 25:24.720
And what an irony it will be if the graveyard of the Soviet Union, namely Afghanistan, also

25:24.720 --> 25:27.240
becomes the graveyard of the United States.

25:27.240 --> 25:34.120
And you know, within a few years after this fiasco in Afghanistan, the United States disintegrates

25:34.120 --> 25:38.560
the way that the Soviet Union disintegrated within a couple of years of the Soviet withdrawal

25:38.560 --> 25:40.200
from Afghanistan.

25:40.200 --> 25:44.780
Probably harder, considering the amount of weapons and the kind of division that exists

25:44.780 --> 25:46.560
in this country.

25:46.560 --> 25:54.440
Much harder, because you see, look, Russia was still an ethnically and culturally cohesive

25:54.440 --> 26:02.580
entity, even though they lost control over Kazakhstan and even Ukraine and so forth.

26:02.580 --> 26:05.760
You know, the Russians have an ethos and an ethnos.

26:05.760 --> 26:12.560
America is so internally divided that if the United States disintegrates, we're going to

26:12.560 --> 26:18.440
see a horrific civil war in North America.

26:18.440 --> 26:27.320
All kinds of conflict over resources, ethnic conflicts, you know, militarized class warfare

26:27.320 --> 26:28.320
and so forth.

26:28.320 --> 26:31.560
And so, yeah, I think the United States is going to fall harder than the Soviet Union.

26:31.560 --> 26:39.920
But you know, to go back to your point, or your, I don't know, speculation, hypothesis-

26:39.920 --> 26:40.920
My coping.

26:40.920 --> 26:43.760
Yeah, I didn't want to put it that way.

26:43.760 --> 26:45.920
But it's that I wish what you were saying is true.

26:45.920 --> 26:48.240
The thing is, I think it's by design.

26:48.240 --> 26:55.640
They're doing these absurdly, you know, self-destructive things because the people who are ultimately

26:55.640 --> 26:59.740
designing these policies actually want to see America fail.

26:59.740 --> 27:04.880
They have turned on the United States from inside and they're now transitioning to a

27:04.880 --> 27:10.880
model of world order where China is used as the dominant vehicle for achieving their objectives.

27:10.880 --> 27:14.520
Not the United States.

27:14.520 --> 27:19.320
So what you said about you can't even recognize New Yorkers, I think the same can be said

27:19.320 --> 27:24.120
about humanity in large, what's happening in Canada, in Australia, in specific.

27:24.120 --> 27:27.840
And you see it a lot of people, not only that they're not doing anything against it, they're

27:27.840 --> 27:33.840
rationalizing it just because they don't want to take any kind of an action.

27:33.840 --> 27:35.480
Where are we headed?

27:35.480 --> 27:40.420
Because what you're saying, and what I see, as I said, you know, there is a coping side

27:40.420 --> 27:46.120
of like, well, maybe this is the case, I don't know, but based on what I'm also observing

27:46.120 --> 27:55.180
with respect to humanity, there is not going to be any kind of a well-defined opposition

27:55.180 --> 28:02.700
against this incredibly focused and vicious kind of an attack on individualism.

28:02.700 --> 28:07.820
Would you say that this is ultimately an attack on individualism?

28:07.820 --> 28:17.480
Most definitely, and so that's why I focused my response on articulating a form of individualism

28:17.480 --> 28:23.500
that is not spiritually bankrupt and materialistic.

28:23.500 --> 28:30.680
One of the problems with the West, definitely from, you know, the 20th century onwards,

28:30.680 --> 28:40.180
is that the Western emphasis on the liberty of the individual and on, you know, the autonomy

28:40.180 --> 28:52.680
of the individual with respect to, you know, state power has been almost inextricably fused

28:52.680 --> 28:55.520
with a kind of soulless materialism, right?

28:55.520 --> 29:02.280
I mean, capitalism functioned as a kind of vehicle to free the individual to some extent,

29:02.280 --> 29:14.340
but capitalism also degraded, you know, the human experience by hollowing out all higher

29:14.340 --> 29:20.980
orienting values and by turning the individual into a consummate consumer, right?

29:20.980 --> 29:26.340
And so I think if we're going to extricate ourselves from this situation, we need to

29:26.340 --> 29:36.700
articulate a vision of individualism that is spiritually rooted and that has some higher

29:36.700 --> 29:43.340
aims or goals and that can reorient the developmental trajectory of our whole civilization, that

29:43.340 --> 29:49.620
can give man a sense of purpose and meaning again, while at the same time protecting the

29:49.620 --> 29:57.340
individual from collectivism and from, you know, totalitarian state power.

29:57.340 --> 30:02.540
So that's, you know, effectively what I'm trying to achieve with this Promethean vision

30:02.540 --> 30:04.100
that I've set forth in my writings.

30:04.100 --> 30:08.980
We absolutely need something like this because the only side, I see this wokeism and all

30:08.980 --> 30:12.900
that, whatever you want to call it, as a replacement for religion.

30:12.900 --> 30:18.880
This hollowing of the individual of any kind of anything other than the surface has been

30:18.880 --> 30:23.300
done from my perspective is specifically to get rid of the concept of religion and quote

30:23.300 --> 30:28.940
unquote God, just so state can become the higher power and the absolute authority.

30:28.940 --> 30:32.820
But the thing is the only replacement for it at this point that I see there is some

30:32.820 --> 30:39.540
kind of a backlash against the system is evangelical fundamentalist Christian rights that they're

30:39.540 --> 30:41.100
hell bent as we see right now.

30:41.100 --> 30:47.980
I mean, I'm not sure if this is a very good timing to push abortion into the narrative

30:47.980 --> 30:54.180
when you're a few days away from the recall election in California and, you know, maybe

30:54.180 --> 30:59.500
a year away from absolute tyranny to take over United States and all over the world

30:59.500 --> 31:02.680
if there is no any kind of organized backlash.

31:02.680 --> 31:10.800
And yet we are kind of stuck between this wokeism or Christian fundamentalism that now

31:10.800 --> 31:17.820
it energizes certain base, certain part of the base of the Republicans to take over the

31:17.820 --> 31:22.900
House, take over the Congress and take over the presidency they're saying in 2022 and

31:22.900 --> 31:23.980
2024.

31:23.980 --> 31:25.180
That's absolutely right.

31:25.180 --> 31:31.860
You know, if something isn't done about it, what we're going to see within a decade is

31:31.860 --> 31:37.420
the fracturing of the United States, some kind of a second civil war that results in

31:37.420 --> 31:42.500
a neo Confederacy, which is theocratic in nature, where we're going to see a biblical

31:42.500 --> 31:49.020
republic come from out of the South and, oh, what a wonderful alternative to wokeism, right?

31:49.020 --> 31:52.620
I mean, talk about being between a rock and a hard place.

31:52.620 --> 32:01.780
And so, you know, we need to really get on this and begin preparing rapidly from now

32:01.780 --> 32:08.860
to field a third way, another alternative, hopefully from out of the libertarian Western

32:08.860 --> 32:14.660
States of America, you know, the Wild West, not including the West Coast.

32:14.660 --> 32:19.660
But you know, there is a significant segment of the red states that are not evangelical

32:19.660 --> 32:24.540
conservatives and that are more libertarian in their orientation.

32:24.540 --> 32:29.780
And you know, while I certainly don't agree with Ayn Rand on many things, and, you know,

32:29.780 --> 32:36.580
I have big problems with her objectivism, after all, remember that the vision of Atlas

32:36.580 --> 32:42.620
was shrugged of a kind of, you know, utopia of liberty was based in the Western United

32:42.620 --> 32:48.900
States, you know, gulch, gulch, Atlantis, quote unquote, was actually, you know, it

32:48.900 --> 32:51.620
was in Westworld.

32:51.620 --> 32:57.860
And I think that's a place that, you know, we need to very seriously think about turning

32:57.860 --> 33:05.860
into some bastion of resistance against, you know, this, the machinations of these totalitarians

33:05.860 --> 33:11.860
and that as America begins to collapse, as the United States begins to disintegrate,

33:11.860 --> 33:18.340
we have to make sure that the center of gravity becomes that part of America and not, you

33:18.340 --> 33:22.220
know, Dixie, not the Bible Belt.

33:22.220 --> 33:25.780
That's a strategic objective that needs to be taken very seriously right now.

33:25.780 --> 33:29.820
It's interesting, though, because what you're saying is absolutely in favor of individualism,

33:29.820 --> 33:37.540
yet for any kind of a fundamental change, you require tribes to take over other tribes,

33:37.540 --> 33:42.220
you know, not necessarily violently, but, you know, it's only a better idea that will

33:42.220 --> 33:43.220
defeat an idea.

33:43.220 --> 33:49.420
It's a more capable tool that will defeat a tool and it's only a more capable God that

33:49.420 --> 33:51.020
will defeat a God.

33:51.020 --> 33:57.400
And so where are we with respect to, for lack of a better word, making Prometheism into

33:57.400 --> 34:05.380
a tribal kind of a gathering, tribal kind of a force, organized kind of a force?

34:05.380 --> 34:16.740
Let me just say something on a deeper level about that.

34:16.740 --> 34:19.740
Plato is a very complex thinker.

34:19.740 --> 34:21.380
Plato is an esoteric writer.

34:21.380 --> 34:25.540
There are all kinds of dimensions to Plato's thought.

34:25.540 --> 34:31.920
And I think that the Platonists really are doing a disservice to Plato.

34:31.920 --> 34:37.300
They misunderstood him fundamentally when they created this almost ideological system

34:37.300 --> 34:40.340
based on his thought.

34:40.340 --> 34:49.100
But Plato got something very right in Republic when he wrote that people need religion.

34:49.100 --> 34:57.180
People need some kind of a spiritual ideology to serve as the backbone of a viable constitutional

34:57.180 --> 34:58.180
order.

34:58.180 --> 35:03.200
And this is one of the things that, you know, Prometheus blessed them, the founding fathers

35:03.200 --> 35:05.940
of the United States did not really understand.

35:05.940 --> 35:12.940
They projected their own free spiritedness onto the majority of society.

35:12.940 --> 35:19.300
They misunderstood the mass of the American citizenry as potential Thomas Jefferson's

35:19.300 --> 35:26.060
and, you know, potential Tom Payne's, right, failing to recognize that the ethos that they

35:26.060 --> 35:36.260
had and the capacities that, you know, that were their own represent a tremendous deviation

35:36.260 --> 35:37.260
from the norm.

35:37.260 --> 35:44.820
I mean, these people were a spiritual elite who, you know, could have been a beacon of

35:44.820 --> 35:49.100
enlightenment and liberation for the entire planet and in fact, you know, in some ways

35:49.100 --> 35:51.700
were for a long time.

35:51.700 --> 35:59.620
But they overestimated the capacity of the average person to find his own way and, you

35:59.620 --> 36:04.020
know, define his own life under a constitutional order with something like, let's say, freedom

36:04.020 --> 36:10.580
of religion, where, you know, the state has no defined religious orientation.

36:10.580 --> 36:19.620
And you know, there was a letter actually that Jefferson wrote to Madison, I think,

36:19.620 --> 36:22.700
after he was president, after he was in office.

36:22.700 --> 36:28.400
And he basically wrote to Madison that in a couple of generations, there won't be any

36:28.400 --> 36:32.420
Christianity left in this country, that, you know, with the system that we provided, this

36:32.420 --> 36:37.380
kind of libertarian constitution and freedom of religion, we will, in effect, allow the

36:37.380 --> 36:43.940
free space for an educational system to arise that gives people the tools to liberate themselves

36:43.940 --> 36:45.900
and to elevate their own understanding.

36:45.900 --> 36:53.020
And then he adds after he writes this passage to Madison, and if it turns out that I'm wrong

36:53.020 --> 36:58.700
and that these Christians are still here in two or three generations, the experiment of

36:58.700 --> 37:01.540
the United States will have proven a failure.

37:01.540 --> 37:04.780
It will be reputation by experiment.

37:04.780 --> 37:09.680
This is an experiment, he said to Madison, and it will have been shown that we were wrong

37:09.680 --> 37:12.500
about human nature.

37:12.500 --> 37:20.380
So again, going back to Plato and Republic, in response to what you were saying, people

37:20.380 --> 37:28.260
need some higher orienting spiritual values or some deeply rooted basis for a constitutional

37:28.260 --> 37:29.260
order.

37:29.260 --> 37:34.340
A constitution isn't worth the paper it's written on if it's, you know, a set of soulless

37:34.340 --> 37:43.420
laws that, you know, are not somehow a reflection of the ethical fiber of the people themselves.

37:43.420 --> 37:50.300
And so, yes, I think Prometheism is or something, you know, like it is needed if we're going

37:50.300 --> 37:53.340
to successfully navigate this crisis.

37:53.340 --> 37:58.180
And in terms of, you know, the specific question of where we are at with that, I think that

37:58.180 --> 37:59.900
it's an idea.

37:59.900 --> 38:08.340
And the objective is to sell this idea to people with the resources to ensure that the

38:08.340 --> 38:12.320
collapse of the United States, which cannot be stopped at this point, that the collapse

38:12.320 --> 38:18.820
of the United States takes place in a fashion that yields a political order from out of

38:18.820 --> 38:23.580
the Western states, hopefully, out of the libertarian part of this country, yields a

38:23.580 --> 38:29.340
political order that can serve as at least a bastion of resistance and a staging ground

38:29.340 --> 38:33.700
for a liberation struggle on this planet.

38:33.700 --> 38:38.660
You mentioned Prometheism or something like it.

38:38.660 --> 38:44.100
A lot of people ask about your thoughts on Dogen.

38:44.100 --> 38:50.180
I don't want to talk about Dogen because he's not here to respond, but I'm curious to know

38:50.180 --> 38:55.180
what would you consider as some other things like Prometheism?

38:55.180 --> 38:59.780
What would you consider as alternatives to what exists right now that can be viable in

38:59.780 --> 39:03.380
the tomorrow of this piece of land?

39:03.380 --> 39:10.460
So my problem with Dogen's thought, and I briefly corresponded with him at one point,

39:10.460 --> 39:15.580
my problem with Dogen's thought is that basically it's traditionalism.

39:15.580 --> 39:24.020
You know, first of all, he doesn't really have an ontology or an epistemology.

39:24.020 --> 39:32.820
Dogen is an interpreter of Heidegger, and he interprets Heidegger in a very conservative

39:32.820 --> 39:43.380
way along the lines of this idea that our heritage determines our destiny and that we

39:43.380 --> 39:54.780
need to appropriate what's been vouchsafed to us by our ancestors and our political order

39:54.780 --> 40:00.540
has to be based on the native tradition of our people and that we can replace the current

40:00.540 --> 40:09.100
system with a multipolar world order organized around a number of different centers of gravity,

40:09.100 --> 40:16.620
each one representing an organically unified civilization structured around a certain pith,

40:16.620 --> 40:22.260
what he calls narod, an ethnos, that's the pith of a wider civilizational sphere.

40:22.260 --> 40:27.140
In some ways it's not all that different from Samuel Huntington's idea of the class of civilizations.

40:27.140 --> 40:33.180
And so it's like a Heideggerian version of Huntington's theory.

40:33.180 --> 40:38.900
So you know, Dogen doesn't have, well, no, I shouldn't say he doesn't have a conception

40:38.900 --> 40:51.340
of progress and the technological revolutionizing of human development, he does have a conception

40:51.340 --> 40:52.340
of that.

40:52.340 --> 40:53.340
He conceives of it as satanic.

40:53.340 --> 40:58.660
I mean, you know, he's also a representative of Russian orthodoxy and coming from out of

40:58.660 --> 41:03.620
a Russian orthodox worldview, he sees the forces that I would describe as Promethean

41:03.620 --> 41:12.860
as, you know, offering humanity an empowering evolution beyond the limits of what currently

41:12.860 --> 41:14.580
define the human condition.

41:14.580 --> 41:22.740
He sees all of that as basically a temptation from Satan and that, you know, the Promethean

41:22.740 --> 41:34.940
is effectively satanic and that modern technology is a demonic force that needs to be contained

41:34.940 --> 41:42.300
and that, you know, effectively we should go back to some kind of a, you know, agrarian

41:42.300 --> 41:45.100
traditional society.

41:45.100 --> 41:48.340
So I don't really see that as a solution.

41:48.340 --> 41:55.540
I, you know, I see that as an ideology that will be co-opted and used by the elites to

41:55.540 --> 42:01.620
de-industrialize large parts of the planet so that they can maintain a monopoly on singularity

42:01.620 --> 42:03.180
level technologies.

42:03.180 --> 42:06.540
Dogen is playing right into the hands of those people.

42:06.540 --> 42:13.540
And in fact, I don't want to go too far into conspiratorial territory, but I'll just put

42:13.540 --> 42:22.140
this out here that I know that there are some people very well-placed, let's say in the

42:22.140 --> 42:29.780
British intelligence apparatus that are using Dogen for exactly that purpose and he doesn't

42:29.780 --> 42:36.220
realize it, but his work is being promoted by people who certainly don't agree with him,

42:36.220 --> 42:43.860
but they find his ideology a convenient way to have a model ready for a de-industrialized

42:43.860 --> 42:50.180
neo-agrarian society where, you know, ignorance of the masses is enforced through traditionalism.

42:50.180 --> 42:55.060
Yeah, that was the part that was kind of a head scratcher for me when people were like

42:55.060 --> 42:57.620
what you were talking about in our first conversation.

42:57.620 --> 42:59.740
It was completely aligned with Dogen.

42:59.740 --> 43:04.540
I was like, my understanding of Dogen is that technology has no place in his philosophy

43:04.540 --> 43:05.540
whatsoever.

43:05.540 --> 43:06.540
It has a place.

43:06.540 --> 43:07.540
I'll go.

43:07.540 --> 43:08.540
It has a place.

43:08.540 --> 43:09.540
It's considered demonic.

43:09.540 --> 43:10.540
Right.

43:10.540 --> 43:11.540
Right.

43:11.540 --> 43:14.820
But not in the sense that it is part of human experience.

43:14.820 --> 43:21.060
I can't even divide human evolution and technological evolution from each other.

43:21.060 --> 43:26.420
What you described actually sounds very much like what Steve Bannon is doubling down now

43:26.420 --> 43:30.980
these days, that transhumanism has become an inseparable part of the dialogue and my

43:30.980 --> 43:35.980
understanding is that he knows that this is a losing war and he wants to make it into

43:35.980 --> 43:42.140
human versus, or as he's saying it, homo sapien versus post homo sapien.

43:42.140 --> 43:46.420
Now he doesn't phrase it that way versus that, but this is my understanding that they're

43:46.420 --> 43:48.140
pushing this.

43:48.140 --> 43:55.180
Anything that goes beyond the limits of biological humanity is basically, as you said, it's satanic,

43:55.180 --> 43:59.180
it's evil, it's dark, and we basically have to go beyond that.

43:59.180 --> 44:05.700
Well, isn't that convenient for the intelligences behind UFOs, right?

44:05.700 --> 44:12.980
We are surrounded by some advanced technological civilization that's fielding these exotic

44:12.980 --> 44:18.540
aircraft, and clearly it's a post-singularity civilization.

44:18.540 --> 44:24.540
Whatever technologies that we're looking at, their convergence into the technological singularity

44:24.540 --> 44:32.100
a generation from now, have already yielded a post-singularity civilization for the people

44:32.100 --> 44:34.380
who are piloting UFOs.

44:34.380 --> 44:43.300
The same entities that are regularly violating our most sensitive airspace already have the

44:43.300 --> 44:49.140
level of technology and scientific knowledge that people like Bannon and Dugin want to

44:49.140 --> 44:51.340
deny to humanity.

44:51.340 --> 44:57.100
My position is that we should achieve technological parity with these entities or come as close

44:57.100 --> 45:02.260
to it as possible and use that technology in a way that empowers the human individual

45:02.260 --> 45:09.180
and gives us some fighting chance against their machinations to basically turn us into

45:09.180 --> 45:11.740
a feudal serf population.

45:11.740 --> 45:16.260
Do you see anyone else talking about the same thing because the only other person I can

45:16.260 --> 45:22.940
think about except you that brings technology into the core of the issue, and he's not

45:22.940 --> 45:27.700
arguing for the sake of governance, he's a philosopher, Yuval Noah Harari.

45:27.700 --> 45:33.980
He sees the evolution very related with technology and humanity, and he goes beyond humanity

45:33.980 --> 45:42.620
and all that, but I see you as a unique, very, very unique example that is a treasure to

45:42.620 --> 45:47.940
some and a mortal enemy to some others as you just described because you hit right at

45:47.940 --> 45:55.720
the target and it's so organic to human existence that it's very, very difficult to deny the

45:55.720 --> 46:00.820
viability of it, and you really have to take refuge to some other kind of an ideology as

46:00.820 --> 46:04.740
you described that technology is evil inherently.

46:04.740 --> 46:09.660
Yes, unfortunately what you're saying is true.

46:09.660 --> 46:15.980
The problem with people like Yuval Harari is that they're still trying to accommodate themselves

46:15.980 --> 46:21.420
to the establishment to some extent and not engage with the data, say, of parapsychology

46:21.420 --> 46:28.580
or get into ufology and whatever because they think that it will discredit them with respect

46:28.580 --> 46:35.820
to the establishment, and at the very least one can say that's a miscalculation because

46:35.820 --> 46:45.660
I guarantee you the establishment view on things like ESP or UFOs is going to change

46:45.660 --> 46:54.780
dramatically within the next 15 to 20 years, and if we want to really develop an alternative

46:54.780 --> 47:00.980
to this global tyrannical system that's being put into place right now, we have to engage

47:00.980 --> 47:09.060
with the full range of data and with everything that's been marginalized by the establishment

47:09.060 --> 47:15.700
to date because the system that they want to put in place, the kind of technocratic

47:15.700 --> 47:23.700
global totalitarian state that they're engineering, it completely incorporates knowledge of parapsychology,

47:23.700 --> 47:29.980
and so to come up with a model that's a viable alternative to that, we need to do the same,

47:29.980 --> 47:33.100
and you can't worry about being marginalized on account of it.

47:33.100 --> 47:34.100
You have to think ahead.

47:34.100 --> 47:39.300
You have to think at least a few decades ahead, which is what I'm doing, so yeah, unfortunately

47:39.300 --> 47:40.300
you're right.

47:40.300 --> 47:44.980
I mean, there aren't too many people doing that, and I wish there were, and so when I

47:44.980 --> 47:49.860
said Prometheism or something like it, I mean like, look, if you have a problem with what

47:49.860 --> 47:51.580
I'm doing, show me a better way.

47:51.580 --> 47:53.220
I'll sign on.

47:53.220 --> 47:55.360
Show me a more viable alternative.

47:55.360 --> 48:01.340
If I see something better than what I've come up with, I'll go contribute to that project.

48:01.340 --> 48:02.980
Yeah.

48:02.980 --> 48:05.860
Let's go back to your book, Closer Encounters.

48:05.860 --> 48:11.820
You mentioned that you published a book as an alternative to the description of what's

48:11.820 --> 48:13.860
happening that's coming from the US government.

48:13.860 --> 48:14.940
What is your description?

48:14.940 --> 48:18.320
What is your perspective about what is happening?

48:18.320 --> 48:19.320
What are these machines?

48:19.320 --> 48:22.680
What are these entities behind these machines?

48:22.680 --> 48:32.900
So first of all, I engage with the full range of data, meaning that the book talks about

48:32.900 --> 48:33.900
abductions.

48:33.900 --> 48:40.580
I mean, the UAP report said nothing about close encounters, even of the second kind,

48:40.580 --> 48:44.060
let alone close encounters of the third and the fourth kind.

48:44.060 --> 48:47.320
The report was focused on what are called close encounters of the first kind, which

48:47.320 --> 48:51.940
are UFO sightings or the tracking of UFO by radar or something.

48:51.940 --> 48:57.580
Close encounters of the second kind are when a UFO lands and leaves traces, like landing

48:57.580 --> 49:04.460
gear marks or radioactive traces in the places where it landed, things like that.

49:04.460 --> 49:09.380
Close encounters of the third kind are when beings or entities are seen in association

49:09.380 --> 49:13.740
with UFOs, and then the fourth kind are abductions.

49:13.740 --> 49:18.100
So I deal with the full range of close encounters in this book, and that's one huge point of

49:18.100 --> 49:21.940
divergence from the UAP report.

49:21.940 --> 49:26.900
And I think that eventually we will hear from the government about abductions and implants

49:26.900 --> 49:32.180
and mutilations and the other subjects that I discussed, but we'll hear about it at a

49:32.180 --> 49:41.620
time and in a way that suits their purposes in terms of rolling out this global totalitarian

49:41.620 --> 49:45.240
system.

49:45.240 --> 49:50.560
And so one of the things that I argue in this book is that we're probably eventually going

49:50.560 --> 49:55.140
to be given a narrative that they're the good guys and they're the bad guys.

49:55.140 --> 50:01.100
And you've got these nefarious gray aliens here who are abducting your children in the

50:01.100 --> 50:06.880
middle of the night and they're implanting you and they're responsible for cattle mutilations.

50:06.880 --> 50:14.700
But then there are these beautiful, blonde, tall white ancestors who created us in distant

50:14.700 --> 50:19.460
antiquity and we are their offspring and they're our great ancestors, to put it in the language

50:19.460 --> 50:21.500
of Chinese Confucianism.

50:21.500 --> 50:30.580
And they are going to protect us from this diabolical enemy that's coming here and abducting

50:30.580 --> 50:32.260
people in the middle of the night.

50:32.260 --> 50:34.980
And the whole thing is a good cop, bad cop routine.

50:34.980 --> 50:36.020
It's a hydra.

50:36.020 --> 50:41.680
It's one entity with two or more heads and it's being used to create a false alternative

50:41.680 --> 50:50.900
in order to get us to submit to a control system that already, I argue, has shaped the

50:50.900 --> 50:54.100
religious beliefs of the majority of humanity.

50:54.100 --> 51:00.580
One of the lines of argument in Closer Encounters is that the quote unquote revealed religions

51:00.580 --> 51:07.660
are actually psychosocial control mechanisms put in place by the beings behind this phenomenon.

51:07.660 --> 51:18.620
And so I argue in this book that instead of falling prey to this good cop, bad cop routine,

51:18.620 --> 51:25.860
we ought to take a closer look at who exactly these beings are and what exactly the nature

51:25.860 --> 51:29.100
of the control system that we're ensconced in is.

51:29.100 --> 51:36.340
And my thesis is that what we're really dealing with here are not aliens coming from zeta

51:36.340 --> 51:43.380
reticuli or being caught in a war between two different alien races.

51:43.380 --> 51:55.300
What we're dealing with here is the deleterious effects of a group of human time travelers

51:55.300 --> 52:02.220
on the continuum of our history, that time travel was achieved at a certain point in

52:02.220 --> 52:06.740
human history, and that the people who achieved time travel technology, the people who harnessed

52:06.740 --> 52:13.980
zero point energy and constructed anti-gravity propulsion systems and vehicles that also

52:13.980 --> 52:19.380
are time machines, those people effectively set themselves up as gods over the rest of

52:19.380 --> 52:25.020
us by being able to deal with the variables of human history on a fifth dimensional level.

52:25.020 --> 52:35.380
In other words, to tinker with our 4D history from a higher dimensional vantage point.

52:35.380 --> 52:37.500
And that that's really the nature of the problem.

52:37.500 --> 52:45.220
And that's why we shouldn't expect any disclosure from any of our governments, any of the governments

52:45.220 --> 52:49.360
of the leading world powers, because this is not a question of the defense of humanity

52:49.360 --> 52:51.260
from some alien entity.

52:51.260 --> 52:57.460
It's a question of being inside of an invisible control system set up by humanity to oppress

52:57.460 --> 52:59.940
humanity.

52:59.940 --> 53:04.180
Would you say that they're going traveling back in time to change something in the future

53:04.180 --> 53:06.240
or they're just doing it to look?

53:06.240 --> 53:09.020
What is the purpose?

53:09.020 --> 53:12.780
If they've already achieved the God status and God capability?

53:12.780 --> 53:13.780
Yeah.

53:13.780 --> 53:19.260
What's the purpose of any political system for the people who lead it?

53:19.260 --> 53:21.020
Right?

53:21.020 --> 53:26.820
Once you are operating on a fifth dimensional level and you have, you know, zero point energy

53:26.820 --> 53:33.500
that allows you to traverse space time and set up societies that you control in different

53:33.500 --> 53:42.220
epochs, well, you know, why would you operate with any logic other than the logic of colonialism

53:42.220 --> 53:45.300
and mass oppression that's determined most of human history?

53:45.300 --> 53:46.300
Right?

53:46.300 --> 53:50.700
I mean, what we're dealing with are people with the same colonial mentality that the

53:50.700 --> 53:55.940
British Empire had, except they have time travel technology.

53:55.940 --> 54:02.180
And you know, they see the majority of the human population as an animal farm, as a herd

54:02.180 --> 54:05.140
that they want to maintain control over.

54:05.140 --> 54:10.020
And they have all these beautiful justifications for it, which I get into in my book, like,

54:10.020 --> 54:16.140
for example, that there's a cosmic order and they are higher evolved beings who are creating

54:16.140 --> 54:22.420
a microcosm of the cosmic order, which allows people with a low level of consciousness to

54:22.420 --> 54:27.460
cultivate themselves lifetime after lifetime through duty and service in their respective

54:27.460 --> 54:33.940
caste so that they can ultimately, you know, make their way up to the rung of the system

54:33.940 --> 54:37.980
that these putative gods see themselves as belonging on.

54:37.980 --> 54:38.980
Cosmic experts.

54:38.980 --> 54:39.980
Yeah, exactly.

54:39.980 --> 54:43.900
Cosmic experts, you know, the Brahmins of the old Hindu caste system.

54:43.900 --> 54:45.100
Right.

54:45.100 --> 54:50.780
And so, you know, and look, the British colonialists thought this way, too, about the Indian population

54:50.780 --> 54:53.300
and various Africans that they govern.

54:53.300 --> 54:58.100
So, you know, with reference to Charles Forth, among other people, I argue that effectively

54:58.100 --> 55:04.580
we're colonized, we're in a colonial system, and we're also in a system that resembles

55:04.580 --> 55:11.980
a farm where we're being tagged like animals and monitored and, again, they'll provide

55:11.980 --> 55:17.300
all kinds of sophisticated justifications for this, but really it's because they're

55:17.300 --> 55:21.860
sadists and they're drunk on their own power, like, you know, the governors of any colonial

55:21.860 --> 55:22.860
system.

55:22.860 --> 55:23.860
Yeah.

55:23.860 --> 55:24.860
Not bad.

55:24.860 --> 55:30.980
And there are people in our timeline right now that you would say are in contact with

55:30.980 --> 55:33.620
them and are aware of this dynamic?

55:33.620 --> 55:34.620
Oh, yeah.

55:34.620 --> 55:35.620
Oh, absolutely.

55:35.620 --> 55:41.940
I think that even the people involved in the UAP preliminary assessment at the highest

55:41.940 --> 55:45.100
level know exactly what's going on.

55:45.100 --> 55:51.260
When the Office of Naval Intelligence is audited by the Senate to hand over its entire dossier

55:51.260 --> 55:57.260
of close encounter reports, going back to the 1940s, and they come back and they talk

55:57.260 --> 56:04.580
about the Omaha and this one and that one from 2000 and, you know, the Nimitz and the

56:04.580 --> 56:09.780
Omaha from, like, 2004, 2007, that's all they have to give, well, listen, an executive

56:09.780 --> 56:14.660
decision was made at some level by somebody who knows what's going on, who's got all

56:14.660 --> 56:20.380
the data in front of them, who basically said, yeah, well, you know, to Congress, you know,

56:20.380 --> 56:24.300
we'll hand over what we want to hand over that allows us to spin this in a way that

56:24.300 --> 56:28.700
protects the plan, that protects the overall plan.

56:28.700 --> 56:33.820
And so, yes, I think that there are liaisons, you know, at a high level in the Navy and

56:33.820 --> 56:40.420
other branches of the military, there are liaisons who are meeting with members of this

56:40.420 --> 56:47.020
what I call the Nordic breakaway civilization, a time traveling breakaway civilization that's

56:47.020 --> 56:49.380
operating on a hyperdimensional level.

56:49.380 --> 56:54.980
Are these the same as lizard people?

56:54.980 --> 56:57.940
I get into that briefly in this book.

56:57.940 --> 57:06.340
I'm not convinced that these quote unquote reptilians are actually aliens.

57:06.340 --> 57:11.180
If you consider our own genetic engineering capabilities right now, let alone what they'll

57:11.180 --> 57:17.620
be, you know, on the other side of the technological singularity in a generation, even now in the

57:17.620 --> 57:24.620
top laboratories in the world, we could take dinosaur DNA, which we have, I mean, this

57:24.620 --> 57:27.740
is the Jurassic Park scenario, right?

57:27.740 --> 57:32.140
We could take dinosaur DNA and splice it with human DNA, particularly if you take the DNA

57:32.140 --> 57:39.820
of something like a Deinonychus, which was a like five foot tall bipedal dinosaur with

57:39.820 --> 57:45.180
opposable thumbs and binocular vision, and you splice it with human DNA, you can create

57:45.180 --> 57:48.260
a reptilian humanoid.

57:48.260 --> 57:53.740
And you know, I think it's possible that entities like that, like the so-called reptilians,

57:53.740 --> 57:58.220
are really products of a kind of Frankenstein's laboratory, not necessarily, you know, aliens

57:58.220 --> 58:01.940
coming here from somewhere else.

58:01.940 --> 58:04.740
Have you heard of stoned ape theory?

58:04.740 --> 58:05.740
Yes.

58:05.740 --> 58:11.020
Terence McKenna, so that's very interesting, because the argument is that our brain evolved

58:11.020 --> 58:13.380
much faster than the rest of our body.

58:13.380 --> 58:19.900
And some people are saying that actually the modern humans are the result of being genetically

58:19.900 --> 58:25.420
modified by extraterrestrial or maybe, as you were saying, humans who are time traveling

58:25.420 --> 58:27.980
from the future.

58:27.980 --> 58:34.100
But stoned ape theory is interesting to me because I've had numerous amount of psychedelic

58:34.100 --> 58:35.500
experiences.

58:35.500 --> 58:43.500
And on some of the substances like DMT, you encounter some of these beings that it's really

58:43.500 --> 58:47.980
pointless to even talk about it because it's beyond words what is happening, but it seems

58:47.980 --> 58:55.420
more real than this dimension or this reality, however you want to define it.

58:55.420 --> 59:05.240
Do you see any kind of an alignment between these interests and some of the substances

59:05.240 --> 59:09.540
that are available on this planet, like psychedelic substances?

59:09.540 --> 59:14.140
And perhaps that could be the reason that we have evolved the way we have evolved for

59:14.140 --> 59:16.820
the past tens of thousands of years.

59:16.820 --> 59:21.820
Well, it's a complex question, but yes, I do.

59:21.820 --> 59:25.940
In my book, In Closer Encounters, and this is a line of argument that I already began

59:25.940 --> 59:33.420
to unfold in Prometheism, I argue that we're living in a quantum computational system,

59:33.420 --> 59:37.180
that the cosmos is like a gigantic quantum computer.

59:37.180 --> 59:39.180
Simulation?

59:39.180 --> 59:44.180
The problem with the word simulation is that it implies that there's a reality and that

59:44.180 --> 59:52.300
this is a simulacrum of that reality, whereas what I actually think is going on is that

59:52.300 --> 59:56.060
it's just the nature of the cosmos to be a computational system.

59:56.060 --> 01:00:00.540
And there are many nested programs inside this system.

01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:05.580
So you could say it's like a simulation within a simulation within a simulation, but there's

01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:09.240
no original that this is a simulacrum of.

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:13.380
Information processing is just the nature of the computational cosmos.

01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:20.940
And substances like DMT, I think, are hacks to get to a higher reference level inside

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:27.820
the information processing system, that there's a wider cyberspace beyond the parameters of

01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:33.460
the reality that we're inside of, beyond the limits of the program that we are functioning

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:35.260
in the context of right now.

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:43.100
And the substances like DMT or other psychedelics basically allow you an access portal to another

01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:49.740
level of cyberspace, and that these beings like reptilians and mantids and so forth that

01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:56.460
are seen in that level on that dimension, if you want to put it in that language, are

01:00:56.460 --> 01:01:02.260
beings that know how to use this technology, namely the technology of psychedelics, in

01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:06.900
order to navigate the cyberspace more effectively than we can.

01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:14.380
And so I suspect that part of the metaphor of the forbidden fruit in Eden, which we find

01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:23.180
in the book of Genesis, is that at least some part of that was exposure to psychedelics,

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:30.220
that there was a kind of Promethean rebel faction within the breakaway civilization,

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:35.940
the Titans as it were, who split with the gods and became advocates of humanity, Titans

01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:43.980
like Prometheus, or in an Iranian context, Ahura Mazda, or Mithra or something.

01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:48.300
I was actually going to ask you if Ahura Mazda is the same as Prometheus.

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:50.300
Short answer, yes.

01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:58.580
And so I think that part of the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge was psychedelics

01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:01.220
and its transformative potential for human consciousness.

01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:06.940
Yeah, John Allegro, he has an entire thesis that Jesus himself was a mushroom, that people

01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:12.500
basically took and had these experiences, a manna from heaven and all those things.

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:17.060
I wish that Jesus were a mushroom.

01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:21.220
If you want to know what I think about Jesus, read, read closer encounters, but yeah, if

01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:23.380
only Jesus were a mushroom, that would be great.

01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:27.020
Yeah, I mean, we don't, can we even know who Jesus really was?

01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:33.500
Because the idea that is being presented, I don't buy it at all whatsoever because there

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:38.300
is a group of people who believe that Jesus actually didn't die and he went back to Kashmir

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:43.740
and there is a tomb and shrine for Jesus right there, which to me, it is more evidence than

01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:52.740
what they're saying that, oh, he went up and will come back with Imam Zaman kind of idea.

01:02:52.740 --> 01:03:00.300
To make a very long story short, the guy who died in Kashmir was Apollonius of Tiana.

01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:04.300
He was born at the same time as Jesus.

01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:08.280
He taught in Judea using the Aramaic language.

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:22.980
He was from Syria and he was a Pythagorean Mithraic initiate who basically preached his

01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:27.740
philosophical religion in the vernacular of every culture that he encountered.

01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:34.260
He attempted to translate his esoteric teaching in a language that a local culture would understand.

01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:38.580
He also was conversant in Aramaic, which was a kind of lingua franca of that region, and

01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:40.180
he taught in Judea.

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:45.340
When you read The Life of Apollonius of Tiana by Philostratus, who was a noted Roman author,

01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:53.180
we have almost no objective trace of this Jesus character in the literary high culture

01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:58.700
of the Roman Empire, in Roman histories, chronicles, anything, we can't find this Jesus character.

01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:05.500
But one of the most notable Roman authors wrote a biography of Apollonius of Tiana,

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:08.940
and there were statues of this guy in many Roman cities.

01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:15.780
According to this biography, the guy performed exactly the same miracles as Jesus when he

01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:27.820
was in Judea, exactly the same miracles, bringing Lazarus back from the dead, healing people

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:33.140
who were maimed in various ways, had various ailments.

01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:38.920
Point for point, the Roman authorities attempt to crucify Apollonius of Tiana.

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:45.980
He escapes crucifixion and travels through greater Iran into northern India, where he

01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:49.580
lives to a ripe old age and dies there.

01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:57.740
And interestingly, the name Jesus in Hebrew, Yeshua, just means savior.

01:04:57.740 --> 01:05:00.460
So it's a title, it's not a name, right?

01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:05.860
So Apollonius could easily have been called Yeshua when he was preaching to Essenes and

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:09.140
other people in Judea.

01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:14.260
So I think the guy who died in Kashmir was Apollonius of Tiana.

01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:18.580
But then there's a whole other thing going on in terms of this Jesus Christ.

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:23.100
And that's where we get into the close encounter phenomenon.

01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:30.740
There are many specific details in the Gospels that have to do with his baptism in the Jordan,

01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:36.100
the so-called transfiguration event, the resurrection, the ascension.

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:41.580
There are classic descriptions of close encounter phenomena of the type that you find all over

01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:50.100
the Old Testament, from the story of Moses and the Exodus to the tens of UFOs that Ezekiel

01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:56.460
sees, the coordination of the siege of the city of Jericho between Joshua and the commander

01:05:56.460 --> 01:06:01.140
of the Lord's army, who's one of these tall Nordics.

01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:14.260
The features of the Gospel account of the life of Jesus that basically have all the

01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:19.180
characteristics of a close encounter phenomena suggest that something else was also going

01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:24.460
on at that time and place besides the itinerant preaching of Apollonius of Tiana.

01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:31.980
Some kind of psyop was run in order to create this character, this image, this icon, Jesus

01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:41.340
Christ, son of Abraham, son of David, a Moshiach of the Jews, who would ultimately also become

01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:44.900
the second of the three great messengers of Islam.

01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:52.620
And so this is what I find profoundly troubling and which I discuss at length in my book.

01:06:52.620 --> 01:07:02.800
Probably there was Apollonius of Tiana as a genuine spiritual teacher as the basis for

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:04.940
some elements of the biography of Jesus.

01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:11.180
But then there was overlaid onto that some kind of a psyop and social engineering project

01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:22.860
which reshaped the raw material of Apollonius's mission in Judea into this monstrosity that

01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:28.060
is the institution of the Catholic Church or the Orthodox Church into this machinery

01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:35.100
that carried out the Holy Inquisition and other atrocities against the human individual

01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:36.620
throughout the course of centuries.

01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:38.580
To corrupt it, basically.

01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:47.700
Yeah, I mean look, if Apollonius was the basis for some of the more positive and enlightening

01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:55.180
aspects of the teachings of Jesus, it has been corrupted beyond any recognition and

01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:58.660
no attempt should be made to salvage it whatsoever.

01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:09.060
If Apollonius of Tiana could see what was done in order to produce Jesus Christ from

01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:18.100
out of whatever he was up to in Judea, I think that he himself would side with the antichrist,

01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:22.660
would basically become an advocate for Lucifer.

01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:30.060
So what is stopping a branch of Christians to pursue technological route and bring Jesus

01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:32.860
back in a form of hologram?

01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:38.260
There are Christians who are leveraging technology.

01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:40.540
There is a Mormon transhumanist organization.

01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:43.940
I had their founder and president on the podcast, this is years ago.

01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:50.900
And I also had a gentleman who is a reverend and a PhD who had argued, this is like five

01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:56.420
six years ago, that we have to use artificial intelligence in order to evangelize Christianity

01:08:56.420 --> 01:09:00.500
because we're basically being left behind.

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:09.420
Yeah, well you know, look, I mean I'm pausing because I'm so dismayed by these kinds of

01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:10.420
things.

01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:11.420
I mean I've seen them in my own life.

01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:18.260
I've been involved with people who on the face of it seemed very intelligent, well read,

01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:19.260
and so forth.

01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:25.180
And then in the end they just use their intellect to defend these retarded, regressive religious

01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:26.180
ideologies.

01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:30.620
This is exactly what you're talking about, like the idea that you would use advanced

01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:39.780
technology, singularity level technology, to manufacture the vindication of your prophetic

01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:40.780
literature.

01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:46.940
That you would sort of manufacture the second coming of Christ using advanced technology.

01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:51.700
This is what I'm really concerned about, is that, you know, back in the Cold War there

01:09:51.700 --> 01:10:00.140
was a plan, I think in the 1970s, when they first started developing holographic technology,

01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:07.220
the CIA had this plan to go off the coast of Cuba and paint a hologram of the Virgin

01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:14.940
Mary over the island of Cuba in order to incite a revolution against Fidel Castro.

01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:20.820
And I can well imagine that, especially if we have that kind of biblical republic that

01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:25.300
we were talking about earlier, arise from out of the American South, and some of these

01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:34.180
people still have access to high-tech companies and various resources to use singularity technologies

01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:40.340
that come online in the next couple decades, that a kind of second coming will be technologically

01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:50.020
manufactured and used in order to cement this global totalitarian system, which is one of

01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:57.780
the reasons why I am so vehemently opposed to the whole project of the revealed religions,

01:10:57.780 --> 01:11:05.420
and why I've been emphatic that Prometheus is Lucifer, that Lucifer is the Latin name

01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:12.060
of Prometheus, and that the reason I'm choosing Prometheus is because it's a symbol that doesn't

01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:13.700
depend on Christianity.

01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:20.340
The image of Satan or of Lucifer is sort of a reaction against Judeo-Christianity and

01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:23.520
it was formed within a Judeo-Christian context.

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:30.340
So in a way it's parasitic upon the Abrahamic revelation, whereas Prometheus is like the

01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:35.060
Satan before Satan, the original Satan, right?

01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:45.820
And so at the same time though, I'm perfectly, not only willing, but I'm perfectly clear

01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:51.540
in acknowledging that from a Judeo-Christian or an Islamic perspective, Prometheus is Satan

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:53.180
or Lucifer.

01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:57.460
And a lot of people come to me and they say like, this is, what are you doing?

01:11:57.460 --> 01:12:03.660
This is a disastrous strategy, you're alienating the majority of people, blah, blah, whatever.

01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:04.860
We're in serious danger.

01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:09.220
These people are thinking about manufacturing the second coming of Christ.

01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:10.220
They are.

01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:11.220
They are.

01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:13.380
They're thinking about manufacturing the second coming of Christ.

01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:17.820
Because I just said it hypothetically, that what is stopping a group of people to do that?

01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:27.020
They're planning to do this and we need a very hardcore resistance movement that is

01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:32.060
unequivocally opposed to this Christian and Islamic bullshit.

01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:35.580
There can't be any compromise.

01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:42.180
You need a backbone that can stand up against the second coming, a technologically engineered

01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:45.660
apocalypse.

01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:49.380
How far away are we, do you think, from that point?

01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:52.700
30 to 50 years.

01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:53.700
Wow.

01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:55.540
That's crazy.

01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:59.860
It's unbelievable how fast it's happening and it's also unbelievable how blind people

01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:04.780
are to realize that it is happening faster and faster because technology is advancing

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:06.780
exponentially.

01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:14.180
Our experience is linear, but our experience absolutely depend and is defined on a basis

01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:18.420
of technological advancement and progress, which is exponential.

01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:23.900
That's basically the whole purpose of humanity merging with technology at some point in order

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:30.140
to create whatever it is going beyond this biological limits that can be biological but

01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:33.740
also ideological with respect to Christianity and Islam and all these things that we talked

01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:34.740
about.

01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:35.740
That's right.

01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:43.060
Look, when you graph the approach to the technological singularity, there's this steep curve that

01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:51.100
takes place from the 20th century into the 21st century where progress is being made

01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:57.060
at such an exponential rate that over the course of every decade, there's more technological

01:13:57.060 --> 01:14:03.060
development than has taken place over preceding centuries until finally you get to the point

01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:06.860
where the steep curve becomes a spike.

01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:09.100
That spike is the singularity.

01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:16.020
What these people want is to deindustrialize large parts of the planet on the Dugan model,

01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:21.220
the traditionalist neo-agrarian Dugan model, deindustrialize large parts of the planet,

01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:26.140
retain a monopoly on these emerging singularity level technologies, secret them away from

01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:30.900
the majority of the population, and then use these technologies in order to manufacture

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:36.500
the apocalypse and project the second coming that is used to cement their millennium of

01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:39.100
totalitarian tyranny over the planet.

01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:40.100
Wow.

01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:42.940
Crazy times.

01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:45.940
Where do you see the role of Iran in this world?

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:52.340
For me, Iran could be the fulcrum of the whole damn thing.

01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:53.900
Why?

01:14:53.900 --> 01:15:03.580
Because first of all, no country is more Promethean in its foundation than Iran.

01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:07.900
This goes back to what you were asking earlier about Ahura Mazda and Prometheanism, right?

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:16.820
The Hakhaw Manasheed state ideology, the state ideology of the first empire known to human

01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:28.940
history, a cosmopolitan world order that encompassed almost the entire known world, where half

01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:33.620
of the population of earth at that time were citizens of the Persian Empire.

01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:37.060
The state ideology of that regime was Promethean.

01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:38.060
That's what that was.

01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:44.740
If you look at what Darius the Great was doing with the development of the banking system,

01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:50.020
with the standardizing of coinage, with the royal road system, this intercontinental highway

01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:55.900
that he was building, with his geoengineering projects, the canals, the bridges, et cetera,

01:15:55.900 --> 01:16:01.060
this guy was a titanic Promethean builder.

01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:07.300
This ideal of Ahura Mazda and Sephant Aminu, the progressive mentality, the forward-oriented

01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:13.700
mentality, and the fire of the forge that Iran was oriented around spiritually at that

01:16:13.700 --> 01:16:19.900
time, that is the beginning, at least in recorded history, of the Promethean trajectory of development

01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:26.740
that's taken up in the European enlightenment by people like the Marquis de Condorcet and

01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:29.420
Hegel and so forth.

01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:30.420
And so good.

01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:35.540
Correct me if I'm wrong, because I think my understanding is that Mithraism pretty much

01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:43.380
took over the world until Christianity merged with the Roman state in order to create political

01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:48.160
Christianity to stop the growth and spread of Mithraism.

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:49.160
Is that correct?

01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:52.840
Call me a conspiracy theorist, but it was done by design.

01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:57.020
We were this close to taking the Roman Empire.

01:16:57.020 --> 01:17:01.860
Iran and Rome would have merged, they would have become one entity stretching from Spain

01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:07.140
to the border of China under Mithraism.

01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:13.140
It would have been as Hacham and Ashit Empire 2.0, much more expansive.

01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:19.340
And instead of having this retarded ideology of Christianity be the spiritual backbone

01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:23.980
of the colonization of the Americas, the Americas would have been colonized from out of the

01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:29.540
old world by Mithras who are interested in liberation and progress, which literally would

01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:33.260
have been the return of Quetzalcoatl to the Mayan territories.

01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:39.820
These poor Mayans who had their own Promethean figure in distant antiquity, namely Quetzalcoatl,

01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:44.780
who fought a battle against Tezcatlpoca, their Zeus, the god of the smoking mirror.

01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:49.080
Tezcatlpoca is the guy who taught them how to cut human hearts out on tops of pyramids

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:50.860
and sacrifice people and all that.

01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:57.620
Quetzalcoatl is their Prometheus figure, and he was actually described as being a tall

01:17:57.620 --> 01:18:02.180
Nordic looking person together with his companions.

01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:07.560
So these poor Mayans were told by Quetzalcoatl that they would come back one day and save

01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:11.660
them from this tyrannical, archontic bastard Tezcatlpoca.

01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:17.300
And so when the Spaniards showed up, these Mayan priests misinterpreted them as the return

01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:25.100
of Quetzalcoatl, and instead these inquisitorial Christians plundered the Mayan world and burned

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:29.500
all their codices and so on and so forth.

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:34.860
Now if Mithraism had conquered the Roman Empire and the expansion further to the west from

01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:40.500
Spain into the Americas had taken place under the banner of Mithraism, of a Mithraic Rome

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:46.700
that had fused with Iran, imagine how different the contact with the Mayans would have been.

01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:48.500
And that future was stolen from us.

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:52.860
This is what I mean when I say the variables of our 4D history have been messed with on

01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:54.300
a fifth dimensional level.

01:18:54.300 --> 01:19:00.580
It's things like this, the creation of Christianity to change the timeline so that we wind up

01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:07.420
with this horrendous Catholic plundering of South America instead of a Mithraic enlightenment

01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:12.900
in South America, Mithraic reclamation of Mayan culture and so forth that we could have

01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:13.900
had.

01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:17.700
Yeah, interesting, you mentioned the Mayans.

01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:22.180
I've done a lot of DMT and many times, there are two different kinds, right?

01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:26.780
There's a natural one that comes, which by itself it must be an alien kind of an interference

01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:34.420
because there's one specie out of 7,000 plus amphibian specie, this toad, bufo, that generates

01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:39.700
the poison on its back and on its gland that you milk it basically and dry it and you smoke

01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:46.140
it and that's the natural DMT and it's only this toad that generate that kind of a substance.

01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:51.300
The other one is NNDMT, which is concentrated chemically created.

01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:56.300
You need to take three hits, visuals are way more profound than the bufo one.

01:19:56.300 --> 01:20:03.740
And I have come across the imagery of massive pyramid with Mayan symbology on them, massive

01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:09.540
blue and gold usually, pyramids with Mayan symbology around them coming across variety

01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:11.460
of these entities.

01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:19.340
I have never seen a cross or image of someone who like, I'm Jesus, I'm Christ and I'm not

01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:22.580
like, I don't have any kind of a bias against it.

01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:28.700
I think the humanity's mission from the beginning has been to identify this kind of a central

01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:36.180
point of alliance, central point of alignment that you said Mithraism, Prometheism and that

01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:42.020
has been stolen, this definition of the divine that we all basically can see ourself as a

01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:43.980
reflection of it.

01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:45.700
And so I just wanted to share that experience.

01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:51.300
I don't know if you had experiences with these kind of things, DMT especially, but I think

01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:53.540
that we got to get to some really interesting places.

01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:58.700
There is a place right now, DMTX, I think they're calling it, that they've developed

01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:03.660
this machine that will keep you going in that realm for hours instead of like the 20 or

01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:05.940
40 minutes and they want to map that realm.

01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:09.220
They believe that this is not a projection of mind.

01:21:09.220 --> 01:21:15.700
As you said, this is like a hacking or I think of it as the retuning of a receiver in order

01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:21.420
to be able to interact with this kind of, with these dimensioned wards, layers, whatever

01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:24.060
you want to call it.

01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:27.980
I completely support that type of work.

01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:31.980
I think one important point to make in response to what you said is that first of all, I'm

01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:36.540
very glad that you didn't see Jesus.

01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:39.740
I probably wouldn't make more money if I'd seen Jesus.

01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:40.740
Probably.

01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:47.140
And, you know, I've never said this on air before, but I've seen Jesus.

01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:51.620
And in retrospect, frankly, I wasn't that impressed.

01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:57.340
And you know, I think that at this point really has to be made that we are dealing with people

01:21:57.340 --> 01:22:04.700
who have what I call a psychotronic technology and they have a kind of technology that's

01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:07.200
on the other side of the spectral revolution.

01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:14.820
They have a technology that fully incorporates scientifically rigorous knowledge of ESP,

01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:16.620
psychokinesis and so forth.

01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:22.220
And so it's not difficult for these beings to project images into your mind.

01:22:22.220 --> 01:22:25.460
You know, it's razzle dazzle is what it is.

01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:31.820
And you should always consult your own conscience and examine your own ethos, not be awed by

01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:41.540
whatever psychic projections these beings want to use in order to capture you, basically.

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:51.420
And so, yeah, if you do see Jesus, please ask him what he thinks about the Holy Inquisition

01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:56.660
or about what was done to the Mayans, please ask him about Hypatia of Alexandria, who was

01:22:56.660 --> 01:23:03.380
skinned alive and burned at the stake under the orders of, you know, Bishop Kirill, who

01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:07.580
was subsequently turned into a saint and canonized by the church.

01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:11.820
I think maybe these are some good questions to run by him in case you see Jesus.

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:12.820
You're a witch burning.

01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:16.900
And by the way, have you ever heard of Apollonius of Tiana?

01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:21.980
Now it's interesting that you saw Jesus, was it on like, feel free not to answer, but I'm

01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:25.140
interested to see whether or not you were under influence of any kind of a substance

01:23:25.140 --> 01:23:29.260
or like meditation or something like that.

01:23:29.260 --> 01:23:33.060
The disturbing answer is no, I wasn't under the influence of any of those things, which

01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:37.100
makes it all the more impressive, disturbing and impressive.

01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:43.620
And I have to tell you that these things are these these things can't help but to be impressive

01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:46.260
in the moment in which you're in that experience.

01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:50.580
And this is actually one of my problems with a lot of these people who are acid heads and

01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:56.060
users of psychedelic substances, psychedelics, again, as I said, there are potentially very

01:23:56.060 --> 01:24:04.460
empowering technology, but not at the expense of your, you know, reasoning capacity and

01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:09.780
your examination of your own conscience and also your sense of social and political responsibility.

01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:11.100
Right.

01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:18.460
So you need to be able to contextualize any psychedelic or mind-expanding experience,

01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:22.420
even if it comes, let's say from meditation, you need to be able to contextualize it with

01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:24.500
all those other factors considered.

01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:29.260
So this is, for example, one of my problems actually, even with Gotama, is that when you

01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:40.140
look carefully at the things that Gotama was preaching, you know, Sakamuni, Buddha, Sakamuni

01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:47.380
had an experience of extremely refined, subtle states of consciousness that are, you know,

01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:52.820
even beyond what most people on psychedelics are capable of experiencing.

01:24:52.820 --> 01:25:00.700
But and and this is another very important point, Sakamuni explained to people that you

01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:05.260
could come away from these types of experiences with the delusion that there's a God because

01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:09.180
you lose your sense of your ego and you kind of feel like everything is sort of all one.

01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:10.180
Right.

01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:11.180
Yep.

01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:15.700
But he was also an ultra rational person, Gotama Buddha was, and he could explain how this

01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:20.380
is an experience of the interdependent origination of all things, and it doesn't mean that there's

01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:21.900
one God.

01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:24.700
That's a conceptualization of the experience in retrospect.

01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:29.020
You are objectifying that experience when you frame it as, oh, it's all one.

01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:30.020
It's Brahman.

01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:31.020
Absolutely.

01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:36.460
The Anatman teaching of Gotama Buddha is that it's not just no self in terms of your own

01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:42.340
personal ego, it's that there can be no entity with an inherent identity such as is imagined

01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:44.380
when people use the concept God.

01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:48.660
So that's an abstraction from out of that kind of psychedelic experience.

01:25:48.660 --> 01:25:55.900
But that having been said, one of my problems with Sakamuni Buddha is that he lost a sense

01:25:55.900 --> 01:26:00.540
of sociopolitical responsibility by having these experiences.

01:26:00.540 --> 01:26:06.260
His pacifism and rejection of the potential for social and political transformation is

01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:08.540
an abdication of responsibility.

01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:13.100
The man went AWOL, and that's my problem with him.

01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:16.020
And I think I make this argument at length in Iranian Leviathan.

01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:20.060
I think this is why Darius the Great exiled him to northern India.

01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:24.860
I don't think that the biographies we have of Gotama are correct.

01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:28.140
I think this was a man involved at a very high level in administration in the Persian

01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:29.140
Empire.

01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:34.560
He was a Scythian, and he was sent to be a sage in northern India after his death was

01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:40.900
faked by Darius, because Darius understood that putting this man in a position of sociopolitical

01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:44.500
responsibility would be disastrous to society.

01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:50.540
Would you say the sociopolitical responsibility is inherent within the human experience?

01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:53.660
Yeah, I agree with Aristotle on that.

01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:59.380
I disagree with Aristotle about almost everything, but I agree with Aristotle on that, that as

01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:05.540
Aristotle put it, man is a political animal, that one of the mistakes that these people

01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:12.980
who, you know, well, people who use a lot of psychedelics, who've had a lot of mind

01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:22.180
expanding experiences, they lose sight of the fact that if we're not vigilant about

01:27:22.180 --> 01:27:30.260
developing a constructive and empowering political system, our apathy is going to be used against

01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:38.620
us by people who will establish one or another form of tyranny, and will probably ban psychedelics

01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:41.140
as part of that tyrannical system, right?

01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:47.300
And I mean, look, just take the example of the Buddhists in the cradle of Buddhism, northern

01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:51.100
India and, you know, eastern Iran.

01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:55.100
Buddhism was wiped out in its cradle by Islam.

01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:59.820
I mean, the demolition of the Bamiyan Buddhas was the last act by the Taliban, but that's

01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:08.860
sort of like a, what do you want to call it, like, you know, epitaph of the centuries of

01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:14.100
genocidal warfare of Islam against pacifistic Buddhism.

01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:20.560
And it shows you the problem with, you know, misinterpreting the states of consciousness

01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:31.300
accessible through psychedelics as, you know, as, as, you know, some kind of a, some kind

01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:37.820
of an experience that shows you that politics is unimportant or that, you know, somehow

01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:43.540
like, you know, it's all about expanding our consciousness and having more experiences

01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:44.540
and all this.

01:28:44.540 --> 01:28:45.540
No, no, no, no, no.

01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:51.180
The tyrants are just waiting to put you inside a psychical control system where you're not

01:28:51.180 --> 01:28:56.900
even going to, children won't grow up in a society where they have access to such experiences.

01:28:56.900 --> 01:29:05.420
So you know, this is why I value Plato having taken politics as seriously as he did by comparison

01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:07.060
to someone like Gotama Buddha.

01:29:07.060 --> 01:29:11.980
I think they had very similar, similar levels of understanding in terms of ontology and

01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:17.500
epistemology, but you know, to me, Plato is the deeper and more serious thinker because

01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:20.220
he never lost sight of his socio-political responsibility.

01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:25.540
Yeah, it seems to me that it's more about recognition of human nature that, you know,

01:29:25.540 --> 01:29:30.260
without, without war, peace has no meaning and definition whatsoever.

01:29:30.260 --> 01:29:31.940
It's just both sides.

01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:35.280
I didn't want to use that term to both sides of the same coin because there is no coin.

01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:37.660
It is what it is.

01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:42.300
And what you said about people who, asset heads, as you mentioned, I totally agree with

01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:43.300
that.

01:29:43.300 --> 01:29:48.580
I don't hang out with anybody who is engaged in this under a lot of those people around,

01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:53.780
mainly because what you said about people who want to use technology to prove the gospel

01:29:53.780 --> 01:29:59.540
of Christ, for example, because they've already made a decision about what is enlightenment

01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:05.580
is, what is God is, what God is and all those things, and they're using these kind of substances

01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:08.620
basically to confirm a bias.

01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:11.940
So this is not looking for the truth or anything like that.

01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:17.500
And I believe that it will get you to a point from which you have to go by yourself without

01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:20.140
any kind of a tool, including psychedelics.

01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:21.340
You're absolutely spot on.

01:30:21.340 --> 01:30:27.420
A lot of people will become deluded and a lot of people use it as, you know, a justification

01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:29.480
for just doing nothing.

01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:34.500
Another thing is also, and I think this also affects you, that a lot of people like Buddha,

01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:39.620
for example, a lot of enlightened people, a lot of mystics, they write books and texts,

01:30:39.620 --> 01:30:45.620
which is the result of a journey that they've been on since they were born, all the experiences

01:30:45.620 --> 01:30:47.060
that they had.

01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:49.940
Reading those books don't make you enlightened.

01:30:49.940 --> 01:30:52.300
Reading those books don't make you knowledgeable.

01:30:52.300 --> 01:30:57.340
So this is, I'm sure, something that you also face with, that a lot of people maybe take

01:30:57.340 --> 01:31:01.220
different kind of outtakes.

01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:06.040
They have misconceptions about what you're saying, because what you've developed is based

01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:09.500
on a one, two, three, four, five, until ten, which is your book.

01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:12.640
And people are at one, they're looking at ten, they're like, oh, I got it.

01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:15.660
But they have their own biases, their own limitations and everything.

01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:16.660
Sure.

01:31:16.660 --> 01:31:17.980
I mean, that's true.

01:31:17.980 --> 01:31:22.260
But look, it's par for the course, especially if you want to get involved in sociopolitics

01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:28.620
and activism, you will be badly misinterpreted and misunderstood.

01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:31.140
You know, I mean, Nietzsche knew this about his own work.

01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:35.100
He, Nietzsche, you know, had a very small following when he was alive.

01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:41.100
I think he sold 300 copies of all of the books he ever wrote during his own lifetime.

01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:42.260
That's it.

01:31:42.260 --> 01:31:48.100
And he, but he wrote that someday he would be famous and he was kind of sickened by that

01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:54.960
prospect because he also believed that he would be badly misinterpreted, just absolutely

01:31:54.960 --> 01:32:00.980
perverted, grotesquely perverted by his own sister.

01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:04.980
He turned out to be that's right.

01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:09.500
Perverted by his own sister in more ways than one, but we won't get into that.

01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:12.500
But yeah, so look, it's par for the course.

01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:17.300
And if you want to get your hands dirty with political responsibility, you have to be ready

01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:22.420
to be misunderstood and to dumb things down and, you know, I mean,

01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:26.060
But I think it's also important with respect to spectral revolution that you've been talking

01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:29.940
about that I would ask you if you don't mind to describe it one more time for people who

01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:32.660
didn't hear it the last time you were on the podcast.

01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:36.700
Because it reminded me of what Gore Vidal said, that we don't even know what our cage

01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:39.860
looks like because we've never seen it from the outside.

01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:45.160
And so all these terms, all these definitions, good, bad, right, wrong, evil, good, they're

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:51.260
all being defined within this cage, within this frame that has been presented to us as

01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:58.420
a very limited pixel of possible reality within which we can't be controlled, we can't be

01:32:58.420 --> 01:33:02.600
held in line and all those things.

01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:09.020
So spectral revolution, you know, plays on the word specter, which is a polyvalent word.

01:33:09.020 --> 01:33:11.820
It has more than one meaning, the word specter.

01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:17.700
And I employ all of the meanings of the word specter and this concept of a spectral revolution.

01:33:17.700 --> 01:33:23.620
One sense of the word specter has to do with the spectrum, like the light spectrum, right,

01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:26.060
or electromagnetic spectrum or whatever.

01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:36.180
A spectrum is a phenomenon where various points that you might abstract from out of it are

01:33:36.180 --> 01:33:38.780
not really distinct from one another, right?

01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:50.040
So it's the idea that all of the categories or entities or qualities that we use to form

01:33:50.040 --> 01:34:01.900
binary oppositions like light and darkness, matter and energy, spirit and the spirit and

01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:08.940
the body or the soul and the body, and also ethical categories like good versus evil,

01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:14.580
that these are all terms abstracted from out of a spectrum that's continuous and that there

01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:19.500
aren't intrinsically sharp divisions between any of these.

01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:24.580
Then there's the sense of specter as what is to come, right?

01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:25.580
Specter is what is to come.

01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:29.660
And this is the sense in which Marx uses the word at the outset of the Communist Manifesto

01:34:29.660 --> 01:34:33.580
when he says there's a specter haunting Europe, the specter of communism.

01:34:33.580 --> 01:34:41.460
And so it evokes the idea of process that our cosmos does not have a static and fixed

01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:46.980
structure that we live in a world of becoming, that reality is processual.

01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:57.460
And this process, ontological process, has everything to do with why binary oppositions

01:34:57.460 --> 01:35:01.780
are our own abstractions and they're not intrinsic to reality, right?

01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:07.380
Because when everything is in a state of flux, you also recognize that light becomes darkness

01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:12.300
and good becomes evil and vice versa, and matter and spirit are two different phases

01:35:12.300 --> 01:35:15.300
of the same phenomenon.

01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:22.900
And so that second sense of the spectral as process, as becoming, as what is to come,

01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:29.760
as the future, it is very deeply connected to the first sense of specter as spectrum

01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:37.340
that defies all binary oppositions and deconstructs all apparent dichotomies.

01:35:37.340 --> 01:35:40.180
Because the core is quantum, it's not binary.

01:35:40.180 --> 01:35:41.180
Exactly.

01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:43.060
It's a probability function.

01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:44.060
It's a superposition.

01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:46.980
It's a superposition.

01:35:46.980 --> 01:35:52.340
And so then the third and final sense of the spectral is, of course, the most obvious one,

01:35:52.340 --> 01:35:53.340
the ghost.

01:35:53.340 --> 01:35:54.340
A specter is a ghost.

01:35:54.340 --> 01:35:59.900
And what I'm putting my finger on is that parapsychological phenomena, the ghostly,

01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:10.740
the paranormal, it is a key or a clue to the nature of reality as process and to the spectrum

01:36:10.740 --> 01:36:15.900
from out of which we are abstracting all these binary oppositions and dichotomies.

01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:22.180
And so the real potential of a scientific recognition of specters, of ghosts, of paranormal

01:36:22.180 --> 01:36:29.620
phenomena is to be able to deconstruct the putative reality of all these dichotomies,

01:36:29.620 --> 01:36:36.140
of all these abstract polarities and recognize that they're only terms that have a practical

01:36:36.140 --> 01:36:41.420
significance that really have a utilitarian purpose.

01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:46.100
And we should not idolize these objectifications that we've created ourselves.

01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:53.700
And we should understand that reality is process and that the driving force of everything is

01:36:53.700 --> 01:36:54.700
ultimately evolution.

01:36:54.700 --> 01:36:59.140
It's a creative evolutionary force that we need to align ourselves with.

01:36:59.140 --> 01:37:05.580
And that's the deepest philosophical significance of the spectral as the ghostly or the paranormal.

01:37:05.580 --> 01:37:19.900
Not to look at it as, I don't know, a bunch of marvels or wonders to gawk at or whatever.

01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:25.980
It's a fundamental transformation of our conception of the nature of reality that's really at

01:37:25.980 --> 01:37:30.660
stake here and taking a philosophical approach to the data of parapsychology.

01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:35.920
But then to get into the revolution aspect of spectral revolution, my suggestion throughout

01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:42.980
all of my works, beginning in Prometheus and Atlas, is that this recognition of the spectral

01:37:42.980 --> 01:37:50.340
on the deep philosophical level that I just summarized will require the total transformation

01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:53.000
of all of our social and political institutions.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:38:00.060
Because if you're going to admit that ESP is real or that psychokinesis is real, well,

01:38:00.060 --> 01:38:08.300
then you're faced with a problem of people telepathically spying on other people, people

01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:12.660
using psychokinesis in order to inflict harm on their neighbors.

01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:18.820
And there's no way that you can manage that through the current legal or criminal justice

01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:21.260
system, which is a punitive justice system.

01:38:21.260 --> 01:38:29.580
Its crime is committed and then there's some kind of retroactive justice.

01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:31.260
You can't have that.

01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:38.180
We tried that when witches were accused in Salem and in other places of hexing people.

01:38:38.180 --> 01:38:46.260
And judges back in the Puritan colonies ultimately had them burned at the stake.

01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:50.620
If we wind up with the mainstream scientific establishment not only recognizing an ability

01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:57.300
like psychokinesis, but developing training protocols for the cultivation of these abilities

01:38:57.300 --> 01:39:03.380
that would be akin to learning a martial art so that you have large swaths of the population

01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:09.700
cultivating their potential psychokinetic abilities, you also need a type of society

01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:23.500
that's going to be able to discourage the misuse of these abilities.

01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:32.580
Because there's really no way to handle that through the kind of punitive justice system

01:39:32.580 --> 01:39:33.940
that we have now.

01:39:33.940 --> 01:39:40.820
So what becomes more important than anything else is developing a society so deeply unified

01:39:40.820 --> 01:39:52.300
by an ethos that is based on each individual's recognition of his neighbor's right to live

01:39:52.300 --> 01:40:00.100
and to create and to have spiritual autonomy so that no particular member of this society

01:40:00.100 --> 01:40:07.540
would harbor the kind of ill will within his subconscious that would end up in a misuse

01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:13.060
of psychokinetic ability than after the fact has to be dealt with through a criminal justice

01:40:13.060 --> 01:40:14.060
system.

01:40:14.060 --> 01:40:19.580
You need to make it so that you have people so deeply unified on a psychical level that

01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:25.420
they would not even think to harm their neighbor by misusing psychokinesis.

01:40:25.420 --> 01:40:28.780
But of course then that presents you with the challenge of preserving the individual

01:40:28.780 --> 01:40:33.060
and making sure that the individual is not subsumed into some kind of a hive mind or

01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:36.540
collective consciousness.

01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:41.480
Whether or not this is something that can be achieved through genetic engineering.

01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:42.480
Very dangerous.

01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:54.900
I mean because you do not want to in any way eliminate the genetic correlates of human

01:40:54.900 --> 01:40:59.860
individuality from out of the genome or even compromise them.

01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:08.300
And so I think more what's needed is the cultivation of a spiritual ethos and the development of

01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:17.580
the core of a new society of spiritually resilient individuals who are free spirited enough to

01:41:17.580 --> 01:41:21.420
want to see their fellow man flourish.

01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:24.140
That's really what's needed.

01:41:24.140 --> 01:41:30.220
And yeah it's a tall order and you know I'm afraid to say that you know given the time

01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:35.580
constraints that we face there's just no way that you know you're going to be able to transform

01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:38.540
the majority of humanity in that fashion.

01:41:38.540 --> 01:41:48.540
So really it's a question of developing you know a model society, the nucleus of a new

01:41:48.540 --> 01:41:56.180
society and then defending it like a you know citadel against any and every potential enemy.

01:41:56.180 --> 01:41:58.660
Absolutely, absolutely.

01:41:58.660 --> 01:42:06.420
I'm not optimistic but this is a noble thought and concept to thrive for.

01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:07.420
Absolutely.

01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:08.420
And that's where you have to begin.

01:42:08.420 --> 01:42:11.660
People can look at me as a naive idealist, fine what are you doing?

01:42:11.660 --> 01:42:13.380
I mean come up with a better plan.

01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:17.140
It begins with an idea, it's an idea.

01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:20.860
You know if the right people are convinced by that idea something can actually happen.

01:42:20.860 --> 01:42:26.460
There are people with resources who understand the nature of the problem and if they haven't

01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:29.580
done anything better right now well don't blame them.

01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:31.300
They haven't been shown a better idea.

01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:36.060
You have to present them with an alternative vision that's viable and you know that they

01:42:36.060 --> 01:42:42.100
might prefer to the current modus operandi right, the de facto program.

01:42:42.100 --> 01:42:47.260
And then perhaps if you could convince enough of those people it will go from being an idea

01:42:47.260 --> 01:42:49.460
into a program.

01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:51.500
Absolutely.

01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:55.660
Well I never thought of you as a naive idealist or anything like that just to put it out there.

01:42:55.660 --> 01:43:03.380
I see you as a incredibly as I said unique and a valuable asset to humanity.

01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:09.300
And I have to say that I was completely disconnected with Iranian, everything coming from Iran

01:43:09.300 --> 01:43:10.300
because I grew up there.

01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:15.620
You know I lived there for 23 years, I went to school and I didn't want to have anything

01:43:15.620 --> 01:43:16.620
to do with it.

01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:22.420
It was until we spoke the first time that I went back and read and listened to some

01:43:22.420 --> 01:43:27.180
of your material on Iran and Persian Empire and the philosophy behind it.

01:43:27.180 --> 01:43:30.260
I actually feel good about being from that country.

01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:35.740
So I think this is a disservice that your books are not being taught at Iranian schools

01:43:35.740 --> 01:43:41.340
because it's not like well I guess it's against Islam but that's the order that everybody

01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:46.060
will be very lucky if it's replaced by something like Prometheism.

01:43:46.060 --> 01:43:54.660
Look I'll go I mean and I hate to end on this note but I have a lot of problems with the

01:43:54.660 --> 01:43:58.620
government of the Islamic Republic okay but I actually I cannot blame the Islamic Republic

01:43:58.620 --> 01:44:02.180
for the fact that my works are not circulating in Persian and Iran.

01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:13.140
I was involved with a group of people in the Iranian opposition who had enough resources

01:44:13.140 --> 01:44:17.020
to be able to ensure that all my writings were translated into Persian and we could

01:44:17.020 --> 01:44:22.580
have had them widely disseminated in Iran but let's just put it this way after working

01:44:22.580 --> 01:44:29.060
with them for a number of years I see why for 40 years the so-called opposition hasn't

01:44:29.060 --> 01:44:32.900
been able to overthrow this regime.

01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:38.380
They can't even get one thinker's writings competently translated and circulated in the

01:44:38.380 --> 01:44:43.740
country let alone rival you know the power of the Revolutionary Guard and its military

01:44:43.740 --> 01:44:45.660
industrial complex.

01:44:45.660 --> 01:44:53.460
So I think that there's potential for transformation from within Iran itself over the longer term

01:44:53.460 --> 01:45:05.620
and that Iran is very important in terms of the larger Islamic civilizational sphere and

01:45:05.620 --> 01:45:12.340
ensuring that you know the Middle East and Central Asia are not subsumed by this global

01:45:12.340 --> 01:45:16.940
totalitarian system that's being planned right now.

01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:25.220
That you know at a key moment Iran could act as a kind of Promethean force of resistance

01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:31.540
from within that whole civilizational sphere and internally transform itself while at the

01:45:31.540 --> 01:45:37.700
same time maintaining its force projection capability and acting as a kind of bastion

01:45:37.700 --> 01:45:45.900
of resistance from within the quote-unquote Islamic world and throwing a huge monkey wrench

01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:49.820
in you know the plan to basically subjugate the planet.

01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:54.060
I completely agree with you and this is an agreement that has been developed over the

01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:58.500
past maybe a year or over the past couple of months that I went from Iran should not

01:45:58.500 --> 01:46:04.780
have for example access to nuclear weapons to thinking to myself why wouldn't Iranian

01:46:04.780 --> 01:46:09.180
government want to have a nuclear weapon and a couple of them considering the world order

01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:11.220
and where they're placed at this point.

01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:12.220
I totally agree with you.

01:46:12.220 --> 01:46:18.140
You see like listen the people in Tehran watching this right now whatever you know people I'm

01:46:18.140 --> 01:46:22.220
doing your work for you there are a lot of people by the way they think like somehow

01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:25.740
I work for you know I'm somehow in cahoots with Iranian intelligence whatever the only

01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:30.020
involvement with the Iranian intelligence I've had is that they cyber hacked me they

01:46:30.020 --> 01:46:35.180
monitor all my stuff they've done it for years whatever but they should watch this right

01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:41.740
now and see that you know anyway whatever I hope that nationalists within the IRGC really

01:46:41.740 --> 01:46:47.300
take seriously the responsibility that they have to their own to their own heritage and

01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:51.460
to the rest of the world and understand what kind of a transition needs to take place there

01:46:51.460 --> 01:46:53.460
sooner rather than later.

01:46:53.460 --> 01:47:00.420
Excellent, you gave a message to Iran and Iranians and I want you to finish again thank

01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:04.620
you so much for this time it's such a pleasure having you on this podcast I hope that it

01:47:04.620 --> 01:47:08.500
can happen maybe once every year or something like that until we hit the single.

01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:10.540
It's always my pleasure anytime.

01:47:10.540 --> 01:47:11.540
Yeah likewise.

01:47:11.540 --> 01:47:18.180
Dr. Georgiani's book is Closer Encounters go and buy it and support this man all across

01:47:18.180 --> 01:47:20.280
social media and everywhere.

01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:26.140
You mentioned the message to Iran and Iranians let's end the program with a message to humanity

01:47:26.140 --> 01:47:31.580
and the world.

01:47:31.580 --> 01:47:40.540
Let me quote Nietzsche, man is a tightrope between ape and over man.

01:47:40.540 --> 01:47:49.260
A tightrope is not somewhere you want to stay okay it is not a stable place there is no

01:47:49.260 --> 01:47:57.660
human nature that defines the limits of what we can be in the way that various animals

01:47:57.660 --> 01:48:03.740
have a species being that they can't do anything about as you put it earlier in our conversation

01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:09.780
the quote unquote nature of man is inextricable from technology and technological development.

01:48:09.780 --> 01:48:17.020
Technology made us we were technological before we were human the use of technology by primates

01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:20.900
is what created the human being.

01:48:20.900 --> 01:48:26.940
And so my message to humanity is that it's out it's time for us to outgrow ourselves

01:48:26.940 --> 01:48:30.260
okay it is time to take an evolutionary leap.

01:48:30.260 --> 01:48:37.740
We are at a bottleneck in our development right now where either we have to go backwards

01:48:37.740 --> 01:48:49.860
into a neo feudal frankly retarded agrarian civilization where we have to face forcible

01:48:49.860 --> 01:48:56.060
deindustrialization because certain elites consider us incapable of bearing the responsibility

01:48:56.060 --> 01:49:01.580
of navigating the technological singularity or we have to be prepared to take this evolutionary

01:49:01.580 --> 01:49:13.260
leap into a form of individuality and a type of society that is superhuman or post human

01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:21.780
and everyone has to make a choice it's your choice you know which side of this battle

01:49:21.780 --> 01:49:28.060
you want to stand on whether you want to align yourself with the force of evolution and progress

01:49:28.060 --> 01:49:33.420
or whether you want to be a vehicle for the retardation of the planet and I put that choice

01:49:33.420 --> 01:49:40.140
before every human being to basically transcend and outgrow mere humanity or to be reduced

01:49:40.140 --> 01:49:46.700
to something like an ape right man is a tightrope between ape and overman you either have to

01:49:46.700 --> 01:50:05.340
walk backwards or you have to walk forward this is not a place we can stay indefinitely
