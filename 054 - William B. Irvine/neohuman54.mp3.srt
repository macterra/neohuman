1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
I've always thought that the fact that you have a culture where everybody agrees that

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,920
something is okay to do is by no means an indication that that's the moral, the right

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,920
thing to do.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,920
So, for instance, in the United States in 1860, slavery in the deep south, if you went

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,520
to Mississippi, everybody would have said, �Yeah, this is what God wants us to do.

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,280
This is the right thing to do.� In fact, some of the slaves would have even bought

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,280
into that.

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:33,320
That's the color of my skin means that this is my place to be the slave.

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,280
My reaction to that is they were just wrong.

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,280
They were mistaken.

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:53,280
Hello and welcome to the 54th episode of Neohuman Podcasts.

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:06,320
Today with me, I have the pleasure of having William B. Irvine.

13
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,560
Thank you so much for being with us, William.

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,080
Oh, it's a pleasure to be here and please call me Bill.

15
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,080
Bill.

16
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,080
Excellent.

17
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,840
How about we start from the beginning?

18
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,440
The work you've done and what are you mainly focused on now these days, Bill?

19
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,600
Okay, if you want the beginning, let's see.

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,520
I'm a philosophy professor at Wright State University.

21
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:40,640
In 2004, I guess when I turned 40 or 50, I had some kind of midlife crisis and somehow

22
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,800
decided I was going to become a Zen Buddhist, that that was the answer and thought before

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,040
doing that of course I needed to do research into Zen Buddhism.

24
00:01:52,040 --> 00:02:00,000
I also thought since I'm a philosophy professor that there might be an interesting way to

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,960
get a double out of this and by double what I mean is I would not only resolve my midlife

26
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,920
crisis but I could also get a publication out of it.

27
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,920
I set about writing a book on human desire and in the process of writing that book, I

28
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,800
got to look into Zen Buddhism.

29
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:29,720
Buddhism itself is very concerned with human desire and our attempts to curb our desire.

30
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:40,240
To be complete though, I had to consider other viewpoints on desire and so one of them I

31
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,080
had to do research on was Stoicism.

32
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,180
I didn't have a particular interest in Stoicism.

33
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:52,360
My only exposure to it in college, one of my majors was in philosophy but my only exposure

34
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,920
to the Stoics as a philosophy major was their logic.

35
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:05,640
It turns out they were some of the preeminent logicians of the ancient world and so I stumbled

36
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,640
across the fact that they also had their own take on human desire and the sources of human

37
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,840
dissatisfaction.

38
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:23,840
They give practical advice on dealing with desire and how to prevent unhappiness.

39
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,680
I toyed with their advice.

40
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,800
I took their advice to heart for a while and found much to my amazement that it was remarkably

41
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:39,320
effective and I also looked deeper into Zen Buddhism and found that in Zen Buddhism, now

42
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,400
there are people who will have different interpretations of this, but my takeaway is that what you

43
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,640
were waiting for is a moment of enlightenment.

44
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:55,040
You had to be a practicing Zen Buddhist for that moment to come and sometimes the moment

45
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,560
would come a day after you started practicing and sometimes you would wait 30 years for

46
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,480
your moment of enlightenment if it came even then.

47
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:11,640
So it's an interesting choice between trying something and maybe 30 years from now having

48
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:19,120
it work or doing Stoic techniques and having them work very quickly.

49
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:30,000
For me, it was an easy choice and also I seem to have an aptitude for the Stoic mindset.

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,040
That research came out in a book published in 2004 called On Desire, Why We Want What

51
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:42,160
We Want and I immediately decided I was going to follow that with a Stoic book and that

52
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,600
became my book, A Guide to the Good Life, The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy, which was published

53
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:59,760
I think in 2006 and I did not have any clue that the world would have an interest in reading

54
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,760
such a book.

55
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:07,920
I thought there might be a dozen people on the planet, but I thought it had to be written

56
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:17,760
and so I wrote it and it got off to a slow start but has done very well since then and

57
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:25,600
more than 10 years later continues to do very well just in terms of sales and the number

58
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,960
of people reached.

59
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:33,760
I consider myself a teacher so in that case, I take the book to be an example of teaching,

60
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:40,600
of reaching people and showing them the role philosophy can play in their life and as a

61
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:50,800
result of that, I've done other books subsequently on Stoicism including most recently my book

62
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,720
titled The Stoic Challenge.

63
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,640
And your new book is called The Stoic Challenge, A Philosopher's Guide to Becoming Tougher,

64
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,720
Calmer and More Resilient.

65
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,320
You mentioned the point and objective of enlightenment with respect to Zen Buddhism.

66
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,960
My understanding of Zen has always been that I think Alan Watts has a quote talking about

67
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,640
in Zen the point of peeling the potato is not to make a stew or something, the point

68
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,560
is just to peel the potato.

69
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:26,400
Now have you had any kind of a challenge about reaching certain kind of a goal and objective

70
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:33,500
rather than just focusing on being in the moment with both Zen and Stoicism because

71
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,300
just based on the title of your book, The Stoic Challenge is being introduced for the

72
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,840
purpose of becoming tougher, calmer and more resilient.

73
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,960
I guess one of the things that struck me when I did the research for the book on desire

74
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:58,360
was this notion of a philosophy of life or you could also call it a philosophy for living

75
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,960
and what such a philosophy does is it tells you what the primary goal, your ultimate goal

76
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:12,560
in living should be and Buddhism defines that goal as what they call tranquility and you

77
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,560
have to be careful because that's a word that could be misunderstood.

78
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,520
It doesn't mean a kind of a zoned out state like being on tranquilizers.

79
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:29,360
What it means is a life with as few negative emotions as possible, negative emotions, things

80
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:38,720
like envy, anger, anxiety and a philosophy of life will embrace positive emotions, emotions

81
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:47,160
like delight and even joy but it will give you a goal to aim at and I was first struck

82
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:53,440
that both the Stoics and the Buddhists agreed on the ultimate goal of life that they said

83
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,080
if you have sense what you're going to aim for in life is not fame and fortune, it's

84
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,440
not going to be the things and most people don't even have a coherent philosophy of

85
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,960
life, they just live day to day.

86
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,040
They know their goal of the day or their goal of the hour or their goal of the minute but

87
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:15,880
they don't have some bigger goal lurking behind those.

88
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:21,120
But the Stoics and the Buddhists both agreed with this goal of tranquility in the sense

89
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,580
I've described.

90
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,440
So what makes them different philosophies of life?

91
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:32,800
Well they have remarkably different strategies for attaining that goal.

92
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,760
So if you're a Zen Buddhist, you do lots of meditation for instance and you do try

93
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:45,360
to stay in the moment you do that kind of practice and that's all very useful.

94
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,160
In fact, I'm engaged in a course right now of meditation of that kind.

95
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:57,720
But with the Stoics, it's a completely different approach so it isn't a lot of meditation

96
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:05,460
involved rather it's ways to respond with the interesting situations that life presents

97
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:12,760
you with and it's also about staying grateful for the life you find yourself living.

98
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:18,680
And then if you'd like, we can discuss some of their strategies but that's one of the

99
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,520
principal things to keep in mind.

100
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,320
First, the notion of a philosophy of life provides you with a goal and provides you

101
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:32,480
with strategies and one of the primary Buddhist strategies is meditation, mindfulness and

102
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,960
that can play a role in Stoicism but it isn't the role that the Stoics played up.

103
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:43,600
Yeah, I definitely want to discuss the strategies but before that, let's define what Stoicism

104
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,520
is and where it's coming from and what is the definition of Stoicism today if you see

105
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,600
it as different than it used to be when it started thousands of years ago.

106
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:00,480
Okay, well Stoicism came into existence in about 300 BC.

107
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:08,720
A philosopher named Zeno of Citium decided he wanted to become a philosopher and so he

108
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,520
studied under various other philosophers.

109
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:18,200
He figured that was the best way to do it and in the process of doing so, he was exposed

110
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:27,960
to a variety of philosophies including philosophies of life like skepticism and cynicism and

111
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:35,560
after a while decided he wanted to form his own philosophy of life and what he was going

112
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:41,960
to do is blend together some of the other philosophies he had encountered.

113
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:50,760
So back then, we didn't have universities but you did have people who would become private

114
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,940
teachers for other people.

115
00:10:52,940 --> 00:11:00,760
They would set up their own school of philosophy and Zeno did that and he was a Greek and so

116
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:07,560
he set up what became the Greek school of Stoicism and again if you say what is Stoicism,

117
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,500
it's a philosophy but interestingly, he had other aspects to it.

118
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:21,820
So besides being interested in the role, the idea of living a good life, he was also very

119
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,160
much interested in logic.

120
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,920
He was interested in science and that wasn't unusual in the philosophers back then.

121
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:36,320
The people they would have as students would typically have multiple kinds of goals in

122
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:43,000
being students so a lot of them were young adults preparing for careers in law or careers

123
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,840
in politics and for those students, the logic would come in handy but he thought to have

124
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:56,260
a good life is more than just that you succeed at your job, you need a bigger game plan for

125
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:02,760
succeeding at life so he also provided his students with a philosophy for living.

126
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:10,160
Most of the writings of the Greek Stoics have been lost unfortunately but in the first century

127
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:17,960
AD, the doctrine was brought to Rome and the Romans took it up and made it their own.

128
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:26,600
My primary interest in Stoicism is in Roman Stoicism and it's connected with names that

129
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:33,880
a lot of people can have encountered so I mentioned Zeno of Sidium, most people have

130
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:41,840
never heard of him but if you say what about Marcus Aurelius, oh yeah, he was a Stoic and

131
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,840
he wrote this book called The Meditations, now again misleading title because for him

132
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:52,480
it didn't involve the kind of mindfulness meditation that as in Buddhist would do or

133
00:12:52,480 --> 00:13:00,560
people like Seneca who is quite an interesting person, he's currently my favorite of the

134
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:08,320
Stoic philosophers, he was not only a philosopher but he was a counselor to an emperor, he was

135
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:16,400
a playwright, he was a scientist and he was also the first century equivalent of a billionaire

136
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,280
so he was quite a guy.

137
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:25,480
Now Marcus Aurelius of course besides being a Stoic was himself an emperor so you have

138
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:33,480
these people who are mixing together Stoicism with other aspects of life and that's kind

139
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:40,680
of Stoicism that I think is most attractive to citizens of the 21st century, we have complicated

140
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:46,600
lives we're living and then the goal is okay and what is success?

141
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:53,400
One measure of success is having a good life and then what counts is having a good life

142
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:59,520
and the Roman Stoics following in the footsteps of the Greek Stoics gave an answer to that,

143
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:04,920
they told us well you need to pursue tranquility in the sense that I've described and they

144
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,120
said and here's how you do that.

145
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,160
You mentioned different types of Stoicism, Greek Stoicism and Roman Stoicism, what are

146
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,080
the difference between the two?

147
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:25,320
The Romans I think have a much bigger emphasis on these strategies, these psychological strategies

148
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:31,880
so I mentioned that the Stoics had diverse interests but they were the leading I think

149
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:37,800
they were the leading psychologists of their time and they had insights into the way the

150
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:45,640
human mind works, usually if you're an unhappy person you have only yourself to blame, you're

151
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:51,560
choosing the wrong goals and then when you reach those goals you're no better off than

152
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:59,840
you were before and so they had insight into human psychology and the Greeks seem to be

153
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:05,040
more interested in simply in virtue.

154
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,520
Roman Stoics were interested in that but they have this whole psychological angle that I

155
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:17,980
think is very attractive to many modern people who try it.

156
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:26,520
We are right now experiencing a great Stoic Renaissance, the number of people who would

157
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:32,880
call themselves practicing Stoics, there might have been a handful on the planet when I first

158
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:40,000
became a Stoic but now it's not unusual to encounter them, certainly not online.

159
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,280
If you're in the Silicon Valley, it turns out that's a hotbed of Stoicism within the

160
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,800
United States surprisingly enough.

161
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:57,760
When I wrote A Guide to the Good Life, this would be in 2006, I've done the numbers on

162
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,920
this and you can count the number on Amazon, the number of books that have Stoicism in

163
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:10,080
the title, there were only 40 and most of those were written by academics for fellow

164
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:15,040
academics so they weren't particularly accessible.

165
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,260
Recently I checked and books on Stoicism on Amazon are coming out at the rate of four

166
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:28,800
per week so there's this huge upsurge of interest in Stoicism as a philosophy and that's

167
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:37,080
kind of as it should be because it's very practical minded, gives you usable advice

168
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:45,760
and whereas if you're going to be a Zen Buddhist, you might take a decade before it really kicks

169
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,760
in.

170
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:54,780
My line on this is, Stoicism, hey, a three-day weekend, give it a try and you'll know by

171
00:16:54,780 --> 00:17:00,600
the end of that time whether it's working for you or not and judging on the kinds of

172
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,240
emails I get and just the continued sales of Guide to the Good Life, there are a lot

173
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,360
of people for whom it works.

174
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,520
Now between A Guide to the Good Life that you said came out in 2006 and your new book,

175
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:21,320
The Stoic Challenge that came out earlier this year, it's 13 years of gap and a lot

176
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:27,280
has changed considering social media and sociopolitical dynamic and how people are communicating with

177
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,740
each other.

178
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:34,800
How do you see the kind of change that has been developed during that 13 years and how

179
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:40,360
with Stoicism the relevancy of it has changed from your perspective from then 2006 to now

180
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,760
2019?

181
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:49,720
I guess in my own activities, I did several other books in that interval.

182
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:57,000
One of them was another Stoic book titled A Slap in the Face and what it is is it's

183
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,240
an analysis of insults because it turns out the Stoics were experts on insults, on how

184
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,480
to deal effectively with insults.

185
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:13,160
So that was a book in which I explored the psychology of insults, the politics of insults

186
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:21,960
and then you finally get to the Stoic advice on how to deal with them which is kind of

187
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,320
fun and kind of interesting and kind of useful.

188
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,540
The best way to deal with an insult is to ignore it.

189
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:34,440
You will deeply frustrate whoever it is who's trying to insult you and if you have some

190
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:40,720
wit and some presence of mind, often when you're insulted, it comes as a surprise you

191
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,800
didn't see it coming but if you have some wit, there are other techniques you can use.

192
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,800
One of them favored by the Stoics was you respond by insulting yourself even worse than

193
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:56,400
the insulter insulted you because that makes the insulter look like an idiot.

194
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
You know what you're saying?

195
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,060
Look, if you really knew me, that isn't the character flaw that you would pick.

196
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:07,280
If you really knew me, you'd realize there are at least five other character flaws that

197
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,860
I have that are much worse than that so you are not well suited to analyze me but thanks

198
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,700
for the effort anyway.

199
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:22,180
So you turn around the insult and you aim it right back at the source.

200
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:31,940
But the other question you asked was the growth of interest in Stoicism and I'm not

201
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:42,520
a sociologist so I can speculate but I don't know but one interesting phenomenon that lately

202
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:51,360
I've been looking into is at the same time as Stoicism was rising, there was the rising

203
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,120
of what you might call anti-Stoicism.

204
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:01,720
These aren't people who are opposed to Stoicism but they're people who take the opposite approach

205
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,960
to life.

206
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:11,480
Stoic will take whatever life offers him and try to make the best out of what life has

207
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,160
offered him.

208
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,320
So the old saying is the glass half full or half empty.

209
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:22,360
For the Stoic, the glass will be half full and that's only the beginning because he will

210
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,080
say and isn't it wonderful that I have water to drink at all and isn't it wonderful that

211
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:33,320
we have something like glass that lets you see the water inside and you can wash it and

212
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,880
it will last for a long time.

213
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,040
I must be one of the luckiest people around.

214
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,280
That's a Stoic approach.

215
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:49,040
Anti-Stoics, these are people who seem to look for things to be unhappy about.

216
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:54,700
They look for sources of things that they can complain about and complain about how

217
00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:01,320
unfair it is and then declare to the world how their soul has been crushed by this injustice

218
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,320
that's been done them.

219
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:11,280
That's another one of these sociological trends and I'm not quite sure why but trying

220
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:17,360
to go one level deeper in the psychology of this, I've often wondered whether there are

221
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:28,240
people who are wired with a Stoic inclination and for them, Stoicism comes easily.

222
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,960
I think I am that way.

223
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:35,560
I think I'm a person for whom I've always lived in a low-grade Stoic fashion and it

224
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:42,440
was only late in life when I discovered somebody's already thought this through carefully.

225
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:49,520
I get emails from people who will reveal to me, they'll say, �I've always been a Stoic.

226
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:55,760
I just didn't have a fancy name for what I was.� Well, more power to you and even

227
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:08,400
if you are a congenital Stoic, you still stand to benefit from the ancient Stoics, the Roman

228
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,520
Stoics in particular because they gave it a lot of thought and you will pick up new

229
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:20,520
Stoic techniques from them and so you will be able to use this native talent that you

230
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,720
possess, you'll be able to use it much more effectively in shaping your days and shaping

231
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,720
your life.

232
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:33,240
It seems to me that unlike religions, Stoicism suggests certain strategies as you said and

233
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:42,400
a framework and tools providing to a Stoic to reach his or her goal compared to religion

234
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:49,200
that sets very solid and uncompromisable kind of rules.

235
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,760
Would that be a fair assessment?

236
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:59,320
Yeah, the religion can actually coexist with Stoicism wonderfully and in particular Christianity

237
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:07,400
has long had a kind of a very hand-in-hand relationship with Stoicism.

238
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:13,440
Realized Stoicism is concerned with your life.

239
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,000
Christianity is concerned primarily, I would argue and some people would take sides with

240
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,160
this, but I would argue it's concerned with your afterlife.

241
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:27,440
It says, �Why should you live a certain way today?� Well, you want to go to heaven

242
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,880
or do you want to go to the other place?

243
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,800
Stoics, if you ask them, �Is there a heaven and a hell?� they would say, �Don't know,

244
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:40,520
but one thing that's for sure is you're alive now and probably you're going to be alive

245
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:46,160
for a while and you want that life to be the best possible.�

246
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:53,080
So Stoicism actually is quite compatible with Christianity and you can pick other religions

247
00:23:53,080 --> 00:24:00,640
and say the same thing because Stoicism is a psychological strategy by which you can

248
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:08,600
avoid experiencing negative emotions and if you're a Christian, you'd say, �Well, that's

249
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,600
great.

250
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,640
That's wonderful.� If you did that, you could have both a good life and if you're

251
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:19,680
a Christian, you could say a good afterlife too, but the Stoics didn't concern themselves

252
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,680
with that.

253
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,080
They didn't have rules, the Stoics didn't have rules.

254
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:30,200
Christianity has a variety of rules, didn't have rules, Stoics didn't have rules.

255
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,280
They had strategies and let me trot out one at this point.

256
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:39,400
It's called negative visualization and so what the Stoics suggest that you do as you

257
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:47,120
go about your daily business, every now and then you set aside a moment in which you think

258
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,880
about how your life could be worse.

259
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,040
Now you don't dwell on how your life could be worse.

260
00:24:54,040 --> 00:25:02,040
You allow yourself to have a flash, a flickering thought about how your life could be worse.

261
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,680
So right now I'm sitting in a chair in a warm room.

262
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:13,360
It's kind of cold and kind of windy outside where I am and you know what, I'm lucky I

263
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,360
get to be inside.

264
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,260
If I was outside, I'd be cold right now.

265
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,200
That's one example.

266
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,240
Other examples, think about the relationships that are important to you.

267
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,040
Well, those relationships can end.

268
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:32,600
In fact, those relationships will end because sometimes they terminate while the people

269
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:37,520
are still alive, but if nothing else, somebody's death, either yours or theirs, is going to

270
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,920
end the relationship.

271
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:49,160
Or a lot of people just going through that quick exercise will remind you of how important

272
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:55,280
that relationship is to you and it'll make you value that relationship.

273
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:01,680
Now some people when they hear this, they're going to think, oh well, if the goal is to

274
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:07,560
be a happy individual free of negative emotions, that seems like a crazy way to do it.

275
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:14,280
You're just going to be thinking about death and losing everything you've got and again,

276
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,920
that's not what I'm saying.

277
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,580
You don't dwell on it.

278
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:23,080
You allow yourself to have a flickering thought of it and then you get back to life and it

279
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,600
can have a profound impact on your psychological state.

280
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:33,920
I know that's the effect it has on me and I can find myself going from just a person

281
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:39,960
with a bit of attitude into somebody who is absolutely thankful that I'm living the life

282
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:46,200
I'm living, surrounded by the people who surround me with what health I've got and you can go

283
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:52,640
through the whole list because everything could be enormously worse and I'm a lucky

284
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,040
guy.

285
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,580
The reason I brought up religion because I hear some people make the argument that, well,

286
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:05,540
we are living in a very, as it's been portrayed by certain kind of perspectives, we're living

287
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:12,080
in a divided kind of a time at least within the Western civilization.

288
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,280
People believe completely different things and they're fighting all the time with each

289
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:21,920
other online and if you watch the news, you think that the world is coming to an end and

290
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,320
all of that and some people are making the argument that we had certain kind of identity

291
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:34,360
that was built on the basis of Judeo-Christian teachings and philosophy and rules and frameworks

292
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:41,240
and we went through a period of atheists being able to express themselves and convincing

293
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,360
basically people that maybe religion is not the best way to approach your life and that's

294
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,960
why we have lost the sense of unity.

295
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:57,160
We have lost the sense of moral ground upon which everything else is built upon.

296
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:04,120
I disagree with that but it seems to me that you don't necessarily have to believe in any

297
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:10,840
kind of monotheistic kind of religion to have ethics and unity with each other.

298
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:16,240
You can just believe, not believe, but you can practice stoicism for example and grow

299
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,680
yourself individually because the society is a reflection of individuals.

300
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,280
Yeah, I agree with that.

301
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,560
Here's one way to think it through.

302
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:36,000
So suppose you had two kids and you were watching them and you realized that the two kids had

303
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,320
a chance to steal and eat a doughnut.

304
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:45,860
I don't know, you fill in your example here and you watch and you see both of them.

305
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:50,240
This could be an experiment even and you could watch them.

306
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:57,600
One kid eats a doughnut, another kid sits there and you can see him wrestling with himself

307
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,480
and yet doesn't eat the doughnut, just sits there and leaves it be and then a third kid

308
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,400
also doesn't eat the doughnut.

309
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:10,200
The first kid obviously doesn't have a whole lot of self-control.

310
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,920
Second kid, you ask him, you didn't eat the doughnut, did you want it?

311
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,920
Oh yeah, yeah, I wanted it bad.

312
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,160
Why didn't you eat it then?

313
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,960
Oh, because I'd get punished.

314
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,960
Somebody would punish me and I don't want to get punished.

315
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,800
Okay, third kid who also didn't eat the doughnut, you ask him, did you want that doughnut?

316
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,160
Oh yeah, it looked delicious.

317
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,160
Why didn't you eat it?

318
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,480
Because it would have been wrong.

319
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,920
Are you worried somebody would have punished you?

320
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:39,680
And he says no, regardless of whether somebody punished me or not, it would have been wrong.

321
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,240
Now you can take people.

322
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:49,580
I've made the argument in various contexts that if you need religion to do the right

323
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:56,960
thing, if you need the threat of punishment from God, you're actually a less moral person

324
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,520
than if you do the right thing because it's the right thing to do.

325
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,780
That if you're doing the right thing not to avoid punishment or not to get praise but

326
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:12,080
because it's the right thing to do, that I think is a higher level of morality than

327
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,840
somebody who says, ìWell, I did the right thing because if God punishes me, I could

328
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:21,860
go to hell or I could have really bad luck.î Well, that's a very self-interested kind

329
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:30,160
of motive and I don't even know if that would count as a moral motive for action.

330
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,060
It's a self-interested motive for action.

331
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:39,000
One of the questions I keep asking, I bring philosophers and technologists and we talk

332
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:46,780
about many different areas but I'm very interested in how we are re-interpreting the definition

333
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:52,420
of humanity through our technological tools and technological advancement, artificial

334
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,640
intelligence being one of them.

335
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:00,340
One of the questions I ask them is that whether they think ethics and morality is subjective

336
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:06,440
or objective because some believe that to create a more aligned artificial intelligence

337
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:11,080
with the rest of our civilization, we need to interject some of our ethics and morality

338
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,440
within that system.

339
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:19,840
But the question is if we really have any clear idea or clear agreement on what is it

340
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,060
exactly that we are calling ethics and morality because it seems to be different from society

341
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:27,920
to society, from communities to communities.

342
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:34,240
Well, I think it's objective what morality is and then it turns into a very interesting

343
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:41,240
conversation of how you arrive at the ethical truths but I've always thought that the fact

344
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:47,320
that you have a culture where everybody agrees that something is okay to do is by no means

345
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:52,320
an indication that that's the moral, the right thing to do.

346
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,840
So for instance, in the United States in 1860, slavery in the deep south, if you went to

347
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:03,380
Mississippi, everybody would have said, �Yeah, this is what God wants us to do.

348
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:07,120
This is the right thing to do.� In fact, some of the slaves would have even bought

349
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,640
into that, �Well, it's the color of my skin, which means that this is my place to

350
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:17,080
be the slave.� My reaction to that is, �They were just wrong.

351
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:24,160
They were mistaken.� You know, there are different devices that you can use to try

352
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:28,360
to make that point or to try to convince somebody of that point.

353
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:35,180
One of them is suppose I told you, �So if you just think it's the culture, then suppose

354
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:43,000
I told you that I had some kind of special powers and I could beam you back in time to

355
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,640
Mississippi in 1860 and then which body you would inhabit back then was a matter of chance.�

356
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,880
So you know what, you could be a slave owner, you could be a slave.

357
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,080
Would you agree to that?

358
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:02,840
Would you say, �Yeah, sure, send me there.� Or would you come up with a different destination?

359
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:08,840
You know, a place where they didn't have slavery and where people were treated with respect

360
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,600
and their property was respected and most people would say, �Well, that's a no-brainer.

361
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,320
I'm not going to go to the first place.� You know, there's this notion that's come

362
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,880
up that you're not supposed to be judgmental of other people.

363
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:29,800
And I don't regard that � I mean you have a choice if you're a moral person.

364
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:35,160
You have a choice of first of all doing the right thing yourself and then second choice

365
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:39,640
of whether to comment on other people's morality.

366
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:44,040
I think there are probably times when to be a moral person you have to comment on other

367
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:53,240
people's morality because it's one way to prevent injustice to your fellow human beings.

368
00:33:53,240 --> 00:34:02,680
Yeah, but then online, you go online and people are highly judgmental, partly because the

369
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:07,200
internet lets them do it from behind a veil of anonymity.

370
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:14,160
So they can try to wreck somebody's day or life without danger of any kind of blowback

371
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,160
to themselves.

372
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:21,080
Aside from being judgmental, a lot of people seem to have capitalized on the sense of victimhood

373
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,500
as well.

374
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:28,120
Even if it's not about them necessarily, like you mentioned slavery.

375
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:33,200
Some people are saying that because our ancestors were slaves, we deserve to receive special

376
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:39,000
kind of rights or a special kind of treatment or any other kind of an individual because

377
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,980
all of us, we can't find something to feel victimized about and it seems to have been

378
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:51,600
made into an instrument of asking for special rights and gaining power and in many cases

379
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,600
political power.

380
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:58,920
Yeah, so you've raised two separate issues there.

381
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:06,740
One is the whole issue of being a victim and the Stoics would be very clear on this.

382
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:12,520
They would say, you get to choose whether you're a victim or not.

383
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,840
You don't get to choose whether you're a target of injustice or not.

384
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,840
So there can be times in life when somebody makes you the target of injustice and they're

385
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:28,680
very powerful individuals and what they want happens and you've been targeted and bad

386
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,240
things have been done to you.

387
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,360
But they said, that's something we don't have control over.

388
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:40,480
So that's how it worked for you but there's something you have considerable control over

389
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,400
and that is whether you choose to play the role of victim.

390
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,340
In playing the role of victim, you're going to sit around and say, it's so sad and my

391
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:54,400
life is so miserable and they've wrecked my life and there's nothing left to it.

392
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:00,880
If you look back at the ancient Stoics themselves, the Roman Stoics again are my favorite.

393
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,120
A lot of them managed to get themselves into trouble and so they would have been exiled.

394
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:10,840
In some cases, they would have been executed and what's interesting and it would have been

395
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:15,960
unjust but what's interesting is how well they took it.

396
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:26,000
So Musonius Rufus, who's one of the lesser Roman Stoics was exiled to one of the least

397
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,040
desirable places and so what did he do on the island?

398
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,640
He made the most of it.

399
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:40,080
He realized, oh, I've been targeted but I'm not going to play the role of victim.

400
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:45,840
I'm going to take what I've got where I am and I'm going to do with it what I can, which

401
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,880
is a wonderful kind of approach.

402
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:56,320
The second sort of thing you triggered my thinking about is there is a claim, for instance,

403
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:02,440
that some people say that there should be restitution for slavery.

404
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:09,960
So if they have ancestors who were slaves, then that entitled them to some kind of restitution

405
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:15,520
and that's an interesting claim and you can weigh the merits of that claim.

406
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,360
But one of the things to keep in mind is a lot of the people who have ancestors who were

407
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:24,120
slaves also have ancestors who were slave owners.

408
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:31,680
Thomas Jefferson had perhaps six children by a slave, Sally Hemings, a slave and then

409
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:39,320
you can follow their lines of descent down to people who currently exist and they can

410
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:46,040
all say, yeah, Sally Hemings is a slave, is an ancestor of mine and then there's this

411
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,600
interesting follow-up, well, so was Thomas Jefferson.

412
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,120
He was a slave owner.

413
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,600
He was also a president.

414
00:37:52,600 --> 00:38:00,840
So you're going to encounter these practical difficulties when it comes to reparations

415
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,840
for slavery.

416
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:06,760
Yeah, I guess a lot of people who are victimizing themselves, they don't even want to get to

417
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,360
those places.

418
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:14,040
Once you start talking about logical grounds, they just call you names and shut off the

419
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,040
conversation.

420
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,620
That's an unfortunate thing.

421
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:27,320
My next research project is on critical thinking and the kind of psychology that's in play.

422
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:34,200
When you try to have a conversation with somebody, it's just worse than ever of them thinking

423
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:39,040
they don't actually need to get reasons for what they believe that if you come up with

424
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,720
good reasons on your side, then the proper response is simply to shut you up or shout

425
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,680
you down.

426
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:51,120
That's unfortunate because we need all the thinking we can.

427
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:57,440
It could save us from some real bad situations in the world.

428
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,440
Absolutely.

429
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:03,000
Bill's new book is called The Stoic Challenge of Philosopher's Guide to Becoming Tougher,

430
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,760
Calmer, and More Resilient.

431
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,760
Let's discuss some of the strategies.

432
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,600
You mentioned two of them.

433
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,960
What are some of the strategies that you would like to share with people who are living in

434
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,680
this day and age and dealing with everything that we have to deal with in this modern life

435
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,840
that we are experiencing?

436
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:27,040
One of them I mentioned is this negative visualization.

437
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:32,040
You give yourself a moment to think about how things could be worse.

438
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,280
There are other variants on that.

439
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:40,880
One of the things you can realize if you're just having a nothing day, dragging through

440
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:47,820
a day, realize that whatever that you're doing, one thing to keep in mind is there will be

441
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:52,640
a last time to do, you will do whatever you're doing.

442
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:59,640
I use this sometimes when I'm out on a hot summer day, I have to go out and mow the lawn,

443
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:06,400
so I go out to mow the lawn and I can do that, thinking, �Man, this is no fun at all and

444
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,600
I wish I didn't have to do this.�

445
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:14,360
Then, another thought to entertain when you're doing it is the realization that there will

446
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:18,240
be a last time in your life that you mow the lawn.

447
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,480
This could be it.

448
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,060
If you live long enough, there will be a time in your life when you will look back and wish

449
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:32,400
you were young and healthy enough to be mowing a lawn.

450
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:38,040
You're living right now the dream world of the future you.

451
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:43,240
This assumes that you live long enough because with the passage of time, you're going to

452
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:48,280
lose abilities, things are going to happen.

453
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,160
Look back at your own youth.

454
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,800
Look at all the things you could do when you were 15 that you can't do now, the things

455
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,800
that just came so easily to you.

456
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,320
If you could be young again, wouldn't that be great?

457
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:04,720
Well, if you live long enough, you're going to have that same fantasy.

458
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:10,280
Only if you could be young again means whatever age you are now.

459
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:18,120
In my case, if I live to be 100, I'll think back to when I was 67.

460
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:22,520
I'll look back and say, �Boy, if I could only have those years over again.�

461
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,240
Well, I've got them.

462
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,720
I'm living them.

463
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:29,800
You know what, I should take full advantage of them.

464
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,640
I should soak up what they have to offer.

465
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:43,200
Another strategy to use if you're a Stoic is when things happen to you in life and you're

466
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:50,620
thinking, �How should I respond to the things that have happened?� The primary thing to

467
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:55,700
keep in mind is you ask yourself, �Well, what do I have control over?� The Stoics

468
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:02,160
were very clear on the importance of you in your life keeping distinguish the things you

469
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,960
have control over and the things you don't have control over.

470
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,800
Their advice is you need to be worrying about things you do have control over because you

471
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,360
have control over them.

472
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,240
The things you don't have control over, you're just wasting your time.

473
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,560
You're causing yourself needless grief, needless anxiety.

474
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,580
Let me give you a concrete example of this.

475
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:31,440
Suppose you're a competitive tennis player and you're coming up on some important match

476
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,080
and then the question is, �What should you do to prepare for it?� A lot of people will

477
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:41,520
just burn up a time and energy, psychic energy, thinking about the other side and thinking

478
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:47,120
about how worried they are about what the other side is going to do.

479
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:54,520
Stoic advice, if you had a tennis coach who is a Stoic, here's the advice you'd get.

480
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,280
Think about the things you can't control.

481
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,020
You can't control the game they're going to play.

482
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,880
You can't control how good they are.

483
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,040
You can't control how strong they are.

484
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,520
Don't think about it.

485
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,860
What can you control?

486
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:11,860
You can control how hard you practice.

487
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:16,580
You can control your strategy going into the game.

488
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:21,760
If you have any sense at all, you're going to take your time, your energy, focusing on

489
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:29,520
the things you can control and you're going to prepare, train to the best of your ability.

490
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:34,240
You're going to go in with the best game strategy you can think of.

491
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,240
You know what?

492
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,800
If that doesn't do it, what else could?

493
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,800
Nothing could.

494
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,840
If that doesn't win you the game, then winning the game just wasn't in the cards.

495
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:49,160
But it's certainly possible for you to lose a game that you could have won if you allow

496
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,880
yourself to be distracted by the things you have no control over.

497
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,520
It's a waste of time.

498
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,520
It's a waste of energy.

499
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,760
The Stoics would go on to point out that among the things you have control over, you have

500
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:10,640
very great or even absolute control over many of your own personality traits and character

501
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,840
traits.

502
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:19,920
For instance, to be honest, it's a choice you can make and you have it in your control,

503
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,300
so you should make it.

504
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:26,040
To be a caring individual is something you can decide to do.

505
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:32,520
May not come naturally to you, but you can decide to do it and it will affect your life,

506
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:38,120
the quality of your life, it will affect your relationships.

507
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:42,560
The idea though, do you have control over whether somebody becomes your friend or not?

508
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:48,240
Well, you can affect whether somebody becomes a friend or not, but you can't control it.

509
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:55,320
So the Stoics analysis, we waste so much of our time thinking or dwelling on things we

510
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:00,160
can't control and that's stupid because we can't control them.

511
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,920
So those are examples of their strategy.

512
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:10,280
When I look back at the advice they give and I realize it was only in the second half of

513
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:16,080
the 20th century that psychologists started thinking in these same terms and they developed

514
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,880
some of the same strategies as the Stoics had.

515
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,160
One of them is this whole notion of framing.

516
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:29,720
So in my book, The Stoic Challenge, it's about setbacks and when you experience a setback

517
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:35,160
in life, some people when they do, that's it, that's the end of the game.

518
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:41,960
They just say, oh no, I got setback so I give up, other people when setback have the ability

519
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:47,960
to bounce back and overcome the setbacks they're experiencing.

520
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:52,200
Part of the question is how you frame a setback.

521
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:58,440
If you're setback and you respond by playing the role of victim, well that's too bad.

522
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:03,360
It's going to be a personally tragic thing for you.

523
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:08,840
But when you're setback, if you instead say, well, it's not a setback, it's a challenge

524
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:13,920
and it's a challenge I'm going to do my best to rise to.

525
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:20,240
Interestingly if you look at some of the world's most successful people, you'll find that

526
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:28,180
one of the things that's true of them is the remarkable number of failures they experienced.

527
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:33,340
So success typically arises out of multiple failures and you can look at successful athletes

528
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:39,240
and you can look at successful business people, this seems to be true.

529
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:46,320
It's the case that they were setback on what made the difference, they bounced.

530
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:52,520
They found a workaround or they just said, hey, I failed, let's see, what can I learn

531
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:58,080
from that failure because I'm going to take a new approach, different approach where I

532
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:02,440
might make new mistakes but I'm not going to make that same mistake again and it turns

533
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:08,160
out that that approach to life can have a huge impact on where you end up in life.

534
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,240
I totally agree.

535
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:14,920
The example that you used for the athletes immediately reminded me of sumo and sumo wrestling.

536
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:21,040
I love sumo and I'm following it and beside watching it as a beautiful sport, a part of

537
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,640
it has always for me has always been how these guys are focused on their match that day and

538
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,200
when you're talking to them that, okay, what happened?

539
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,480
They're talking about, okay, this is what happened and are you thinking about championship

540
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,880
and every single time they're saying, I'm just focused on my next match and I'm focused

541
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:42,560
on doing the best sumo that I can do.

542
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:49,720
If your best isn't good enough, you do not need to regret, you do not need to apologize,

543
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:55,260
you did your best but of course most people fall short of doing their best because they

544
00:47:55,260 --> 00:48:01,120
fear failure and this notion of you don't go out of your way to fail but you realize

545
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:07,000
that if you're doing something hard, failure is a possibility.

546
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,880
It's maybe even a likelihood if you're doing something really hard.

547
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:18,280
The stoics went out of their way to do hard things just because they were hard and for

548
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:25,520
them, the idea that resilience didn't necessarily just come naturally, that it's something

549
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:34,120
you could develop and the way to develop it was to experience difficult, unpleasant, uncomfortable

550
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:41,100
situations and then deal with the setbacks those situations presented.

551
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:47,360
You walk away a stronger human being, somebody who is more self-confident, somebody who has

552
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:52,920
the ability to bounce instead of break when life presents them with a setback.

553
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:58,000
And I'm glad that we started this conversation with you saying that you became in stoic after

554
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,900
40, that you got into Zen and stoicism after 40 so it's not like people have to get into

555
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:08,360
it early in their life otherwise they're going to miss out on understanding a point of it

556
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,360
or anything like that.

557
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:13,040
At any point, I would imagine it doesn't matter what age you are, it's just a matter of perspective

558
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,040
and the will.

559
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,600
Is that right?

560
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,320
Yeah, I agree with that entirely.

561
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:25,080
I had assumed that stoicism worked best for older people but I have subsequently found

562
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:29,000
that that is very much a mistake.

563
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:35,400
I think you have to have experienced some challenges in life in order to really appreciate

564
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:45,240
what stoicism has to offer but there are people challenged at any ages you can name.

565
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:54,960
So sure, young and old alike and the strategies again work at all ages.

566
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,360
Adolescence has its own challenges and they're really tough challenges if you think back

567
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:04,600
of how hard it was to be a teenager.

568
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:10,960
So maybe they're a ripe audience for this but first of all they have to know that it

569
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:15,800
exists and they have to want to put it to work in their life.

570
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:20,880
What are some of the resources you would recommend for stoicism aside from your books?

571
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:29,960
Well, let's see, I've read a lot of psychology and so there are modern behavioral psychologists

572
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:35,720
who have looked into the same things that the stoics were talking about.

573
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:44,720
So somebody who was interested primarily in the psychology that lies behind the strategies

574
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:52,320
could look at, let's see, there's the book Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman.

575
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:59,360
It's a wonderful book and what he's done is very carefully through careful psychological

576
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,160
experimentation.

577
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:09,120
And his colleague whose name I'm blanking on right now did experiments in which they

578
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:16,080
tested out a number of psychological strategies in order to see the tricks the human mind

579
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:22,160
plays on us and more importantly the way to avoid those tricks.

580
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:26,200
So that's a useful thing to read.

581
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:35,600
The stoics themselves, even though they're philosophers, a lot of philosophy is simply

582
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:42,760
very difficult for a non-philosopher to read but that's not true of the stoics.

583
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:49,240
Marcus Aurelius, his Meditations, it's just his notebook, wasn't intended for publication,

584
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:58,120
just a notebook of observations about what he sees in life and how people can deal with

585
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,080
the challenges life presents.

586
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:10,600
So he has a lot of fans, he's got to be the best selling of the stoics.

587
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:22,320
And there's books, Massimo Pugliese's How to Be a Stoic is a wonderful book.

588
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:28,800
And in each of the books I've written I have a section of recommended reading so they can

589
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,520
check that as well.

590
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,520
Excellent.

591
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:35,720
Bill's new book is called The Stoic Challenge of Philosopher's Guide to Becoming Tougher,

592
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,720
Calmer and More Resilient.

593
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:42,260
You mentioned that next you're going to do a study about how to have conversations.

594
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:48,240
What is next for you aside from that and where can people follow your work?

595
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,240
Let's see.

596
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,800
I have a website, williambervin.com.

597
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,800
You're not on Twitter though, right?

598
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,800
I couldn't find your Twitter.

599
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,720
No, I'm a geezer.

600
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:04,080
And I'm realizing more than ever how my world has changed.

601
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:12,280
The first book that I published would have been in the early 2000s and it was a physical

602
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:19,080
paper manuscript and I would send it back and forth to the editor and it would be this

603
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:25,940
huge box, paper three inches thick and there would be this time lag between when you did

604
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,360
it and when you came back.

605
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:35,680
Now, it's all electronic and the book I'm currently working on, I'm making a goal that

606
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:42,360
there will be no paper that I consume in the production of the book so it's just all on

607
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,500
word processor.

608
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:49,960
But the other thing I'm realizing is it used to be that in order to successfully sell a

609
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:56,840
book, you needed to get book reviews and the book reviews to a considerable extent have

610
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,680
become secondary.

611
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:04,280
Now a sensible author, I'm not a sensible author but if I were, I'd be working social

612
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:09,080
media and I'd have a Facebook page and I would be Twittering and I would be doing all of

613
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:17,720
this other stuff and I should be but yeah, just I'm from the wrong generation apparently

614
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:24,520
which is no excuse at all.

615
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:29,940
And following me, I don't know, you know the notion of followers and again if I want

616
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:36,880
to sell books, I'm talking terrible but the notion of followers, well if you want to follow

617
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:42,080
me, read what I've written and that's the best of me that there is because I spend a

618
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:49,440
lot of time carefully choosing words and putting them down for the world to consume but yeah,

619
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:57,520
there are people who are followed on a daily basis by vast numbers of people which is one

620
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:04,800
of these social phenomena that I don't really understand but I'm an outlier so I'm to blame.

621
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:13,000
I realize that that's just an issue I have but certainly one of the things they can do

622
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:22,680
if they want to dip a toe into Stoicism, so on the Stoic website, WilliamBIrvin.com, I

623
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:28,040
have a whole bunch of Stoic essays that I've written and these are typically like 900 word

624
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:33,680
things that are available for free and you can take a look at them and it's practical

625
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:40,960
advice of Stoicism in your daily life, what sorts of things can it do for you and so that

626
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:46,240
would be an interesting way for them to dip in a toe and see if they like the water.

627
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,240
Excellent.

628
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,080
It certainly has been a pleasure talking to you.

629
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:54,880
Let me ask you the last question that I ask all my guests that if you come across an intelligent

630
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,960
alien from a different civilization, what would you say the greatest thing that we have

631
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:05,040
done as humanity and what would you say is our worst achievement?

632
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:13,760
Worst achievement is our inhumanity to each other which expresses itself routinely and

633
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:19,080
you take almost any culture, it's interesting to try to find exceptions to this and there

634
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:26,960
have been these periods of time when a bunch of people in the same place have gone crazy.

635
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,600
Let's say Germany, oh yeah, there was that World War I thing and that World War II thing.

636
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,600
What about France?

637
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:39,520
Oh yeah, the French Revolution where people were being beheaded.

638
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,520
What about Rwanda?

639
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:46,240
Oh yeah, there was that little incident when neighbors started killing neighbors and about

640
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:50,040
what a third of the population died.

641
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,840
What about the United States?

642
00:56:52,840 --> 00:57:02,560
Well, there was slavery, there was the witchcraft thing going on and you realize what a share

643
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:09,360
shallow fragile thing human culture is, how it's possible for people to live side by

644
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:18,000
side in harmony and then just start killing each other and then the sad thing is, could

645
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
it happen again?

646
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,760
Could it happen here in America where I am?

647
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:26,960
The answer is yes and if we think we're special and different, the answer is no because we

648
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,600
deep down are human beings.

649
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:33,360
That's the great human tragedy.

650
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:46,320
On the positive side, we've done some magnificent things as far as helping people is concerned.

651
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:54,880
We have raised the level of prosperity and this is a mixed blessing of course, but you

652
00:57:54,880 --> 00:58:00,160
think back, where were we 50,000 years ago or 70,000?

653
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:07,560
We were in the savannas of Africa and look at how far we've come and look at the artistic

654
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:11,400
productions and the scientific productions.

655
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:19,760
We are capable, we are gods, we are monsters and we just switch identities with the passage

656
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,920
of time apparently, so bittersweet.

657
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,840
It's a bittersweet state of affairs.
