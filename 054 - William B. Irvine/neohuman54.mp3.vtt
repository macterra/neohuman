00:00.000 --> 00:04.720
I've always thought that the fact that you have a culture where everybody agrees that

00:04.720 --> 00:10.920
something is okay to do is by no means an indication that that's the moral, the right

00:10.920 --> 00:11.920
thing to do.

00:11.920 --> 00:17.920
So, for instance, in the United States in 1860, slavery in the deep south, if you went

00:17.920 --> 00:23.520
to Mississippi, everybody would have said, ï¿½Yeah, this is what God wants us to do.

00:23.520 --> 00:27.280
This is the right thing to do.ï¿½ In fact, some of the slaves would have even bought

00:27.280 --> 00:28.280
into that.

00:28.280 --> 00:33.320
That's the color of my skin means that this is my place to be the slave.

00:33.320 --> 00:37.280
My reaction to that is they were just wrong.

00:37.280 --> 00:41.280
They were mistaken.

00:41.280 --> 00:53.280
Hello and welcome to the 54th episode of Neohuman Podcasts.

00:53.280 --> 01:06.320
Today with me, I have the pleasure of having William B. Irvine.

01:06.320 --> 01:08.560
Thank you so much for being with us, William.

01:08.560 --> 01:12.080
Oh, it's a pleasure to be here and please call me Bill.

01:12.080 --> 01:13.080
Bill.

01:13.080 --> 01:14.080
Excellent.

01:14.080 --> 01:15.840
How about we start from the beginning?

01:15.840 --> 01:21.440
The work you've done and what are you mainly focused on now these days, Bill?

01:21.440 --> 01:24.600
Okay, if you want the beginning, let's see.

01:24.600 --> 01:30.520
I'm a philosophy professor at Wright State University.

01:30.520 --> 01:40.640
In 2004, I guess when I turned 40 or 50, I had some kind of midlife crisis and somehow

01:40.640 --> 01:47.800
decided I was going to become a Zen Buddhist, that that was the answer and thought before

01:47.800 --> 01:52.040
doing that of course I needed to do research into Zen Buddhism.

01:52.040 --> 02:00.000
I also thought since I'm a philosophy professor that there might be an interesting way to

02:00.000 --> 02:07.960
get a double out of this and by double what I mean is I would not only resolve my midlife

02:07.960 --> 02:11.920
crisis but I could also get a publication out of it.

02:11.920 --> 02:17.920
I set about writing a book on human desire and in the process of writing that book, I

02:17.920 --> 02:21.800
got to look into Zen Buddhism.

02:21.800 --> 02:29.720
Buddhism itself is very concerned with human desire and our attempts to curb our desire.

02:29.720 --> 02:40.240
To be complete though, I had to consider other viewpoints on desire and so one of them I

02:40.240 --> 02:43.080
had to do research on was Stoicism.

02:43.080 --> 02:46.180
I didn't have a particular interest in Stoicism.

02:46.180 --> 02:52.360
My only exposure to it in college, one of my majors was in philosophy but my only exposure

02:52.360 --> 02:56.920
to the Stoics as a philosophy major was their logic.

02:56.920 --> 03:05.640
It turns out they were some of the preeminent logicians of the ancient world and so I stumbled

03:05.640 --> 03:11.640
across the fact that they also had their own take on human desire and the sources of human

03:11.640 --> 03:15.840
dissatisfaction.

03:15.840 --> 03:23.840
They give practical advice on dealing with desire and how to prevent unhappiness.

03:23.840 --> 03:25.680
I toyed with their advice.

03:25.680 --> 03:30.800
I took their advice to heart for a while and found much to my amazement that it was remarkably

03:30.800 --> 03:39.320
effective and I also looked deeper into Zen Buddhism and found that in Zen Buddhism, now

03:39.320 --> 03:44.400
there are people who will have different interpretations of this, but my takeaway is that what you

03:44.400 --> 03:48.640
were waiting for is a moment of enlightenment.

03:48.640 --> 03:55.040
You had to be a practicing Zen Buddhist for that moment to come and sometimes the moment

03:55.040 --> 04:01.560
would come a day after you started practicing and sometimes you would wait 30 years for

04:01.560 --> 04:05.480
your moment of enlightenment if it came even then.

04:05.480 --> 04:11.640
So it's an interesting choice between trying something and maybe 30 years from now having

04:11.640 --> 04:19.120
it work or doing Stoic techniques and having them work very quickly.

04:19.120 --> 04:30.000
For me, it was an easy choice and also I seem to have an aptitude for the Stoic mindset.

04:30.000 --> 04:36.040
That research came out in a book published in 2004 called On Desire, Why We Want What

04:36.040 --> 04:42.160
We Want and I immediately decided I was going to follow that with a Stoic book and that

04:42.160 --> 04:48.600
became my book, A Guide to the Good Life, The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy, which was published

04:48.600 --> 04:59.760
I think in 2006 and I did not have any clue that the world would have an interest in reading

04:59.760 --> 05:00.760
such a book.

05:00.760 --> 05:07.920
I thought there might be a dozen people on the planet, but I thought it had to be written

05:07.920 --> 05:17.760
and so I wrote it and it got off to a slow start but has done very well since then and

05:17.760 --> 05:25.600
more than 10 years later continues to do very well just in terms of sales and the number

05:25.600 --> 05:26.960
of people reached.

05:26.960 --> 05:33.760
I consider myself a teacher so in that case, I take the book to be an example of teaching,

05:33.760 --> 05:40.600
of reaching people and showing them the role philosophy can play in their life and as a

05:40.600 --> 05:50.800
result of that, I've done other books subsequently on Stoicism including most recently my book

05:50.800 --> 05:54.720
titled The Stoic Challenge.

05:54.720 --> 05:59.640
And your new book is called The Stoic Challenge, A Philosopher's Guide to Becoming Tougher,

05:59.640 --> 06:02.720
Calmer and More Resilient.

06:02.720 --> 06:07.320
You mentioned the point and objective of enlightenment with respect to Zen Buddhism.

06:07.320 --> 06:12.960
My understanding of Zen has always been that I think Alan Watts has a quote talking about

06:12.960 --> 06:17.640
in Zen the point of peeling the potato is not to make a stew or something, the point

06:17.640 --> 06:19.560
is just to peel the potato.

06:19.560 --> 06:26.400
Now have you had any kind of a challenge about reaching certain kind of a goal and objective

06:26.400 --> 06:33.500
rather than just focusing on being in the moment with both Zen and Stoicism because

06:33.500 --> 06:38.300
just based on the title of your book, The Stoic Challenge is being introduced for the

06:38.300 --> 06:43.840
purpose of becoming tougher, calmer and more resilient.

06:43.840 --> 06:49.960
I guess one of the things that struck me when I did the research for the book on desire

06:49.960 --> 06:58.360
was this notion of a philosophy of life or you could also call it a philosophy for living

06:58.360 --> 07:03.960
and what such a philosophy does is it tells you what the primary goal, your ultimate goal

07:03.960 --> 07:12.560
in living should be and Buddhism defines that goal as what they call tranquility and you

07:12.560 --> 07:16.560
have to be careful because that's a word that could be misunderstood.

07:16.560 --> 07:22.520
It doesn't mean a kind of a zoned out state like being on tranquilizers.

07:22.520 --> 07:29.360
What it means is a life with as few negative emotions as possible, negative emotions, things

07:29.360 --> 07:38.720
like envy, anger, anxiety and a philosophy of life will embrace positive emotions, emotions

07:38.720 --> 07:47.160
like delight and even joy but it will give you a goal to aim at and I was first struck

07:47.160 --> 07:53.440
that both the Stoics and the Buddhists agreed on the ultimate goal of life that they said

07:53.440 --> 07:58.080
if you have sense what you're going to aim for in life is not fame and fortune, it's

07:58.080 --> 08:02.440
not going to be the things and most people don't even have a coherent philosophy of

08:02.440 --> 08:04.960
life, they just live day to day.

08:04.960 --> 08:09.040
They know their goal of the day or their goal of the hour or their goal of the minute but

08:09.040 --> 08:15.880
they don't have some bigger goal lurking behind those.

08:15.880 --> 08:21.120
But the Stoics and the Buddhists both agreed with this goal of tranquility in the sense

08:21.120 --> 08:22.580
I've described.

08:22.580 --> 08:25.440
So what makes them different philosophies of life?

08:25.440 --> 08:32.800
Well they have remarkably different strategies for attaining that goal.

08:32.800 --> 08:38.760
So if you're a Zen Buddhist, you do lots of meditation for instance and you do try

08:38.760 --> 08:45.360
to stay in the moment you do that kind of practice and that's all very useful.

08:45.360 --> 08:51.160
In fact, I'm engaged in a course right now of meditation of that kind.

08:51.160 --> 08:57.720
But with the Stoics, it's a completely different approach so it isn't a lot of meditation

08:57.720 --> 09:05.460
involved rather it's ways to respond with the interesting situations that life presents

09:05.460 --> 09:12.760
you with and it's also about staying grateful for the life you find yourself living.

09:12.760 --> 09:18.680
And then if you'd like, we can discuss some of their strategies but that's one of the

09:18.680 --> 09:20.520
principal things to keep in mind.

09:20.520 --> 09:25.320
First, the notion of a philosophy of life provides you with a goal and provides you

09:25.320 --> 09:32.480
with strategies and one of the primary Buddhist strategies is meditation, mindfulness and

09:32.480 --> 09:37.960
that can play a role in Stoicism but it isn't the role that the Stoics played up.

09:37.960 --> 09:43.600
Yeah, I definitely want to discuss the strategies but before that, let's define what Stoicism

09:43.600 --> 09:49.520
is and where it's coming from and what is the definition of Stoicism today if you see

09:49.520 --> 09:53.600
it as different than it used to be when it started thousands of years ago.

09:53.600 --> 10:00.480
Okay, well Stoicism came into existence in about 300 BC.

10:00.480 --> 10:08.720
A philosopher named Zeno of Citium decided he wanted to become a philosopher and so he

10:08.720 --> 10:12.520
studied under various other philosophers.

10:12.520 --> 10:18.200
He figured that was the best way to do it and in the process of doing so, he was exposed

10:18.200 --> 10:27.960
to a variety of philosophies including philosophies of life like skepticism and cynicism and

10:27.960 --> 10:35.560
after a while decided he wanted to form his own philosophy of life and what he was going

10:35.560 --> 10:41.960
to do is blend together some of the other philosophies he had encountered.

10:41.960 --> 10:50.760
So back then, we didn't have universities but you did have people who would become private

10:50.760 --> 10:52.940
teachers for other people.

10:52.940 --> 11:00.760
They would set up their own school of philosophy and Zeno did that and he was a Greek and so

11:00.760 --> 11:07.560
he set up what became the Greek school of Stoicism and again if you say what is Stoicism,

11:07.560 --> 11:12.500
it's a philosophy but interestingly, he had other aspects to it.

11:12.500 --> 11:21.820
So besides being interested in the role, the idea of living a good life, he was also very

11:21.820 --> 11:24.160
much interested in logic.

11:24.160 --> 11:29.920
He was interested in science and that wasn't unusual in the philosophers back then.

11:29.920 --> 11:36.320
The people they would have as students would typically have multiple kinds of goals in

11:36.320 --> 11:43.000
being students so a lot of them were young adults preparing for careers in law or careers

11:43.000 --> 11:50.840
in politics and for those students, the logic would come in handy but he thought to have

11:50.840 --> 11:56.260
a good life is more than just that you succeed at your job, you need a bigger game plan for

11:56.260 --> 12:02.760
succeeding at life so he also provided his students with a philosophy for living.

12:02.760 --> 12:10.160
Most of the writings of the Greek Stoics have been lost unfortunately but in the first century

12:10.160 --> 12:17.960
AD, the doctrine was brought to Rome and the Romans took it up and made it their own.

12:17.960 --> 12:26.600
My primary interest in Stoicism is in Roman Stoicism and it's connected with names that

12:26.600 --> 12:33.880
a lot of people can have encountered so I mentioned Zeno of Sidium, most people have

12:33.880 --> 12:41.840
never heard of him but if you say what about Marcus Aurelius, oh yeah, he was a Stoic and

12:41.840 --> 12:46.840
he wrote this book called The Meditations, now again misleading title because for him

12:46.840 --> 12:52.480
it didn't involve the kind of mindfulness meditation that as in Buddhist would do or

12:52.480 --> 13:00.560
people like Seneca who is quite an interesting person, he's currently my favorite of the

13:00.560 --> 13:08.320
Stoic philosophers, he was not only a philosopher but he was a counselor to an emperor, he was

13:08.320 --> 13:16.400
a playwright, he was a scientist and he was also the first century equivalent of a billionaire

13:16.400 --> 13:19.280
so he was quite a guy.

13:19.280 --> 13:25.480
Now Marcus Aurelius of course besides being a Stoic was himself an emperor so you have

13:25.480 --> 13:33.480
these people who are mixing together Stoicism with other aspects of life and that's kind

13:33.480 --> 13:40.680
of Stoicism that I think is most attractive to citizens of the 21st century, we have complicated

13:40.680 --> 13:46.600
lives we're living and then the goal is okay and what is success?

13:46.600 --> 13:53.400
One measure of success is having a good life and then what counts is having a good life

13:53.400 --> 13:59.520
and the Roman Stoics following in the footsteps of the Greek Stoics gave an answer to that,

13:59.520 --> 14:04.920
they told us well you need to pursue tranquility in the sense that I've described and they

14:04.920 --> 14:09.120
said and here's how you do that.

14:09.120 --> 14:13.160
You mentioned different types of Stoicism, Greek Stoicism and Roman Stoicism, what are

14:13.160 --> 14:16.080
the difference between the two?

14:16.080 --> 14:25.320
The Romans I think have a much bigger emphasis on these strategies, these psychological strategies

14:25.320 --> 14:31.880
so I mentioned that the Stoics had diverse interests but they were the leading I think

14:31.880 --> 14:37.800
they were the leading psychologists of their time and they had insights into the way the

14:37.800 --> 14:45.640
human mind works, usually if you're an unhappy person you have only yourself to blame, you're

14:45.640 --> 14:51.560
choosing the wrong goals and then when you reach those goals you're no better off than

14:51.560 --> 14:59.840
you were before and so they had insight into human psychology and the Greeks seem to be

14:59.840 --> 15:05.040
more interested in simply in virtue.

15:05.040 --> 15:10.520
Roman Stoics were interested in that but they have this whole psychological angle that I

15:10.520 --> 15:17.980
think is very attractive to many modern people who try it.

15:17.980 --> 15:26.520
We are right now experiencing a great Stoic Renaissance, the number of people who would

15:26.520 --> 15:32.880
call themselves practicing Stoics, there might have been a handful on the planet when I first

15:32.880 --> 15:40.000
became a Stoic but now it's not unusual to encounter them, certainly not online.

15:40.000 --> 15:46.280
If you're in the Silicon Valley, it turns out that's a hotbed of Stoicism within the

15:46.280 --> 15:49.800
United States surprisingly enough.

15:49.800 --> 15:57.760
When I wrote A Guide to the Good Life, this would be in 2006, I've done the numbers on

15:57.760 --> 16:02.920
this and you can count the number on Amazon, the number of books that have Stoicism in

16:02.920 --> 16:10.080
the title, there were only 40 and most of those were written by academics for fellow

16:10.080 --> 16:15.040
academics so they weren't particularly accessible.

16:15.040 --> 16:20.260
Recently I checked and books on Stoicism on Amazon are coming out at the rate of four

16:20.260 --> 16:28.800
per week so there's this huge upsurge of interest in Stoicism as a philosophy and that's

16:28.800 --> 16:37.080
kind of as it should be because it's very practical minded, gives you usable advice

16:37.080 --> 16:45.760
and whereas if you're going to be a Zen Buddhist, you might take a decade before it really kicks

16:45.760 --> 16:46.760
in.

16:46.760 --> 16:54.780
My line on this is, Stoicism, hey, a three-day weekend, give it a try and you'll know by

16:54.780 --> 17:00.600
the end of that time whether it's working for you or not and judging on the kinds of

17:00.600 --> 17:06.240
emails I get and just the continued sales of Guide to the Good Life, there are a lot

17:06.240 --> 17:09.360
of people for whom it works.

17:09.360 --> 17:14.520
Now between A Guide to the Good Life that you said came out in 2006 and your new book,

17:14.520 --> 17:21.320
The Stoic Challenge that came out earlier this year, it's 13 years of gap and a lot

17:21.320 --> 17:27.280
has changed considering social media and sociopolitical dynamic and how people are communicating with

17:27.280 --> 17:28.740
each other.

17:28.740 --> 17:34.800
How do you see the kind of change that has been developed during that 13 years and how

17:34.800 --> 17:40.360
with Stoicism the relevancy of it has changed from your perspective from then 2006 to now

17:40.360 --> 17:42.760
2019?

17:42.760 --> 17:49.720
I guess in my own activities, I did several other books in that interval.

17:49.720 --> 17:57.000
One of them was another Stoic book titled A Slap in the Face and what it is is it's

17:57.000 --> 18:03.240
an analysis of insults because it turns out the Stoics were experts on insults, on how

18:03.240 --> 18:06.480
to deal effectively with insults.

18:06.480 --> 18:13.160
So that was a book in which I explored the psychology of insults, the politics of insults

18:13.160 --> 18:21.960
and then you finally get to the Stoic advice on how to deal with them which is kind of

18:21.960 --> 18:24.320
fun and kind of interesting and kind of useful.

18:24.320 --> 18:28.540
The best way to deal with an insult is to ignore it.

18:28.540 --> 18:34.440
You will deeply frustrate whoever it is who's trying to insult you and if you have some

18:34.440 --> 18:40.720
wit and some presence of mind, often when you're insulted, it comes as a surprise you

18:40.720 --> 18:45.800
didn't see it coming but if you have some wit, there are other techniques you can use.

18:45.800 --> 18:50.800
One of them favored by the Stoics was you respond by insulting yourself even worse than

18:50.800 --> 18:56.400
the insulter insulted you because that makes the insulter look like an idiot.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.400
You know what you're saying?

18:57.400 --> 19:02.060
Look, if you really knew me, that isn't the character flaw that you would pick.

19:02.060 --> 19:07.280
If you really knew me, you'd realize there are at least five other character flaws that

19:07.280 --> 19:13.860
I have that are much worse than that so you are not well suited to analyze me but thanks

19:13.860 --> 19:16.700
for the effort anyway.

19:16.700 --> 19:22.180
So you turn around the insult and you aim it right back at the source.

19:22.180 --> 19:31.940
But the other question you asked was the growth of interest in Stoicism and I'm not

19:31.940 --> 19:42.520
a sociologist so I can speculate but I don't know but one interesting phenomenon that lately

19:42.520 --> 19:51.360
I've been looking into is at the same time as Stoicism was rising, there was the rising

19:51.360 --> 19:56.120
of what you might call anti-Stoicism.

19:56.120 --> 20:01.720
These aren't people who are opposed to Stoicism but they're people who take the opposite approach

20:01.720 --> 20:03.960
to life.

20:03.960 --> 20:11.480
Stoic will take whatever life offers him and try to make the best out of what life has

20:11.480 --> 20:13.160
offered him.

20:13.160 --> 20:17.320
So the old saying is the glass half full or half empty.

20:17.320 --> 20:22.360
For the Stoic, the glass will be half full and that's only the beginning because he will

20:22.360 --> 20:27.080
say and isn't it wonderful that I have water to drink at all and isn't it wonderful that

20:27.080 --> 20:33.320
we have something like glass that lets you see the water inside and you can wash it and

20:33.320 --> 20:35.880
it will last for a long time.

20:35.880 --> 20:39.040
I must be one of the luckiest people around.

20:39.040 --> 20:41.280
That's a Stoic approach.

20:41.280 --> 20:49.040
Anti-Stoics, these are people who seem to look for things to be unhappy about.

20:49.040 --> 20:54.700
They look for sources of things that they can complain about and complain about how

20:54.700 --> 21:01.320
unfair it is and then declare to the world how their soul has been crushed by this injustice

21:01.320 --> 21:04.320
that's been done them.

21:04.320 --> 21:11.280
That's another one of these sociological trends and I'm not quite sure why but trying

21:11.280 --> 21:17.360
to go one level deeper in the psychology of this, I've often wondered whether there are

21:17.360 --> 21:28.240
people who are wired with a Stoic inclination and for them, Stoicism comes easily.

21:28.240 --> 21:29.960
I think I am that way.

21:29.960 --> 21:35.560
I think I'm a person for whom I've always lived in a low-grade Stoic fashion and it

21:35.560 --> 21:42.440
was only late in life when I discovered somebody's already thought this through carefully.

21:42.440 --> 21:49.520
I get emails from people who will reveal to me, they'll say, ï¿½I've always been a Stoic.

21:49.520 --> 21:55.760
I just didn't have a fancy name for what I was.ï¿½ Well, more power to you and even

21:55.760 --> 22:08.400
if you are a congenital Stoic, you still stand to benefit from the ancient Stoics, the Roman

22:08.400 --> 22:13.520
Stoics in particular because they gave it a lot of thought and you will pick up new

22:13.520 --> 22:20.520
Stoic techniques from them and so you will be able to use this native talent that you

22:20.520 --> 22:25.720
possess, you'll be able to use it much more effectively in shaping your days and shaping

22:25.720 --> 22:26.720
your life.

22:26.720 --> 22:33.240
It seems to me that unlike religions, Stoicism suggests certain strategies as you said and

22:33.240 --> 22:42.400
a framework and tools providing to a Stoic to reach his or her goal compared to religion

22:42.400 --> 22:49.200
that sets very solid and uncompromisable kind of rules.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.760
Would that be a fair assessment?

22:50.760 --> 22:59.320
Yeah, the religion can actually coexist with Stoicism wonderfully and in particular Christianity

22:59.320 --> 23:07.400
has long had a kind of a very hand-in-hand relationship with Stoicism.

23:07.400 --> 23:13.440
Realized Stoicism is concerned with your life.

23:13.440 --> 23:19.000
Christianity is concerned primarily, I would argue and some people would take sides with

23:19.000 --> 23:23.160
this, but I would argue it's concerned with your afterlife.

23:23.160 --> 23:27.440
It says, ï¿½Why should you live a certain way today?ï¿½ Well, you want to go to heaven

23:27.440 --> 23:29.880
or do you want to go to the other place?

23:29.880 --> 23:34.800
Stoics, if you ask them, ï¿½Is there a heaven and a hell?ï¿½ they would say, ï¿½Don't know,

23:34.800 --> 23:40.520
but one thing that's for sure is you're alive now and probably you're going to be alive

23:40.520 --> 23:46.160
for a while and you want that life to be the best possible.ï¿½

23:46.160 --> 23:53.080
So Stoicism actually is quite compatible with Christianity and you can pick other religions

23:53.080 --> 24:00.640
and say the same thing because Stoicism is a psychological strategy by which you can

24:00.640 --> 24:08.600
avoid experiencing negative emotions and if you're a Christian, you'd say, ï¿½Well, that's

24:08.600 --> 24:09.600
great.

24:09.600 --> 24:13.640
That's wonderful.ï¿½ If you did that, you could have both a good life and if you're

24:13.640 --> 24:19.680
a Christian, you could say a good afterlife too, but the Stoics didn't concern themselves

24:19.680 --> 24:20.680
with that.

24:20.680 --> 24:24.080
They didn't have rules, the Stoics didn't have rules.

24:24.080 --> 24:30.200
Christianity has a variety of rules, didn't have rules, Stoics didn't have rules.

24:30.200 --> 24:34.280
They had strategies and let me trot out one at this point.

24:34.280 --> 24:39.400
It's called negative visualization and so what the Stoics suggest that you do as you

24:39.400 --> 24:47.120
go about your daily business, every now and then you set aside a moment in which you think

24:47.120 --> 24:49.880
about how your life could be worse.

24:49.880 --> 24:54.040
Now you don't dwell on how your life could be worse.

24:54.040 --> 25:02.040
You allow yourself to have a flash, a flickering thought about how your life could be worse.

25:02.040 --> 25:06.680
So right now I'm sitting in a chair in a warm room.

25:06.680 --> 25:13.360
It's kind of cold and kind of windy outside where I am and you know what, I'm lucky I

25:13.360 --> 25:14.360
get to be inside.

25:14.360 --> 25:18.260
If I was outside, I'd be cold right now.

25:18.260 --> 25:20.200
That's one example.

25:20.200 --> 25:24.240
Other examples, think about the relationships that are important to you.

25:24.240 --> 25:27.040
Well, those relationships can end.

25:27.040 --> 25:32.600
In fact, those relationships will end because sometimes they terminate while the people

25:32.600 --> 25:37.520
are still alive, but if nothing else, somebody's death, either yours or theirs, is going to

25:37.520 --> 25:41.920
end the relationship.

25:41.920 --> 25:49.160
Or a lot of people just going through that quick exercise will remind you of how important

25:49.160 --> 25:55.280
that relationship is to you and it'll make you value that relationship.

25:55.280 --> 26:01.680
Now some people when they hear this, they're going to think, oh well, if the goal is to

26:01.680 --> 26:07.560
be a happy individual free of negative emotions, that seems like a crazy way to do it.

26:07.560 --> 26:14.280
You're just going to be thinking about death and losing everything you've got and again,

26:14.280 --> 26:15.920
that's not what I'm saying.

26:15.920 --> 26:17.580
You don't dwell on it.

26:17.580 --> 26:23.080
You allow yourself to have a flickering thought of it and then you get back to life and it

26:23.080 --> 26:26.600
can have a profound impact on your psychological state.

26:26.600 --> 26:33.920
I know that's the effect it has on me and I can find myself going from just a person

26:33.920 --> 26:39.960
with a bit of attitude into somebody who is absolutely thankful that I'm living the life

26:39.960 --> 26:46.200
I'm living, surrounded by the people who surround me with what health I've got and you can go

26:46.200 --> 26:52.640
through the whole list because everything could be enormously worse and I'm a lucky

26:52.640 --> 26:55.040
guy.

26:55.040 --> 26:59.580
The reason I brought up religion because I hear some people make the argument that, well,

26:59.580 --> 27:05.540
we are living in a very, as it's been portrayed by certain kind of perspectives, we're living

27:05.540 --> 27:12.080
in a divided kind of a time at least within the Western civilization.

27:12.080 --> 27:16.280
People believe completely different things and they're fighting all the time with each

27:16.280 --> 27:21.920
other online and if you watch the news, you think that the world is coming to an end and

27:21.920 --> 27:26.320
all of that and some people are making the argument that we had certain kind of identity

27:26.320 --> 27:34.360
that was built on the basis of Judeo-Christian teachings and philosophy and rules and frameworks

27:34.360 --> 27:41.240
and we went through a period of atheists being able to express themselves and convincing

27:41.240 --> 27:45.360
basically people that maybe religion is not the best way to approach your life and that's

27:45.360 --> 27:49.960
why we have lost the sense of unity.

27:49.960 --> 27:57.160
We have lost the sense of moral ground upon which everything else is built upon.

27:57.160 --> 28:04.120
I disagree with that but it seems to me that you don't necessarily have to believe in any

28:04.120 --> 28:10.840
kind of monotheistic kind of religion to have ethics and unity with each other.

28:10.840 --> 28:16.240
You can just believe, not believe, but you can practice stoicism for example and grow

28:16.240 --> 28:20.680
yourself individually because the society is a reflection of individuals.

28:20.680 --> 28:24.280
Yeah, I agree with that.

28:24.280 --> 28:26.560
Here's one way to think it through.

28:26.560 --> 28:36.000
So suppose you had two kids and you were watching them and you realized that the two kids had

28:36.000 --> 28:39.320
a chance to steal and eat a doughnut.

28:39.320 --> 28:45.860
I don't know, you fill in your example here and you watch and you see both of them.

28:45.860 --> 28:50.240
This could be an experiment even and you could watch them.

28:50.240 --> 28:57.600
One kid eats a doughnut, another kid sits there and you can see him wrestling with himself

28:57.600 --> 29:02.480
and yet doesn't eat the doughnut, just sits there and leaves it be and then a third kid

29:02.480 --> 29:04.400
also doesn't eat the doughnut.

29:04.400 --> 29:10.200
The first kid obviously doesn't have a whole lot of self-control.

29:10.200 --> 29:13.920
Second kid, you ask him, you didn't eat the doughnut, did you want it?

29:13.920 --> 29:15.920
Oh yeah, yeah, I wanted it bad.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.160
Why didn't you eat it then?

29:17.160 --> 29:18.960
Oh, because I'd get punished.

29:18.960 --> 29:21.960
Somebody would punish me and I don't want to get punished.

29:21.960 --> 29:26.800
Okay, third kid who also didn't eat the doughnut, you ask him, did you want that doughnut?

29:26.800 --> 29:28.160
Oh yeah, it looked delicious.

29:28.160 --> 29:29.160
Why didn't you eat it?

29:29.160 --> 29:31.480
Because it would have been wrong.

29:31.480 --> 29:33.920
Are you worried somebody would have punished you?

29:33.920 --> 29:39.680
And he says no, regardless of whether somebody punished me or not, it would have been wrong.

29:39.680 --> 29:42.240
Now you can take people.

29:42.240 --> 29:49.580
I've made the argument in various contexts that if you need religion to do the right

29:49.580 --> 29:56.960
thing, if you need the threat of punishment from God, you're actually a less moral person

29:56.960 --> 30:01.520
than if you do the right thing because it's the right thing to do.

30:01.520 --> 30:06.780
That if you're doing the right thing not to avoid punishment or not to get praise but

30:06.780 --> 30:12.080
because it's the right thing to do, that I think is a higher level of morality than

30:12.080 --> 30:16.840
somebody who says, Ã¬Well, I did the right thing because if God punishes me, I could

30:16.840 --> 30:21.860
go to hell or I could have really bad luck.Ã® Well, that's a very self-interested kind

30:21.860 --> 30:30.160
of motive and I don't even know if that would count as a moral motive for action.

30:30.160 --> 30:34.060
It's a self-interested motive for action.

30:34.060 --> 30:39.000
One of the questions I keep asking, I bring philosophers and technologists and we talk

30:39.000 --> 30:46.780
about many different areas but I'm very interested in how we are re-interpreting the definition

30:46.780 --> 30:52.420
of humanity through our technological tools and technological advancement, artificial

30:52.420 --> 30:54.640
intelligence being one of them.

30:54.640 --> 31:00.340
One of the questions I ask them is that whether they think ethics and morality is subjective

31:00.340 --> 31:06.440
or objective because some believe that to create a more aligned artificial intelligence

31:06.440 --> 31:11.080
with the rest of our civilization, we need to interject some of our ethics and morality

31:11.080 --> 31:12.440
within that system.

31:12.440 --> 31:19.840
But the question is if we really have any clear idea or clear agreement on what is it

31:19.840 --> 31:24.060
exactly that we are calling ethics and morality because it seems to be different from society

31:24.060 --> 31:27.920
to society, from communities to communities.

31:27.920 --> 31:34.240
Well, I think it's objective what morality is and then it turns into a very interesting

31:34.240 --> 31:41.240
conversation of how you arrive at the ethical truths but I've always thought that the fact

31:41.240 --> 31:47.320
that you have a culture where everybody agrees that something is okay to do is by no means

31:47.320 --> 31:52.320
an indication that that's the moral, the right thing to do.

31:52.320 --> 31:57.840
So for instance, in the United States in 1860, slavery in the deep south, if you went to

31:57.840 --> 32:03.380
Mississippi, everybody would have said, ï¿½Yeah, this is what God wants us to do.

32:03.380 --> 32:07.120
This is the right thing to do.ï¿½ In fact, some of the slaves would have even bought

32:07.120 --> 32:11.640
into that, ï¿½Well, it's the color of my skin, which means that this is my place to

32:11.640 --> 32:17.080
be the slave.ï¿½ My reaction to that is, ï¿½They were just wrong.

32:17.080 --> 32:24.160
They were mistaken.ï¿½ You know, there are different devices that you can use to try

32:24.160 --> 32:28.360
to make that point or to try to convince somebody of that point.

32:28.360 --> 32:35.180
One of them is suppose I told you, ï¿½So if you just think it's the culture, then suppose

32:35.180 --> 32:43.000
I told you that I had some kind of special powers and I could beam you back in time to

32:43.000 --> 32:49.640
Mississippi in 1860 and then which body you would inhabit back then was a matter of chance.ï¿½

32:49.640 --> 32:53.880
So you know what, you could be a slave owner, you could be a slave.

32:53.880 --> 32:56.080
Would you agree to that?

32:56.080 --> 33:02.840
Would you say, ï¿½Yeah, sure, send me there.ï¿½ Or would you come up with a different destination?

33:02.840 --> 33:08.840
You know, a place where they didn't have slavery and where people were treated with respect

33:08.840 --> 33:13.600
and their property was respected and most people would say, ï¿½Well, that's a no-brainer.

33:13.600 --> 33:18.320
I'm not going to go to the first place.ï¿½ You know, there's this notion that's come

33:18.320 --> 33:23.880
up that you're not supposed to be judgmental of other people.

33:23.880 --> 33:29.800
And I don't regard that ï¿½ I mean you have a choice if you're a moral person.

33:29.800 --> 33:35.160
You have a choice of first of all doing the right thing yourself and then second choice

33:35.160 --> 33:39.640
of whether to comment on other people's morality.

33:39.640 --> 33:44.040
I think there are probably times when to be a moral person you have to comment on other

33:44.040 --> 33:53.240
people's morality because it's one way to prevent injustice to your fellow human beings.

33:53.240 --> 34:02.680
Yeah, but then online, you go online and people are highly judgmental, partly because the

34:02.680 --> 34:07.200
internet lets them do it from behind a veil of anonymity.

34:07.200 --> 34:14.160
So they can try to wreck somebody's day or life without danger of any kind of blowback

34:14.160 --> 34:15.160
to themselves.

34:15.160 --> 34:21.080
Aside from being judgmental, a lot of people seem to have capitalized on the sense of victimhood

34:21.080 --> 34:22.500
as well.

34:22.500 --> 34:28.120
Even if it's not about them necessarily, like you mentioned slavery.

34:28.120 --> 34:33.200
Some people are saying that because our ancestors were slaves, we deserve to receive special

34:33.200 --> 34:39.000
kind of rights or a special kind of treatment or any other kind of an individual because

34:39.000 --> 34:43.980
all of us, we can't find something to feel victimized about and it seems to have been

34:43.980 --> 34:51.600
made into an instrument of asking for special rights and gaining power and in many cases

34:51.600 --> 34:52.600
political power.

34:52.600 --> 34:58.920
Yeah, so you've raised two separate issues there.

34:58.920 --> 35:06.740
One is the whole issue of being a victim and the Stoics would be very clear on this.

35:06.740 --> 35:12.520
They would say, you get to choose whether you're a victim or not.

35:12.520 --> 35:16.840
You don't get to choose whether you're a target of injustice or not.

35:16.840 --> 35:20.840
So there can be times in life when somebody makes you the target of injustice and they're

35:20.840 --> 35:28.680
very powerful individuals and what they want happens and you've been targeted and bad

35:28.680 --> 35:30.240
things have been done to you.

35:30.240 --> 35:34.360
But they said, that's something we don't have control over.

35:34.360 --> 35:40.480
So that's how it worked for you but there's something you have considerable control over

35:40.480 --> 35:44.400
and that is whether you choose to play the role of victim.

35:44.400 --> 35:49.340
In playing the role of victim, you're going to sit around and say, it's so sad and my

35:49.340 --> 35:54.400
life is so miserable and they've wrecked my life and there's nothing left to it.

35:54.400 --> 36:00.880
If you look back at the ancient Stoics themselves, the Roman Stoics again are my favorite.

36:00.880 --> 36:06.120
A lot of them managed to get themselves into trouble and so they would have been exiled.

36:06.120 --> 36:10.840
In some cases, they would have been executed and what's interesting and it would have been

36:10.840 --> 36:15.960
unjust but what's interesting is how well they took it.

36:15.960 --> 36:26.000
So Musonius Rufus, who's one of the lesser Roman Stoics was exiled to one of the least

36:26.000 --> 36:30.040
desirable places and so what did he do on the island?

36:30.040 --> 36:31.640
He made the most of it.

36:31.640 --> 36:40.080
He realized, oh, I've been targeted but I'm not going to play the role of victim.

36:40.080 --> 36:45.840
I'm going to take what I've got where I am and I'm going to do with it what I can, which

36:45.840 --> 36:49.880
is a wonderful kind of approach.

36:49.880 --> 36:56.320
The second sort of thing you triggered my thinking about is there is a claim, for instance,

36:56.320 --> 37:02.440
that some people say that there should be restitution for slavery.

37:02.440 --> 37:09.960
So if they have ancestors who were slaves, then that entitled them to some kind of restitution

37:09.960 --> 37:15.520
and that's an interesting claim and you can weigh the merits of that claim.

37:15.520 --> 37:20.360
But one of the things to keep in mind is a lot of the people who have ancestors who were

37:20.360 --> 37:24.120
slaves also have ancestors who were slave owners.

37:24.120 --> 37:31.680
Thomas Jefferson had perhaps six children by a slave, Sally Hemings, a slave and then

37:31.680 --> 37:39.320
you can follow their lines of descent down to people who currently exist and they can

37:39.320 --> 37:46.040
all say, yeah, Sally Hemings is a slave, is an ancestor of mine and then there's this

37:46.040 --> 37:49.600
interesting follow-up, well, so was Thomas Jefferson.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.120
He was a slave owner.

37:51.120 --> 37:52.600
He was also a president.

37:52.600 --> 38:00.840
So you're going to encounter these practical difficulties when it comes to reparations

38:00.840 --> 38:01.840
for slavery.

38:01.840 --> 38:06.760
Yeah, I guess a lot of people who are victimizing themselves, they don't even want to get to

38:06.760 --> 38:08.360
those places.

38:08.360 --> 38:14.040
Once you start talking about logical grounds, they just call you names and shut off the

38:14.040 --> 38:17.040
conversation.

38:17.040 --> 38:18.620
That's an unfortunate thing.

38:18.620 --> 38:27.320
My next research project is on critical thinking and the kind of psychology that's in play.

38:27.320 --> 38:34.200
When you try to have a conversation with somebody, it's just worse than ever of them thinking

38:34.200 --> 38:39.040
they don't actually need to get reasons for what they believe that if you come up with

38:39.040 --> 38:43.720
good reasons on your side, then the proper response is simply to shut you up or shout

38:43.720 --> 38:45.680
you down.

38:45.680 --> 38:51.120
That's unfortunate because we need all the thinking we can.

38:51.120 --> 38:57.440
It could save us from some real bad situations in the world.

38:57.440 --> 38:58.440
Absolutely.

38:58.440 --> 39:03.000
Bill's new book is called The Stoic Challenge of Philosopher's Guide to Becoming Tougher,

39:03.000 --> 39:05.760
Calmer, and More Resilient.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.760
Let's discuss some of the strategies.

39:07.760 --> 39:09.600
You mentioned two of them.

39:09.600 --> 39:12.960
What are some of the strategies that you would like to share with people who are living in

39:12.960 --> 39:17.680
this day and age and dealing with everything that we have to deal with in this modern life

39:17.680 --> 39:19.840
that we are experiencing?

39:19.840 --> 39:27.040
One of them I mentioned is this negative visualization.

39:27.040 --> 39:32.040
You give yourself a moment to think about how things could be worse.

39:32.040 --> 39:34.280
There are other variants on that.

39:34.280 --> 39:40.880
One of the things you can realize if you're just having a nothing day, dragging through

39:40.880 --> 39:47.820
a day, realize that whatever that you're doing, one thing to keep in mind is there will be

39:47.820 --> 39:52.640
a last time to do, you will do whatever you're doing.

39:52.640 --> 39:59.640
I use this sometimes when I'm out on a hot summer day, I have to go out and mow the lawn,

39:59.640 --> 40:06.400
so I go out to mow the lawn and I can do that, thinking, ï¿½Man, this is no fun at all and

40:06.400 --> 40:08.600
I wish I didn't have to do this.ï¿½

40:08.600 --> 40:14.360
Then, another thought to entertain when you're doing it is the realization that there will

40:14.360 --> 40:18.240
be a last time in your life that you mow the lawn.

40:18.240 --> 40:23.480
This could be it.

40:23.480 --> 40:28.060
If you live long enough, there will be a time in your life when you will look back and wish

40:28.060 --> 40:32.400
you were young and healthy enough to be mowing a lawn.

40:32.400 --> 40:38.040
You're living right now the dream world of the future you.

40:38.040 --> 40:43.240
This assumes that you live long enough because with the passage of time, you're going to

40:43.240 --> 40:48.280
lose abilities, things are going to happen.

40:48.280 --> 40:50.160
Look back at your own youth.

40:50.160 --> 40:54.800
Look at all the things you could do when you were 15 that you can't do now, the things

40:54.800 --> 40:57.800
that just came so easily to you.

40:57.800 --> 41:00.320
If you could be young again, wouldn't that be great?

41:00.320 --> 41:04.720
Well, if you live long enough, you're going to have that same fantasy.

41:04.720 --> 41:10.280
Only if you could be young again means whatever age you are now.

41:10.280 --> 41:18.120
In my case, if I live to be 100, I'll think back to when I was 67.

41:18.120 --> 41:22.520
I'll look back and say, ï¿½Boy, if I could only have those years over again.ï¿½

41:22.520 --> 41:24.240
Well, I've got them.

41:24.240 --> 41:25.720
I'm living them.

41:25.720 --> 41:29.800
You know what, I should take full advantage of them.

41:29.800 --> 41:33.640
I should soak up what they have to offer.

41:33.640 --> 41:43.200
Another strategy to use if you're a Stoic is when things happen to you in life and you're

41:43.200 --> 41:50.620
thinking, ï¿½How should I respond to the things that have happened?ï¿½ The primary thing to

41:50.620 --> 41:55.700
keep in mind is you ask yourself, ï¿½Well, what do I have control over?ï¿½ The Stoics

41:55.700 --> 42:02.160
were very clear on the importance of you in your life keeping distinguish the things you

42:02.160 --> 42:05.960
have control over and the things you don't have control over.

42:05.960 --> 42:10.800
Their advice is you need to be worrying about things you do have control over because you

42:10.800 --> 42:13.360
have control over them.

42:13.360 --> 42:17.240
The things you don't have control over, you're just wasting your time.

42:17.240 --> 42:20.560
You're causing yourself needless grief, needless anxiety.

42:20.560 --> 42:24.580
Let me give you a concrete example of this.

42:24.580 --> 42:31.440
Suppose you're a competitive tennis player and you're coming up on some important match

42:31.440 --> 42:36.080
and then the question is, ï¿½What should you do to prepare for it?ï¿½ A lot of people will

42:36.080 --> 42:41.520
just burn up a time and energy, psychic energy, thinking about the other side and thinking

42:41.520 --> 42:47.120
about how worried they are about what the other side is going to do.

42:47.120 --> 42:54.520
Stoic advice, if you had a tennis coach who is a Stoic, here's the advice you'd get.

42:54.520 --> 42:57.280
Think about the things you can't control.

42:57.280 --> 43:01.020
You can't control the game they're going to play.

43:01.020 --> 43:02.880
You can't control how good they are.

43:02.880 --> 43:06.040
You can't control how strong they are.

43:06.040 --> 43:07.520
Don't think about it.

43:07.520 --> 43:08.860
What can you control?

43:08.860 --> 43:11.860
You can control how hard you practice.

43:11.860 --> 43:16.580
You can control your strategy going into the game.

43:16.580 --> 43:21.760
If you have any sense at all, you're going to take your time, your energy, focusing on

43:21.760 --> 43:29.520
the things you can control and you're going to prepare, train to the best of your ability.

43:29.520 --> 43:34.240
You're going to go in with the best game strategy you can think of.

43:34.240 --> 43:35.240
You know what?

43:35.240 --> 43:37.800
If that doesn't do it, what else could?

43:37.800 --> 43:38.800
Nothing could.

43:38.800 --> 43:43.840
If that doesn't win you the game, then winning the game just wasn't in the cards.

43:43.840 --> 43:49.160
But it's certainly possible for you to lose a game that you could have won if you allow

43:49.160 --> 43:53.880
yourself to be distracted by the things you have no control over.

43:53.880 --> 43:55.520
It's a waste of time.

43:55.520 --> 43:57.520
It's a waste of energy.

43:57.520 --> 44:02.760
The Stoics would go on to point out that among the things you have control over, you have

44:02.760 --> 44:10.640
very great or even absolute control over many of your own personality traits and character

44:10.640 --> 44:12.840
traits.

44:12.840 --> 44:19.920
For instance, to be honest, it's a choice you can make and you have it in your control,

44:19.920 --> 44:21.300
so you should make it.

44:21.300 --> 44:26.040
To be a caring individual is something you can decide to do.

44:26.040 --> 44:32.520
May not come naturally to you, but you can decide to do it and it will affect your life,

44:32.520 --> 44:38.120
the quality of your life, it will affect your relationships.

44:38.120 --> 44:42.560
The idea though, do you have control over whether somebody becomes your friend or not?

44:42.560 --> 44:48.240
Well, you can affect whether somebody becomes a friend or not, but you can't control it.

44:48.240 --> 44:55.320
So the Stoics analysis, we waste so much of our time thinking or dwelling on things we

44:55.320 --> 45:00.160
can't control and that's stupid because we can't control them.

45:00.160 --> 45:03.920
So those are examples of their strategy.

45:03.920 --> 45:10.280
When I look back at the advice they give and I realize it was only in the second half of

45:10.280 --> 45:16.080
the 20th century that psychologists started thinking in these same terms and they developed

45:16.080 --> 45:19.880
some of the same strategies as the Stoics had.

45:19.880 --> 45:22.160
One of them is this whole notion of framing.

45:22.160 --> 45:29.720
So in my book, The Stoic Challenge, it's about setbacks and when you experience a setback

45:29.720 --> 45:35.160
in life, some people when they do, that's it, that's the end of the game.

45:35.160 --> 45:41.960
They just say, oh no, I got setback so I give up, other people when setback have the ability

45:41.960 --> 45:47.960
to bounce back and overcome the setbacks they're experiencing.

45:47.960 --> 45:52.200
Part of the question is how you frame a setback.

45:52.200 --> 45:58.440
If you're setback and you respond by playing the role of victim, well that's too bad.

45:58.440 --> 46:03.360
It's going to be a personally tragic thing for you.

46:03.360 --> 46:08.840
But when you're setback, if you instead say, well, it's not a setback, it's a challenge

46:08.840 --> 46:13.920
and it's a challenge I'm going to do my best to rise to.

46:13.920 --> 46:20.240
Interestingly if you look at some of the world's most successful people, you'll find that

46:20.240 --> 46:28.180
one of the things that's true of them is the remarkable number of failures they experienced.

46:28.180 --> 46:33.340
So success typically arises out of multiple failures and you can look at successful athletes

46:33.340 --> 46:39.240
and you can look at successful business people, this seems to be true.

46:39.240 --> 46:46.320
It's the case that they were setback on what made the difference, they bounced.

46:46.320 --> 46:52.520
They found a workaround or they just said, hey, I failed, let's see, what can I learn

46:52.520 --> 46:58.080
from that failure because I'm going to take a new approach, different approach where I

46:58.080 --> 47:02.440
might make new mistakes but I'm not going to make that same mistake again and it turns

47:02.440 --> 47:08.160
out that that approach to life can have a huge impact on where you end up in life.

47:08.160 --> 47:09.240
I totally agree.

47:09.240 --> 47:14.920
The example that you used for the athletes immediately reminded me of sumo and sumo wrestling.

47:14.920 --> 47:21.040
I love sumo and I'm following it and beside watching it as a beautiful sport, a part of

47:21.040 --> 47:26.640
it has always for me has always been how these guys are focused on their match that day and

47:26.640 --> 47:29.200
when you're talking to them that, okay, what happened?

47:29.200 --> 47:32.480
They're talking about, okay, this is what happened and are you thinking about championship

47:32.480 --> 47:37.880
and every single time they're saying, I'm just focused on my next match and I'm focused

47:37.880 --> 47:42.560
on doing the best sumo that I can do.

47:42.560 --> 47:49.720
If your best isn't good enough, you do not need to regret, you do not need to apologize,

47:49.720 --> 47:55.260
you did your best but of course most people fall short of doing their best because they

47:55.260 --> 48:01.120
fear failure and this notion of you don't go out of your way to fail but you realize

48:01.120 --> 48:07.000
that if you're doing something hard, failure is a possibility.

48:07.000 --> 48:10.880
It's maybe even a likelihood if you're doing something really hard.

48:10.880 --> 48:18.280
The stoics went out of their way to do hard things just because they were hard and for

48:18.280 --> 48:25.520
them, the idea that resilience didn't necessarily just come naturally, that it's something

48:25.520 --> 48:34.120
you could develop and the way to develop it was to experience difficult, unpleasant, uncomfortable

48:34.120 --> 48:41.100
situations and then deal with the setbacks those situations presented.

48:41.100 --> 48:47.360
You walk away a stronger human being, somebody who is more self-confident, somebody who has

48:47.360 --> 48:52.920
the ability to bounce instead of break when life presents them with a setback.

48:52.920 --> 48:58.000
And I'm glad that we started this conversation with you saying that you became in stoic after

48:58.000 --> 49:02.900
40, that you got into Zen and stoicism after 40 so it's not like people have to get into

49:02.900 --> 49:08.360
it early in their life otherwise they're going to miss out on understanding a point of it

49:08.360 --> 49:09.360
or anything like that.

49:09.360 --> 49:13.040
At any point, I would imagine it doesn't matter what age you are, it's just a matter of perspective

49:13.040 --> 49:14.040
and the will.

49:14.040 --> 49:15.600
Is that right?

49:15.600 --> 49:18.320
Yeah, I agree with that entirely.

49:18.320 --> 49:25.080
I had assumed that stoicism worked best for older people but I have subsequently found

49:25.080 --> 49:29.000
that that is very much a mistake.

49:29.000 --> 49:35.400
I think you have to have experienced some challenges in life in order to really appreciate

49:35.400 --> 49:45.240
what stoicism has to offer but there are people challenged at any ages you can name.

49:45.240 --> 49:54.960
So sure, young and old alike and the strategies again work at all ages.

49:54.960 --> 49:59.360
Adolescence has its own challenges and they're really tough challenges if you think back

49:59.360 --> 50:04.600
of how hard it was to be a teenager.

50:04.600 --> 50:10.960
So maybe they're a ripe audience for this but first of all they have to know that it

50:10.960 --> 50:15.800
exists and they have to want to put it to work in their life.

50:15.800 --> 50:20.880
What are some of the resources you would recommend for stoicism aside from your books?

50:20.880 --> 50:29.960
Well, let's see, I've read a lot of psychology and so there are modern behavioral psychologists

50:29.960 --> 50:35.720
who have looked into the same things that the stoics were talking about.

50:35.720 --> 50:44.720
So somebody who was interested primarily in the psychology that lies behind the strategies

50:44.720 --> 50:52.320
could look at, let's see, there's the book Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman.

50:52.320 --> 50:59.360
It's a wonderful book and what he's done is very carefully through careful psychological

50:59.360 --> 51:02.160
experimentation.

51:02.160 --> 51:09.120
And his colleague whose name I'm blanking on right now did experiments in which they

51:09.120 --> 51:16.080
tested out a number of psychological strategies in order to see the tricks the human mind

51:16.080 --> 51:22.160
plays on us and more importantly the way to avoid those tricks.

51:22.160 --> 51:26.200
So that's a useful thing to read.

51:26.200 --> 51:35.600
The stoics themselves, even though they're philosophers, a lot of philosophy is simply

51:35.600 --> 51:42.760
very difficult for a non-philosopher to read but that's not true of the stoics.

51:42.760 --> 51:49.240
Marcus Aurelius, his Meditations, it's just his notebook, wasn't intended for publication,

51:49.240 --> 51:58.120
just a notebook of observations about what he sees in life and how people can deal with

51:58.120 --> 52:00.080
the challenges life presents.

52:00.080 --> 52:10.600
So he has a lot of fans, he's got to be the best selling of the stoics.

52:10.600 --> 52:22.320
And there's books, Massimo Pugliese's How to Be a Stoic is a wonderful book.

52:22.320 --> 52:28.800
And in each of the books I've written I have a section of recommended reading so they can

52:28.800 --> 52:30.520
check that as well.

52:30.520 --> 52:31.520
Excellent.

52:31.520 --> 52:35.720
Bill's new book is called The Stoic Challenge of Philosopher's Guide to Becoming Tougher,

52:35.720 --> 52:37.720
Calmer and More Resilient.

52:37.720 --> 52:42.260
You mentioned that next you're going to do a study about how to have conversations.

52:42.260 --> 52:48.240
What is next for you aside from that and where can people follow your work?

52:48.240 --> 52:49.240
Let's see.

52:49.240 --> 52:52.800
I have a website, williambervin.com.

52:52.800 --> 52:53.800
You're not on Twitter though, right?

52:53.800 --> 52:54.800
I couldn't find your Twitter.

52:54.800 --> 52:58.720
No, I'm a geezer.

52:58.720 --> 53:04.080
And I'm realizing more than ever how my world has changed.

53:04.080 --> 53:12.280
The first book that I published would have been in the early 2000s and it was a physical

53:12.280 --> 53:19.080
paper manuscript and I would send it back and forth to the editor and it would be this

53:19.080 --> 53:25.940
huge box, paper three inches thick and there would be this time lag between when you did

53:25.940 --> 53:27.360
it and when you came back.

53:27.360 --> 53:35.680
Now, it's all electronic and the book I'm currently working on, I'm making a goal that

53:35.680 --> 53:42.360
there will be no paper that I consume in the production of the book so it's just all on

53:42.360 --> 53:43.500
word processor.

53:43.500 --> 53:49.960
But the other thing I'm realizing is it used to be that in order to successfully sell a

53:49.960 --> 53:56.840
book, you needed to get book reviews and the book reviews to a considerable extent have

53:56.840 --> 53:58.680
become secondary.

53:58.680 --> 54:04.280
Now a sensible author, I'm not a sensible author but if I were, I'd be working social

54:04.280 --> 54:09.080
media and I'd have a Facebook page and I would be Twittering and I would be doing all of

54:09.080 --> 54:17.720
this other stuff and I should be but yeah, just I'm from the wrong generation apparently

54:17.720 --> 54:24.520
which is no excuse at all.

54:24.520 --> 54:29.940
And following me, I don't know, you know the notion of followers and again if I want

54:29.940 --> 54:36.880
to sell books, I'm talking terrible but the notion of followers, well if you want to follow

54:36.880 --> 54:42.080
me, read what I've written and that's the best of me that there is because I spend a

54:42.080 --> 54:49.440
lot of time carefully choosing words and putting them down for the world to consume but yeah,

54:49.440 --> 54:57.520
there are people who are followed on a daily basis by vast numbers of people which is one

54:57.520 --> 55:04.800
of these social phenomena that I don't really understand but I'm an outlier so I'm to blame.

55:04.800 --> 55:13.000
I realize that that's just an issue I have but certainly one of the things they can do

55:13.000 --> 55:22.680
if they want to dip a toe into Stoicism, so on the Stoic website, WilliamBIrvin.com, I

55:22.680 --> 55:28.040
have a whole bunch of Stoic essays that I've written and these are typically like 900 word

55:28.040 --> 55:33.680
things that are available for free and you can take a look at them and it's practical

55:33.680 --> 55:40.960
advice of Stoicism in your daily life, what sorts of things can it do for you and so that

55:40.960 --> 55:46.240
would be an interesting way for them to dip in a toe and see if they like the water.

55:46.240 --> 55:47.240
Excellent.

55:47.240 --> 55:50.080
It certainly has been a pleasure talking to you.

55:50.080 --> 55:54.880
Let me ask you the last question that I ask all my guests that if you come across an intelligent

55:54.880 --> 55:58.960
alien from a different civilization, what would you say the greatest thing that we have

55:58.960 --> 56:05.040
done as humanity and what would you say is our worst achievement?

56:05.040 --> 56:13.760
Worst achievement is our inhumanity to each other which expresses itself routinely and

56:13.760 --> 56:19.080
you take almost any culture, it's interesting to try to find exceptions to this and there

56:19.080 --> 56:26.960
have been these periods of time when a bunch of people in the same place have gone crazy.

56:26.960 --> 56:31.600
Let's say Germany, oh yeah, there was that World War I thing and that World War II thing.

56:31.600 --> 56:32.600
What about France?

56:32.600 --> 56:39.520
Oh yeah, the French Revolution where people were being beheaded.

56:39.520 --> 56:40.520
What about Rwanda?

56:40.520 --> 56:46.240
Oh yeah, there was that little incident when neighbors started killing neighbors and about

56:46.240 --> 56:50.040
what a third of the population died.

56:50.040 --> 56:52.840
What about the United States?

56:52.840 --> 57:02.560
Well, there was slavery, there was the witchcraft thing going on and you realize what a share

57:02.560 --> 57:09.360
shallow fragile thing human culture is, how it's possible for people to live side by

57:09.360 --> 57:18.000
side in harmony and then just start killing each other and then the sad thing is, could

57:18.000 --> 57:19.000
it happen again?

57:19.000 --> 57:20.760
Could it happen here in America where I am?

57:20.760 --> 57:26.960
The answer is yes and if we think we're special and different, the answer is no because we

57:26.960 --> 57:29.600
deep down are human beings.

57:29.600 --> 57:33.360
That's the great human tragedy.

57:33.360 --> 57:46.320
On the positive side, we've done some magnificent things as far as helping people is concerned.

57:46.320 --> 57:54.880
We have raised the level of prosperity and this is a mixed blessing of course, but you

57:54.880 --> 58:00.160
think back, where were we 50,000 years ago or 70,000?

58:00.160 --> 58:07.560
We were in the savannas of Africa and look at how far we've come and look at the artistic

58:07.560 --> 58:11.400
productions and the scientific productions.

58:11.400 --> 58:19.760
We are capable, we are gods, we are monsters and we just switch identities with the passage

58:19.760 --> 58:23.920
of time apparently, so bittersweet.

58:23.920 --> 58:25.840
It's a bittersweet state of affairs.
