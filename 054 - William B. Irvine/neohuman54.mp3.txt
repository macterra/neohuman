I've always thought that the fact that you have a culture where everybody agrees that
something is okay to do is by no means an indication that that's the moral, the right
thing to do.
So, for instance, in the United States in 1860, slavery in the deep south, if you went
to Mississippi, everybody would have said, �Yeah, this is what God wants us to do.
This is the right thing to do.� In fact, some of the slaves would have even bought
into that.
That's the color of my skin means that this is my place to be the slave.
My reaction to that is they were just wrong.
They were mistaken.
Hello and welcome to the 54th episode of Neohuman Podcasts.
Today with me, I have the pleasure of having William B. Irvine.
Thank you so much for being with us, William.
Oh, it's a pleasure to be here and please call me Bill.
Bill.
Excellent.
How about we start from the beginning?
The work you've done and what are you mainly focused on now these days, Bill?
Okay, if you want the beginning, let's see.
I'm a philosophy professor at Wright State University.
In 2004, I guess when I turned 40 or 50, I had some kind of midlife crisis and somehow
decided I was going to become a Zen Buddhist, that that was the answer and thought before
doing that of course I needed to do research into Zen Buddhism.
I also thought since I'm a philosophy professor that there might be an interesting way to
get a double out of this and by double what I mean is I would not only resolve my midlife
crisis but I could also get a publication out of it.
I set about writing a book on human desire and in the process of writing that book, I
got to look into Zen Buddhism.
Buddhism itself is very concerned with human desire and our attempts to curb our desire.
To be complete though, I had to consider other viewpoints on desire and so one of them I
had to do research on was Stoicism.
I didn't have a particular interest in Stoicism.
My only exposure to it in college, one of my majors was in philosophy but my only exposure
to the Stoics as a philosophy major was their logic.
It turns out they were some of the preeminent logicians of the ancient world and so I stumbled
across the fact that they also had their own take on human desire and the sources of human
dissatisfaction.
They give practical advice on dealing with desire and how to prevent unhappiness.
I toyed with their advice.
I took their advice to heart for a while and found much to my amazement that it was remarkably
effective and I also looked deeper into Zen Buddhism and found that in Zen Buddhism, now
there are people who will have different interpretations of this, but my takeaway is that what you
were waiting for is a moment of enlightenment.
You had to be a practicing Zen Buddhist for that moment to come and sometimes the moment
would come a day after you started practicing and sometimes you would wait 30 years for
your moment of enlightenment if it came even then.
So it's an interesting choice between trying something and maybe 30 years from now having
it work or doing Stoic techniques and having them work very quickly.
For me, it was an easy choice and also I seem to have an aptitude for the Stoic mindset.
That research came out in a book published in 2004 called On Desire, Why We Want What
We Want and I immediately decided I was going to follow that with a Stoic book and that
became my book, A Guide to the Good Life, The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy, which was published
I think in 2006 and I did not have any clue that the world would have an interest in reading
such a book.
I thought there might be a dozen people on the planet, but I thought it had to be written
and so I wrote it and it got off to a slow start but has done very well since then and
more than 10 years later continues to do very well just in terms of sales and the number
of people reached.
I consider myself a teacher so in that case, I take the book to be an example of teaching,
of reaching people and showing them the role philosophy can play in their life and as a
result of that, I've done other books subsequently on Stoicism including most recently my book
titled The Stoic Challenge.
And your new book is called The Stoic Challenge, A Philosopher's Guide to Becoming Tougher,
Calmer and More Resilient.
You mentioned the point and objective of enlightenment with respect to Zen Buddhism.
My understanding of Zen has always been that I think Alan Watts has a quote talking about
in Zen the point of peeling the potato is not to make a stew or something, the point
is just to peel the potato.
Now have you had any kind of a challenge about reaching certain kind of a goal and objective
rather than just focusing on being in the moment with both Zen and Stoicism because
just based on the title of your book, The Stoic Challenge is being introduced for the
purpose of becoming tougher, calmer and more resilient.
I guess one of the things that struck me when I did the research for the book on desire
was this notion of a philosophy of life or you could also call it a philosophy for living
and what such a philosophy does is it tells you what the primary goal, your ultimate goal
in living should be and Buddhism defines that goal as what they call tranquility and you
have to be careful because that's a word that could be misunderstood.
It doesn't mean a kind of a zoned out state like being on tranquilizers.
What it means is a life with as few negative emotions as possible, negative emotions, things
like envy, anger, anxiety and a philosophy of life will embrace positive emotions, emotions
like delight and even joy but it will give you a goal to aim at and I was first struck
that both the Stoics and the Buddhists agreed on the ultimate goal of life that they said
if you have sense what you're going to aim for in life is not fame and fortune, it's
not going to be the things and most people don't even have a coherent philosophy of
life, they just live day to day.
They know their goal of the day or their goal of the hour or their goal of the minute but
they don't have some bigger goal lurking behind those.
But the Stoics and the Buddhists both agreed with this goal of tranquility in the sense
I've described.
So what makes them different philosophies of life?
Well they have remarkably different strategies for attaining that goal.
So if you're a Zen Buddhist, you do lots of meditation for instance and you do try
to stay in the moment you do that kind of practice and that's all very useful.
In fact, I'm engaged in a course right now of meditation of that kind.
But with the Stoics, it's a completely different approach so it isn't a lot of meditation
involved rather it's ways to respond with the interesting situations that life presents
you with and it's also about staying grateful for the life you find yourself living.
And then if you'd like, we can discuss some of their strategies but that's one of the
principal things to keep in mind.
First, the notion of a philosophy of life provides you with a goal and provides you
with strategies and one of the primary Buddhist strategies is meditation, mindfulness and
that can play a role in Stoicism but it isn't the role that the Stoics played up.
Yeah, I definitely want to discuss the strategies but before that, let's define what Stoicism
is and where it's coming from and what is the definition of Stoicism today if you see
it as different than it used to be when it started thousands of years ago.
Okay, well Stoicism came into existence in about 300 BC.
A philosopher named Zeno of Citium decided he wanted to become a philosopher and so he
studied under various other philosophers.
He figured that was the best way to do it and in the process of doing so, he was exposed
to a variety of philosophies including philosophies of life like skepticism and cynicism and
after a while decided he wanted to form his own philosophy of life and what he was going
to do is blend together some of the other philosophies he had encountered.
So back then, we didn't have universities but you did have people who would become private
teachers for other people.
They would set up their own school of philosophy and Zeno did that and he was a Greek and so
he set up what became the Greek school of Stoicism and again if you say what is Stoicism,
it's a philosophy but interestingly, he had other aspects to it.
So besides being interested in the role, the idea of living a good life, he was also very
much interested in logic.
He was interested in science and that wasn't unusual in the philosophers back then.
The people they would have as students would typically have multiple kinds of goals in
being students so a lot of them were young adults preparing for careers in law or careers
in politics and for those students, the logic would come in handy but he thought to have
a good life is more than just that you succeed at your job, you need a bigger game plan for
succeeding at life so he also provided his students with a philosophy for living.
Most of the writings of the Greek Stoics have been lost unfortunately but in the first century
AD, the doctrine was brought to Rome and the Romans took it up and made it their own.
My primary interest in Stoicism is in Roman Stoicism and it's connected with names that
a lot of people can have encountered so I mentioned Zeno of Sidium, most people have
never heard of him but if you say what about Marcus Aurelius, oh yeah, he was a Stoic and
he wrote this book called The Meditations, now again misleading title because for him
it didn't involve the kind of mindfulness meditation that as in Buddhist would do or
people like Seneca who is quite an interesting person, he's currently my favorite of the
Stoic philosophers, he was not only a philosopher but he was a counselor to an emperor, he was
a playwright, he was a scientist and he was also the first century equivalent of a billionaire
so he was quite a guy.
Now Marcus Aurelius of course besides being a Stoic was himself an emperor so you have
these people who are mixing together Stoicism with other aspects of life and that's kind
of Stoicism that I think is most attractive to citizens of the 21st century, we have complicated
lives we're living and then the goal is okay and what is success?
One measure of success is having a good life and then what counts is having a good life
and the Roman Stoics following in the footsteps of the Greek Stoics gave an answer to that,
they told us well you need to pursue tranquility in the sense that I've described and they
said and here's how you do that.
You mentioned different types of Stoicism, Greek Stoicism and Roman Stoicism, what are
the difference between the two?
The Romans I think have a much bigger emphasis on these strategies, these psychological strategies
so I mentioned that the Stoics had diverse interests but they were the leading I think
they were the leading psychologists of their time and they had insights into the way the
human mind works, usually if you're an unhappy person you have only yourself to blame, you're
choosing the wrong goals and then when you reach those goals you're no better off than
you were before and so they had insight into human psychology and the Greeks seem to be
more interested in simply in virtue.
Roman Stoics were interested in that but they have this whole psychological angle that I
think is very attractive to many modern people who try it.
We are right now experiencing a great Stoic Renaissance, the number of people who would
call themselves practicing Stoics, there might have been a handful on the planet when I first
became a Stoic but now it's not unusual to encounter them, certainly not online.
If you're in the Silicon Valley, it turns out that's a hotbed of Stoicism within the
United States surprisingly enough.
When I wrote A Guide to the Good Life, this would be in 2006, I've done the numbers on
this and you can count the number on Amazon, the number of books that have Stoicism in
the title, there were only 40 and most of those were written by academics for fellow
academics so they weren't particularly accessible.
Recently I checked and books on Stoicism on Amazon are coming out at the rate of four
per week so there's this huge upsurge of interest in Stoicism as a philosophy and that's
kind of as it should be because it's very practical minded, gives you usable advice
and whereas if you're going to be a Zen Buddhist, you might take a decade before it really kicks
in.
My line on this is, Stoicism, hey, a three-day weekend, give it a try and you'll know by
the end of that time whether it's working for you or not and judging on the kinds of
emails I get and just the continued sales of Guide to the Good Life, there are a lot
of people for whom it works.
Now between A Guide to the Good Life that you said came out in 2006 and your new book,
The Stoic Challenge that came out earlier this year, it's 13 years of gap and a lot
has changed considering social media and sociopolitical dynamic and how people are communicating with
each other.
How do you see the kind of change that has been developed during that 13 years and how
with Stoicism the relevancy of it has changed from your perspective from then 2006 to now
2019?
I guess in my own activities, I did several other books in that interval.
One of them was another Stoic book titled A Slap in the Face and what it is is it's
an analysis of insults because it turns out the Stoics were experts on insults, on how
to deal effectively with insults.
So that was a book in which I explored the psychology of insults, the politics of insults
and then you finally get to the Stoic advice on how to deal with them which is kind of
fun and kind of interesting and kind of useful.
The best way to deal with an insult is to ignore it.
You will deeply frustrate whoever it is who's trying to insult you and if you have some
wit and some presence of mind, often when you're insulted, it comes as a surprise you
didn't see it coming but if you have some wit, there are other techniques you can use.
One of them favored by the Stoics was you respond by insulting yourself even worse than
the insulter insulted you because that makes the insulter look like an idiot.
You know what you're saying?
Look, if you really knew me, that isn't the character flaw that you would pick.
If you really knew me, you'd realize there are at least five other character flaws that
I have that are much worse than that so you are not well suited to analyze me but thanks
for the effort anyway.
So you turn around the insult and you aim it right back at the source.
But the other question you asked was the growth of interest in Stoicism and I'm not
a sociologist so I can speculate but I don't know but one interesting phenomenon that lately
I've been looking into is at the same time as Stoicism was rising, there was the rising
of what you might call anti-Stoicism.
These aren't people who are opposed to Stoicism but they're people who take the opposite approach
to life.
Stoic will take whatever life offers him and try to make the best out of what life has
offered him.
So the old saying is the glass half full or half empty.
For the Stoic, the glass will be half full and that's only the beginning because he will
say and isn't it wonderful that I have water to drink at all and isn't it wonderful that
we have something like glass that lets you see the water inside and you can wash it and
it will last for a long time.
I must be one of the luckiest people around.
That's a Stoic approach.
Anti-Stoics, these are people who seem to look for things to be unhappy about.
They look for sources of things that they can complain about and complain about how
unfair it is and then declare to the world how their soul has been crushed by this injustice
that's been done them.
That's another one of these sociological trends and I'm not quite sure why but trying
to go one level deeper in the psychology of this, I've often wondered whether there are
people who are wired with a Stoic inclination and for them, Stoicism comes easily.
I think I am that way.
I think I'm a person for whom I've always lived in a low-grade Stoic fashion and it
was only late in life when I discovered somebody's already thought this through carefully.
I get emails from people who will reveal to me, they'll say, �I've always been a Stoic.
I just didn't have a fancy name for what I was.� Well, more power to you and even
if you are a congenital Stoic, you still stand to benefit from the ancient Stoics, the Roman
Stoics in particular because they gave it a lot of thought and you will pick up new
Stoic techniques from them and so you will be able to use this native talent that you
possess, you'll be able to use it much more effectively in shaping your days and shaping
your life.
It seems to me that unlike religions, Stoicism suggests certain strategies as you said and
a framework and tools providing to a Stoic to reach his or her goal compared to religion
that sets very solid and uncompromisable kind of rules.
Would that be a fair assessment?
Yeah, the religion can actually coexist with Stoicism wonderfully and in particular Christianity
has long had a kind of a very hand-in-hand relationship with Stoicism.
Realized Stoicism is concerned with your life.
Christianity is concerned primarily, I would argue and some people would take sides with
this, but I would argue it's concerned with your afterlife.
It says, �Why should you live a certain way today?� Well, you want to go to heaven
or do you want to go to the other place?
Stoics, if you ask them, �Is there a heaven and a hell?� they would say, �Don't know,
but one thing that's for sure is you're alive now and probably you're going to be alive
for a while and you want that life to be the best possible.�
So Stoicism actually is quite compatible with Christianity and you can pick other religions
and say the same thing because Stoicism is a psychological strategy by which you can
avoid experiencing negative emotions and if you're a Christian, you'd say, �Well, that's
great.
That's wonderful.� If you did that, you could have both a good life and if you're
a Christian, you could say a good afterlife too, but the Stoics didn't concern themselves
with that.
They didn't have rules, the Stoics didn't have rules.
Christianity has a variety of rules, didn't have rules, Stoics didn't have rules.
They had strategies and let me trot out one at this point.
It's called negative visualization and so what the Stoics suggest that you do as you
go about your daily business, every now and then you set aside a moment in which you think
about how your life could be worse.
Now you don't dwell on how your life could be worse.
You allow yourself to have a flash, a flickering thought about how your life could be worse.
So right now I'm sitting in a chair in a warm room.
It's kind of cold and kind of windy outside where I am and you know what, I'm lucky I
get to be inside.
If I was outside, I'd be cold right now.
That's one example.
Other examples, think about the relationships that are important to you.
Well, those relationships can end.
In fact, those relationships will end because sometimes they terminate while the people
are still alive, but if nothing else, somebody's death, either yours or theirs, is going to
end the relationship.
Or a lot of people just going through that quick exercise will remind you of how important
that relationship is to you and it'll make you value that relationship.
Now some people when they hear this, they're going to think, oh well, if the goal is to
be a happy individual free of negative emotions, that seems like a crazy way to do it.
You're just going to be thinking about death and losing everything you've got and again,
that's not what I'm saying.
You don't dwell on it.
You allow yourself to have a flickering thought of it and then you get back to life and it
can have a profound impact on your psychological state.
I know that's the effect it has on me and I can find myself going from just a person
with a bit of attitude into somebody who is absolutely thankful that I'm living the life
I'm living, surrounded by the people who surround me with what health I've got and you can go
through the whole list because everything could be enormously worse and I'm a lucky
guy.
The reason I brought up religion because I hear some people make the argument that, well,
we are living in a very, as it's been portrayed by certain kind of perspectives, we're living
in a divided kind of a time at least within the Western civilization.
People believe completely different things and they're fighting all the time with each
other online and if you watch the news, you think that the world is coming to an end and
all of that and some people are making the argument that we had certain kind of identity
that was built on the basis of Judeo-Christian teachings and philosophy and rules and frameworks
and we went through a period of atheists being able to express themselves and convincing
basically people that maybe religion is not the best way to approach your life and that's
why we have lost the sense of unity.
We have lost the sense of moral ground upon which everything else is built upon.
I disagree with that but it seems to me that you don't necessarily have to believe in any
kind of monotheistic kind of religion to have ethics and unity with each other.
You can just believe, not believe, but you can practice stoicism for example and grow
yourself individually because the society is a reflection of individuals.
Yeah, I agree with that.
Here's one way to think it through.
So suppose you had two kids and you were watching them and you realized that the two kids had
a chance to steal and eat a doughnut.
I don't know, you fill in your example here and you watch and you see both of them.
This could be an experiment even and you could watch them.
One kid eats a doughnut, another kid sits there and you can see him wrestling with himself
and yet doesn't eat the doughnut, just sits there and leaves it be and then a third kid
also doesn't eat the doughnut.
The first kid obviously doesn't have a whole lot of self-control.
Second kid, you ask him, you didn't eat the doughnut, did you want it?
Oh yeah, yeah, I wanted it bad.
Why didn't you eat it then?
Oh, because I'd get punished.
Somebody would punish me and I don't want to get punished.
Okay, third kid who also didn't eat the doughnut, you ask him, did you want that doughnut?
Oh yeah, it looked delicious.
Why didn't you eat it?
Because it would have been wrong.
Are you worried somebody would have punished you?
And he says no, regardless of whether somebody punished me or not, it would have been wrong.
Now you can take people.
I've made the argument in various contexts that if you need religion to do the right
thing, if you need the threat of punishment from God, you're actually a less moral person
than if you do the right thing because it's the right thing to do.
That if you're doing the right thing not to avoid punishment or not to get praise but
because it's the right thing to do, that I think is a higher level of morality than
somebody who says, ìWell, I did the right thing because if God punishes me, I could
go to hell or I could have really bad luck.î Well, that's a very self-interested kind
of motive and I don't even know if that would count as a moral motive for action.
It's a self-interested motive for action.
One of the questions I keep asking, I bring philosophers and technologists and we talk
about many different areas but I'm very interested in how we are re-interpreting the definition
of humanity through our technological tools and technological advancement, artificial
intelligence being one of them.
One of the questions I ask them is that whether they think ethics and morality is subjective
or objective because some believe that to create a more aligned artificial intelligence
with the rest of our civilization, we need to interject some of our ethics and morality
within that system.
But the question is if we really have any clear idea or clear agreement on what is it
exactly that we are calling ethics and morality because it seems to be different from society
to society, from communities to communities.
Well, I think it's objective what morality is and then it turns into a very interesting
conversation of how you arrive at the ethical truths but I've always thought that the fact
that you have a culture where everybody agrees that something is okay to do is by no means
an indication that that's the moral, the right thing to do.
So for instance, in the United States in 1860, slavery in the deep south, if you went to
Mississippi, everybody would have said, �Yeah, this is what God wants us to do.
This is the right thing to do.� In fact, some of the slaves would have even bought
into that, �Well, it's the color of my skin, which means that this is my place to
be the slave.� My reaction to that is, �They were just wrong.
They were mistaken.� You know, there are different devices that you can use to try
to make that point or to try to convince somebody of that point.
One of them is suppose I told you, �So if you just think it's the culture, then suppose
I told you that I had some kind of special powers and I could beam you back in time to
Mississippi in 1860 and then which body you would inhabit back then was a matter of chance.�
So you know what, you could be a slave owner, you could be a slave.
Would you agree to that?
Would you say, �Yeah, sure, send me there.� Or would you come up with a different destination?
You know, a place where they didn't have slavery and where people were treated with respect
and their property was respected and most people would say, �Well, that's a no-brainer.
I'm not going to go to the first place.� You know, there's this notion that's come
up that you're not supposed to be judgmental of other people.
And I don't regard that � I mean you have a choice if you're a moral person.
You have a choice of first of all doing the right thing yourself and then second choice
of whether to comment on other people's morality.
I think there are probably times when to be a moral person you have to comment on other
people's morality because it's one way to prevent injustice to your fellow human beings.
Yeah, but then online, you go online and people are highly judgmental, partly because the
internet lets them do it from behind a veil of anonymity.
So they can try to wreck somebody's day or life without danger of any kind of blowback
to themselves.
Aside from being judgmental, a lot of people seem to have capitalized on the sense of victimhood
as well.
Even if it's not about them necessarily, like you mentioned slavery.
Some people are saying that because our ancestors were slaves, we deserve to receive special
kind of rights or a special kind of treatment or any other kind of an individual because
all of us, we can't find something to feel victimized about and it seems to have been
made into an instrument of asking for special rights and gaining power and in many cases
political power.
Yeah, so you've raised two separate issues there.
One is the whole issue of being a victim and the Stoics would be very clear on this.
They would say, you get to choose whether you're a victim or not.
You don't get to choose whether you're a target of injustice or not.
So there can be times in life when somebody makes you the target of injustice and they're
very powerful individuals and what they want happens and you've been targeted and bad
things have been done to you.
But they said, that's something we don't have control over.
So that's how it worked for you but there's something you have considerable control over
and that is whether you choose to play the role of victim.
In playing the role of victim, you're going to sit around and say, it's so sad and my
life is so miserable and they've wrecked my life and there's nothing left to it.
If you look back at the ancient Stoics themselves, the Roman Stoics again are my favorite.
A lot of them managed to get themselves into trouble and so they would have been exiled.
In some cases, they would have been executed and what's interesting and it would have been
unjust but what's interesting is how well they took it.
So Musonius Rufus, who's one of the lesser Roman Stoics was exiled to one of the least
desirable places and so what did he do on the island?
He made the most of it.
He realized, oh, I've been targeted but I'm not going to play the role of victim.
I'm going to take what I've got where I am and I'm going to do with it what I can, which
is a wonderful kind of approach.
The second sort of thing you triggered my thinking about is there is a claim, for instance,
that some people say that there should be restitution for slavery.
So if they have ancestors who were slaves, then that entitled them to some kind of restitution
and that's an interesting claim and you can weigh the merits of that claim.
But one of the things to keep in mind is a lot of the people who have ancestors who were
slaves also have ancestors who were slave owners.
Thomas Jefferson had perhaps six children by a slave, Sally Hemings, a slave and then
you can follow their lines of descent down to people who currently exist and they can
all say, yeah, Sally Hemings is a slave, is an ancestor of mine and then there's this
interesting follow-up, well, so was Thomas Jefferson.
He was a slave owner.
He was also a president.
So you're going to encounter these practical difficulties when it comes to reparations
for slavery.
Yeah, I guess a lot of people who are victimizing themselves, they don't even want to get to
those places.
Once you start talking about logical grounds, they just call you names and shut off the
conversation.
That's an unfortunate thing.
My next research project is on critical thinking and the kind of psychology that's in play.
When you try to have a conversation with somebody, it's just worse than ever of them thinking
they don't actually need to get reasons for what they believe that if you come up with
good reasons on your side, then the proper response is simply to shut you up or shout
you down.
That's unfortunate because we need all the thinking we can.
It could save us from some real bad situations in the world.
Absolutely.
Bill's new book is called The Stoic Challenge of Philosopher's Guide to Becoming Tougher,
Calmer, and More Resilient.
Let's discuss some of the strategies.
You mentioned two of them.
What are some of the strategies that you would like to share with people who are living in
this day and age and dealing with everything that we have to deal with in this modern life
that we are experiencing?
One of them I mentioned is this negative visualization.
You give yourself a moment to think about how things could be worse.
There are other variants on that.
One of the things you can realize if you're just having a nothing day, dragging through
a day, realize that whatever that you're doing, one thing to keep in mind is there will be
a last time to do, you will do whatever you're doing.
I use this sometimes when I'm out on a hot summer day, I have to go out and mow the lawn,
so I go out to mow the lawn and I can do that, thinking, �Man, this is no fun at all and
I wish I didn't have to do this.�
Then, another thought to entertain when you're doing it is the realization that there will
be a last time in your life that you mow the lawn.
This could be it.
If you live long enough, there will be a time in your life when you will look back and wish
you were young and healthy enough to be mowing a lawn.
You're living right now the dream world of the future you.
This assumes that you live long enough because with the passage of time, you're going to
lose abilities, things are going to happen.
Look back at your own youth.
Look at all the things you could do when you were 15 that you can't do now, the things
that just came so easily to you.
If you could be young again, wouldn't that be great?
Well, if you live long enough, you're going to have that same fantasy.
Only if you could be young again means whatever age you are now.
In my case, if I live to be 100, I'll think back to when I was 67.
I'll look back and say, �Boy, if I could only have those years over again.�
Well, I've got them.
I'm living them.
You know what, I should take full advantage of them.
I should soak up what they have to offer.
Another strategy to use if you're a Stoic is when things happen to you in life and you're
thinking, �How should I respond to the things that have happened?� The primary thing to
keep in mind is you ask yourself, �Well, what do I have control over?� The Stoics
were very clear on the importance of you in your life keeping distinguish the things you
have control over and the things you don't have control over.
Their advice is you need to be worrying about things you do have control over because you
have control over them.
The things you don't have control over, you're just wasting your time.
You're causing yourself needless grief, needless anxiety.
Let me give you a concrete example of this.
Suppose you're a competitive tennis player and you're coming up on some important match
and then the question is, �What should you do to prepare for it?� A lot of people will
just burn up a time and energy, psychic energy, thinking about the other side and thinking
about how worried they are about what the other side is going to do.
Stoic advice, if you had a tennis coach who is a Stoic, here's the advice you'd get.
Think about the things you can't control.
You can't control the game they're going to play.
You can't control how good they are.
You can't control how strong they are.
Don't think about it.
What can you control?
You can control how hard you practice.
You can control your strategy going into the game.
If you have any sense at all, you're going to take your time, your energy, focusing on
the things you can control and you're going to prepare, train to the best of your ability.
You're going to go in with the best game strategy you can think of.
You know what?
If that doesn't do it, what else could?
Nothing could.
If that doesn't win you the game, then winning the game just wasn't in the cards.
But it's certainly possible for you to lose a game that you could have won if you allow
yourself to be distracted by the things you have no control over.
It's a waste of time.
It's a waste of energy.
The Stoics would go on to point out that among the things you have control over, you have
very great or even absolute control over many of your own personality traits and character
traits.
For instance, to be honest, it's a choice you can make and you have it in your control,
so you should make it.
To be a caring individual is something you can decide to do.
May not come naturally to you, but you can decide to do it and it will affect your life,
the quality of your life, it will affect your relationships.
The idea though, do you have control over whether somebody becomes your friend or not?
Well, you can affect whether somebody becomes a friend or not, but you can't control it.
So the Stoics analysis, we waste so much of our time thinking or dwelling on things we
can't control and that's stupid because we can't control them.
So those are examples of their strategy.
When I look back at the advice they give and I realize it was only in the second half of
the 20th century that psychologists started thinking in these same terms and they developed
some of the same strategies as the Stoics had.
One of them is this whole notion of framing.
So in my book, The Stoic Challenge, it's about setbacks and when you experience a setback
in life, some people when they do, that's it, that's the end of the game.
They just say, oh no, I got setback so I give up, other people when setback have the ability
to bounce back and overcome the setbacks they're experiencing.
Part of the question is how you frame a setback.
If you're setback and you respond by playing the role of victim, well that's too bad.
It's going to be a personally tragic thing for you.
But when you're setback, if you instead say, well, it's not a setback, it's a challenge
and it's a challenge I'm going to do my best to rise to.
Interestingly if you look at some of the world's most successful people, you'll find that
one of the things that's true of them is the remarkable number of failures they experienced.
So success typically arises out of multiple failures and you can look at successful athletes
and you can look at successful business people, this seems to be true.
It's the case that they were setback on what made the difference, they bounced.
They found a workaround or they just said, hey, I failed, let's see, what can I learn
from that failure because I'm going to take a new approach, different approach where I
might make new mistakes but I'm not going to make that same mistake again and it turns
out that that approach to life can have a huge impact on where you end up in life.
I totally agree.
The example that you used for the athletes immediately reminded me of sumo and sumo wrestling.
I love sumo and I'm following it and beside watching it as a beautiful sport, a part of
it has always for me has always been how these guys are focused on their match that day and
when you're talking to them that, okay, what happened?
They're talking about, okay, this is what happened and are you thinking about championship
and every single time they're saying, I'm just focused on my next match and I'm focused
on doing the best sumo that I can do.
If your best isn't good enough, you do not need to regret, you do not need to apologize,
you did your best but of course most people fall short of doing their best because they
fear failure and this notion of you don't go out of your way to fail but you realize
that if you're doing something hard, failure is a possibility.
It's maybe even a likelihood if you're doing something really hard.
The stoics went out of their way to do hard things just because they were hard and for
them, the idea that resilience didn't necessarily just come naturally, that it's something
you could develop and the way to develop it was to experience difficult, unpleasant, uncomfortable
situations and then deal with the setbacks those situations presented.
You walk away a stronger human being, somebody who is more self-confident, somebody who has
the ability to bounce instead of break when life presents them with a setback.
And I'm glad that we started this conversation with you saying that you became in stoic after
40, that you got into Zen and stoicism after 40 so it's not like people have to get into
it early in their life otherwise they're going to miss out on understanding a point of it
or anything like that.
At any point, I would imagine it doesn't matter what age you are, it's just a matter of perspective
and the will.
Is that right?
Yeah, I agree with that entirely.
I had assumed that stoicism worked best for older people but I have subsequently found
that that is very much a mistake.
I think you have to have experienced some challenges in life in order to really appreciate
what stoicism has to offer but there are people challenged at any ages you can name.
So sure, young and old alike and the strategies again work at all ages.
Adolescence has its own challenges and they're really tough challenges if you think back
of how hard it was to be a teenager.
So maybe they're a ripe audience for this but first of all they have to know that it
exists and they have to want to put it to work in their life.
What are some of the resources you would recommend for stoicism aside from your books?
Well, let's see, I've read a lot of psychology and so there are modern behavioral psychologists
who have looked into the same things that the stoics were talking about.
So somebody who was interested primarily in the psychology that lies behind the strategies
could look at, let's see, there's the book Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman.
It's a wonderful book and what he's done is very carefully through careful psychological
experimentation.
And his colleague whose name I'm blanking on right now did experiments in which they
tested out a number of psychological strategies in order to see the tricks the human mind
plays on us and more importantly the way to avoid those tricks.
So that's a useful thing to read.
The stoics themselves, even though they're philosophers, a lot of philosophy is simply
very difficult for a non-philosopher to read but that's not true of the stoics.
Marcus Aurelius, his Meditations, it's just his notebook, wasn't intended for publication,
just a notebook of observations about what he sees in life and how people can deal with
the challenges life presents.
So he has a lot of fans, he's got to be the best selling of the stoics.
And there's books, Massimo Pugliese's How to Be a Stoic is a wonderful book.
And in each of the books I've written I have a section of recommended reading so they can
check that as well.
Excellent.
Bill's new book is called The Stoic Challenge of Philosopher's Guide to Becoming Tougher,
Calmer and More Resilient.
You mentioned that next you're going to do a study about how to have conversations.
What is next for you aside from that and where can people follow your work?
Let's see.
I have a website, williambervin.com.
You're not on Twitter though, right?
I couldn't find your Twitter.
No, I'm a geezer.
And I'm realizing more than ever how my world has changed.
The first book that I published would have been in the early 2000s and it was a physical
paper manuscript and I would send it back and forth to the editor and it would be this
huge box, paper three inches thick and there would be this time lag between when you did
it and when you came back.
Now, it's all electronic and the book I'm currently working on, I'm making a goal that
there will be no paper that I consume in the production of the book so it's just all on
word processor.
But the other thing I'm realizing is it used to be that in order to successfully sell a
book, you needed to get book reviews and the book reviews to a considerable extent have
become secondary.
Now a sensible author, I'm not a sensible author but if I were, I'd be working social
media and I'd have a Facebook page and I would be Twittering and I would be doing all of
this other stuff and I should be but yeah, just I'm from the wrong generation apparently
which is no excuse at all.
And following me, I don't know, you know the notion of followers and again if I want
to sell books, I'm talking terrible but the notion of followers, well if you want to follow
me, read what I've written and that's the best of me that there is because I spend a
lot of time carefully choosing words and putting them down for the world to consume but yeah,
there are people who are followed on a daily basis by vast numbers of people which is one
of these social phenomena that I don't really understand but I'm an outlier so I'm to blame.
I realize that that's just an issue I have but certainly one of the things they can do
if they want to dip a toe into Stoicism, so on the Stoic website, WilliamBIrvin.com, I
have a whole bunch of Stoic essays that I've written and these are typically like 900 word
things that are available for free and you can take a look at them and it's practical
advice of Stoicism in your daily life, what sorts of things can it do for you and so that
would be an interesting way for them to dip in a toe and see if they like the water.
Excellent.
It certainly has been a pleasure talking to you.
Let me ask you the last question that I ask all my guests that if you come across an intelligent
alien from a different civilization, what would you say the greatest thing that we have
done as humanity and what would you say is our worst achievement?
Worst achievement is our inhumanity to each other which expresses itself routinely and
you take almost any culture, it's interesting to try to find exceptions to this and there
have been these periods of time when a bunch of people in the same place have gone crazy.
Let's say Germany, oh yeah, there was that World War I thing and that World War II thing.
What about France?
Oh yeah, the French Revolution where people were being beheaded.
What about Rwanda?
Oh yeah, there was that little incident when neighbors started killing neighbors and about
what a third of the population died.
What about the United States?
Well, there was slavery, there was the witchcraft thing going on and you realize what a share
shallow fragile thing human culture is, how it's possible for people to live side by
side in harmony and then just start killing each other and then the sad thing is, could
it happen again?
Could it happen here in America where I am?
The answer is yes and if we think we're special and different, the answer is no because we
deep down are human beings.
That's the great human tragedy.
On the positive side, we've done some magnificent things as far as helping people is concerned.
We have raised the level of prosperity and this is a mixed blessing of course, but you
think back, where were we 50,000 years ago or 70,000?
We were in the savannas of Africa and look at how far we've come and look at the artistic
productions and the scientific productions.
We are capable, we are gods, we are monsters and we just switch identities with the passage
of time apparently, so bittersweet.
It's a bittersweet state of affairs.
