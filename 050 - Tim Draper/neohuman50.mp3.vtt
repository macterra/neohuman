00:00.000 --> 00:05.840
You know, I'm no longer a Republican or a Democrat. I was both. I was once a Republican,

00:05.840 --> 00:12.960
and then I was a Democrat. I'm a declined estate because both parties are building the

00:13.760 --> 00:21.360
duopoly that we suffer under. We need a major change in government now.

00:21.360 --> 00:34.320
Hello, and welcome to the 50th episode of Neo Human Podcasts. I'm Agabahari,

00:34.320 --> 00:40.000
an agologist on Twitter and Instagram, and you can follow the show on liveinlimbo.com,

00:40.000 --> 00:46.240
iTunes, and YouTube. And with me today, I have Tim Draper. Welcome to Neo Human Podcast, Tim.

00:46.240 --> 00:48.720
Terrific. My pleasure. Good to be here.

00:48.720 --> 00:52.080
It's great to have you. Let's start with your background, the work you've done,

00:52.080 --> 00:54.560
and what are you mainly focused on now these days?

00:54.560 --> 00:59.120
So my background, how far back do you want to go? I'm six.

01:00.400 --> 01:03.360
As far as you feel comfortable going back to?

01:03.360 --> 01:09.760
Well, okay. I was a Stanford electrical engineer and then Harvard MBA, and then I

01:09.760 --> 01:19.360
started Draper Associates, a venture fund, and I spun out an SBIC, a small business investment

01:19.360 --> 01:28.560
company that my father had started, and I borrowed $6 million against that from the government,

01:28.560 --> 01:33.200
and that was the $6 million I was able to start the venture business with.

01:33.200 --> 01:39.040
And so then it looked after three years like all the loans were being called, and it was going to

01:39.040 --> 01:49.200
be very scary and dangerous, and I flew back to the SBA and convinced them that things were

01:49.200 --> 01:56.640
just about around the corner. It was going to be okay, and they somehow went along with it.

01:56.640 --> 02:07.840
And so after that, in 1991, we had a whole bunch of IPOs. The window opened up, and one of those

02:07.840 --> 02:17.280
companies was Parametric Technology, and it made me and my investors about 175 times on the money,

02:17.920 --> 02:24.640
and we were able to pay back all the loans to whatever. I suddenly went to the SBA,

02:24.640 --> 02:30.160
you know, whatever. I suddenly went from being on the SBA's dirt list to their

02:33.600 --> 02:37.760
on their wall as the venture capitalist of the year.

02:37.760 --> 02:40.800
Nice. And how long did that take from zero to that point?

02:40.800 --> 02:45.200
From zero to that point was five or six years, and then I brought on

02:46.800 --> 02:52.240
John Fisher, and then later on, another three years later, I brought in Steve Jurvetson,

02:52.240 --> 03:05.040
and we built a very successful venture firm that had moments where it was the top venture

03:05.600 --> 03:12.240
firm in the world. A lot of that had to do with the fact that we were willing to venture

03:12.240 --> 03:19.600
outside of the Silicon Valley, and we were able to, we backed Skype and Baidu outside the Silicon

03:19.600 --> 03:32.560
Valley. And then about six years ago, I started to go solo and started to invest my own money

03:33.280 --> 03:47.360
alongside investors' money, and when I did that, I set up a whole new ecosystem for entrepreneurship.

03:47.360 --> 03:52.080
I built Draper University, which is attracting entrepreneurs from all over to learn

03:53.360 --> 04:00.080
how to become heroes, and I started Hero City, which is an incubator that allows

04:03.120 --> 04:09.440
entrepreneurs of all types to come in and just hang out for a while, and so we kind of created

04:09.440 --> 04:17.840
this great system where deals come from all over the world, and they come into our office, and we

04:17.840 --> 04:23.520
take a look at them, figure out if there's something we want to find. It's been very exciting, and

04:25.360 --> 04:35.680
since some of our best success came from international companies, we have a, I built

04:35.680 --> 04:42.560
the Draper Venture Network, and there are a series of, I think we've got something like 30 venture

04:42.560 --> 04:50.640
funds from around the world that are part of the network, and that also gives us a great flavor

04:50.640 --> 04:57.680
for what's going on in other parts of the world, and it's great. And then I got really early

04:57.680 --> 05:07.760
involved in Bitcoin and lost them all to Mt. Gox, and then realized that Mt. Gox didn't make Bitcoin

05:07.760 --> 05:17.040
go away, so I figured people really needed it, and so that's why I bid high and won the auction

05:18.000 --> 05:25.600
for Bitcoin when the U.S. Marshal's Office auctioned off the Silk Road Bitcoin. And since then,

05:25.600 --> 05:32.640
we've been sort of the center of all that activity in crypto, so that anybody who's starting an

05:32.640 --> 05:41.440
ICO or a cryptocurrency or a blockchain company, they know they can come to us as sort of a good

05:41.440 --> 05:49.680
first stop. So this has been a very exciting career, and I'm loving it.

05:49.680 --> 05:55.520
Loving it. So you've been, everything that you've done had something to do with technology. How has

05:55.520 --> 06:01.840
the growth of technology helped you with the evolution of your perspective towards the world

06:01.840 --> 06:08.240
as an investor and an individual? Yeah, so it's really interesting to see when I'm a

06:09.360 --> 06:16.640
as a venture capital investor, I'm always looking for where there's an industry that is providing

06:16.640 --> 06:22.960
bad service at a high cost, because those are the industries that are usually monopolies or

06:22.960 --> 06:31.520
oligopolies, and when there's a new technology that comes along, it usually gives an entrepreneur

06:31.520 --> 06:39.920
an opportunity to wedge into that industry. So the internet came along, and it transformed

06:39.920 --> 06:49.600
music and entertainment and communications and information and taxis. All those industries got

06:49.600 --> 06:55.840
completely transformed because the internet was there, and it was this new technology that allowed

06:57.040 --> 07:07.120
in effect, allowed products to spread and information to travel. Well, now, with the

07:07.120 --> 07:15.360
advent of Bitcoin, now we have another one of those, and a new technology, and that technology

07:15.920 --> 07:23.840
is allowing money to travel much more frictionlessly. And it also, when combined with

07:23.840 --> 07:31.280
with all this new data technology and artificial intelligence, has the ability to transform a bunch

07:31.280 --> 07:38.160
of other industries that weren't really that much affected by the internet coming. Banking industry,

07:38.160 --> 07:45.520
real estate, insurance, health care. Health care is going to change in a big way. It's going to be

07:45.520 --> 07:52.720
very data driven. And government itself, I think, needs some transformation. That's the monopoly

07:52.720 --> 07:59.200
that provides the worst service at the highest cost. And it really is the worst service at the

07:59.200 --> 08:05.360
highest cost. It really is the worst kind of monopoly, right? Yeah, it's the kind of monopoly

08:06.240 --> 08:13.120
you think you're stuck with. But it turns out now, government has two layers. They have the

08:13.120 --> 08:21.280
physical layer that is like, you've got to go to the government to see what kind of a building

08:21.280 --> 08:27.680
you're going to build or what services you're going to provide in that building. But then,

08:27.680 --> 08:31.920
there are all these things that can be done virtually, like your pension or

08:32.640 --> 08:39.440
some sort of a welfare state or health care insurance or social security. All of these

08:39.440 --> 08:46.160
can be done at the virtual level. So the geographic borders are no longer important here,

08:46.720 --> 08:53.040
because there's no reason I couldn't get my social security from Chile and my medical

08:53.040 --> 09:01.280
insurance from Canada and maybe a pension from a country that hasn't even been invented yet

09:01.280 --> 09:11.840
and doesn't even have a landmass. So there could be a whole new series of ways people manage

09:11.840 --> 09:19.520
themselves and govern themselves that's coming that isn't tied to the fiefdom that we've

09:19.520 --> 09:29.120
operated under for all these many centuries. So suddenly, you've got finance, enormous industries,

09:29.120 --> 09:36.160
trillion-dollar industries being transformed, financing. Venture capital is being transformed.

09:36.160 --> 09:44.000
In Q3 of last year, there was more money raised in ICOs than there was in venture capital. So our

09:44.000 --> 09:50.720
own industry is getting a transformation. And I'm embracing it. A lot of people kind of ran

09:50.720 --> 09:55.920
and hid in their shells, but I'm embracing it pretty excited about it.

09:55.920 --> 10:01.360
Well, you're embracing it both in business and politics, right? Because I want to ask you about

10:01.360 --> 10:08.400
the CAL 3 proposal. And as far as I understand, blockchain governance was one of the ideas,

10:08.400 --> 10:13.040
if not the principal ideas, that you had in mind for the three states to run themselves

10:13.040 --> 10:23.520
independently, right? Yeah. It was a part of it. Government in California has been pretty much

10:23.520 --> 10:32.960
stagnant for 50 years. Meanwhile, communications and information and all sorts of software

10:32.960 --> 10:39.760
entertainment, they're improving according to Moore's law. They're improving like $1,000

10:39.760 --> 10:46.800
worth of compute power doubles every 18 months. So they're doubling in value every 18 months,

10:46.800 --> 10:54.640
but our government services have been stagnant, even decreased in value over that same period

10:54.640 --> 11:00.400
of time. So this is sort of an interesting opportunity. There's a new technology that can

11:00.400 --> 11:07.040
actually improve government services. And I thought three Californias would be an opportunity for

11:07.040 --> 11:15.600
the worst state, the worst government. It's a great state to live in, but although they say

11:15.600 --> 11:20.320
quality of life, we're the worst quality of life. So we're the worst government. It provides the

11:20.320 --> 11:28.000
worst service at the highest cost. Education's gone from first to 47th. We are now 50th as a

11:28.000 --> 11:37.360
place to do business. We're 50th in quality of life because people can't afford the housing and

11:37.360 --> 11:43.600
the schools are bad and all that. And so I was looking and I was saying, well, this is an

11:43.600 --> 11:52.960
opportunity to create three new states that were fresh and kind of reboot the governance of this

11:52.960 --> 12:03.040
landmass. And what a great opportunity with the blockchain and Bitcoin available. All of these

12:03.040 --> 12:10.240
smart contracts and artificial intelligence and big data, all of them could easily replace

12:11.040 --> 12:19.840
the bureaucrats we have in place in California. And those bureaucrats can go find better things

12:19.840 --> 12:31.520
to do and we can be better managed or better governed through the cloud. And that is something

12:31.520 --> 12:39.200
that the Bunions, the bureaucratic unions, don't like because they were going to lose their people.

12:39.200 --> 12:45.280
And so they did everything they could to thwart me. First with six Californias, they made it so

12:45.280 --> 12:54.160
that the signature counters discounted the number of signatures that I had enough so that it wouldn't

12:54.160 --> 13:03.760
qualify. And then this time, they did it by, we qualified because we got twice as many signatures

13:03.760 --> 13:07.760
as we needed. So there was no way they could say they were no good.

13:07.760 --> 13:10.960
How many signatures did they get? Like 800,000, something like that?

13:10.960 --> 13:21.600
Yeah, we got 650,000 the second. And we needed 300 and something thousand. And so we got all these

13:21.600 --> 13:28.480
signatures and the Secretary of State's office said, okay, and so we were proposition nine.

13:29.280 --> 13:37.840
And so the Bunions set up a shill non-profit corporation to sue us and make it so that the

13:37.840 --> 13:52.080
California Supreme Court judges would have to vote on it just before they were about to print

13:52.080 --> 14:01.280
the ballots. And so that they wouldn't have to print them twice. They just yanked it off the

14:01.280 --> 14:07.840
ballot arbitrarily. That's crazy. And so you don't get to vote on it. I don't get to vote on it.

14:07.840 --> 14:14.800
The only people that got to vote on it were the six Supreme Court justices. So they basically yanked

14:16.160 --> 14:26.160
democracy away from us. And so it is going to be a challenge because these people,

14:26.160 --> 14:31.520
don't want to lose their jobs. They're very concerned about losing their jobs. But their

14:31.520 --> 14:39.680
jobs and their lives are going to be so much better if we have, you know, when you can use

14:39.680 --> 14:45.840
artificial intelligence, you should use artificial intelligence. And it makes you kind of move beyond

14:45.840 --> 14:54.320
it. I mean, if I can have, you know, a car drive me, and I can drive a car, and I can drive a car,

14:54.320 --> 15:01.040
you know, a car drive me without a driver in it, terrific. That's even better than having the

15:01.040 --> 15:05.840
driver have to drive around. Driver can drive around on their own if they like. But they've

15:05.840 --> 15:11.200
got the freedom. And they've been freed up into the economy. And they can do other things. They can

15:11.200 --> 15:25.760
go help us get off the planet or go to help us. They can grow the economy, they can spend money,

15:25.760 --> 15:33.280
they can earn money, they can do lots of different things. So this is, I think people

15:33.280 --> 15:42.160
didn't understand it at first. It was interesting. Our polling went from 8% to 12% to 17% to 27%,

15:43.120 --> 15:53.120
with 35% undecided. And I think that's what the Bunyan saw. They saw that this was a very real

15:53.120 --> 16:02.320
possibility. And so that made them very nervous. And that's why they sued and got the poll.

16:02.320 --> 16:08.400
They got the Supreme Court to yank it off the ballot. It was unprecedented. No one has ever,

16:10.160 --> 16:15.360
the Supreme Court has never done that before the vote. It's like un-American.

16:15.920 --> 16:20.240
Yeah, and definitely not democratic, right? So that's out of window right there.

16:20.240 --> 16:28.160
No, the whole point of it, democracy, is that the people help run, the government works for the

16:28.160 --> 16:33.600
people, not the other way around. And somehow it's, you know, here the people said,

16:33.600 --> 16:37.600
we want to vote. And the government said, we're not going to let you.

16:38.720 --> 16:44.480
Now, Elon Musk was on Joe Rogan's podcast. I don't know if you listened to it. Very interesting.

16:45.120 --> 16:50.320
And he was talking about how he became a fatalist with respect to artificial intelligence,

16:50.320 --> 16:56.640
because he tried to warn people of the dangers of not adapting as fast as we should, you know,

16:56.640 --> 17:00.240
including people in the Congress. And nobody really cared about what he was saying. That's

17:00.240 --> 17:06.000
basically what he was saying. So I'm a fatalist now, just to basically keep my own sanity.

17:06.000 --> 17:11.360
Do you think the government of the United States qualified to address any of these issues? You know,

17:11.360 --> 17:18.480
we've seen some of the tech CEOs testifying in Senate and Congress hearings. And how do you

17:18.480 --> 17:23.200
think government is doing compared to all the advancement and developments that have been

17:23.200 --> 17:31.360
happening? It's interesting, because a lot of these governments are run by very elderly people

17:31.360 --> 17:38.800
who have had very full lives, so that their judgment should generally be better. But they

17:38.800 --> 17:47.600
are not early adopters of technology. And so here, here's sort of an example. Let's say there's a

17:47.600 --> 17:57.280
23 year old, and he's just coming out of college, and he's $200,000 in debt. And, and this is

17:57.280 --> 18:03.440
typical, they've gone to college, and then they've had long big loans, and they're deeply in debt.

18:03.440 --> 18:08.720
And there's no real way for them to get out of debt, other than to just sort of pay it off over

18:08.720 --> 18:14.240
a very, very long time. And then all of a sudden, there's this new currency that comes along,

18:14.240 --> 18:25.920
Bitcoin, and, and this new currency is, is suddenly available, and, and spreading and growing and

18:26.320 --> 18:35.440
value and exciting and frictionless and decentralized, not tied to some grandpa's fiefdom.

18:36.400 --> 18:42.000
And they were saying, you know, well, grandpa set this thing up so that I was 200,000 bucks in debt,

18:42.000 --> 18:50.000
and I was educated in a way that really wasn't very valuable to me. And all of a sudden, now,

18:50.720 --> 18:58.480
there's this interesting opportunity for me. And I think that's what's going on. And now you've got

18:58.480 --> 19:06.800
the grandfathers trying to figure out how to regulate the grandchildren who are coming out

19:06.800 --> 19:12.720
with all these great ideas for new ways of tokenizing things and building things. To the

19:12.720 --> 19:20.480
grandfathers, this is, they might as well speaking, been speaking in Martian. They're, they don't,

19:20.480 --> 19:26.160
they don't understand what's going on. They don't like the idea of a change because, hey, let's face

19:26.160 --> 19:31.520
it, they've built up a whole stack of dollars. And they they're thinking, wait, wait, my dollars

19:31.520 --> 19:36.560
may not be worth as much because there's this new currency that's better frictionless. And

19:36.560 --> 19:46.640
less decentralized, not tied to any, you know, frivolous political source. This is a big change.

19:46.640 --> 19:55.680
This is a sea change. And, and it's generational. You know, if I go to, if I go to somebody,

19:55.680 --> 20:01.520
typical person about my age, who says, and I say, Hey,

20:01.520 --> 20:10.080
can I pay in Bitcoin? They say, they said, absolutely not. I need dollars. And if you go

20:10.080 --> 20:15.440
to somebody who's about 30 years old, you say, Hey, can I pay in Bitcoin? They said, yeah,

20:15.440 --> 20:23.200
I'll do it for you. Even if you do it in line at Starbucks, you can say to the barista, hey,

20:23.200 --> 20:27.600
can I pay in Bitcoin? And if that guy says, sorry, God, they don't have it here yet. The

20:27.600 --> 20:36.320
guy behind you in line says, I'll take your Bitcoin and I'll pay in fiat. And so, so I think the,

20:36.320 --> 20:41.840
the younger group, the up and comers, the ones who are going to kind of make the future

20:42.880 --> 20:49.040
are loving this new technology, they're loving the new currency, they're loving all of that great,

20:49.760 --> 20:56.000
all the great things that could potentially happen with it. And the old people, they're

20:56.000 --> 21:05.520
loving it. And the older generation who are kind of running the old monopolistic system, are

21:06.880 --> 21:12.880
either threatened by it or curious to it. It's interesting, you know, in China,

21:14.880 --> 21:24.480
that guy, the guy who's declared himself king is, is afraid of all of this, right? He lives in,

21:24.480 --> 21:32.960
in fear and, and any loathes, fear and loathing, fears and loathes, the idea of some other currency

21:32.960 --> 21:42.400
that he doesn't control. The SEC in the US is somewhere in between where they're kind of going,

21:42.400 --> 21:49.840
well, we know we need to protect the widows, but we don't want to give up all this great technology

21:49.840 --> 21:56.240
that's going to come out of this. And so they, they're trying to balance it. And in, in Tokyo,

21:56.240 --> 22:03.440
in Japan, Japanese said, Bitcoin's a national currency, here's how you do an ICO, come to our

22:03.440 --> 22:11.280
country. And, and you're seeing that in a lot of smaller countries, Malta, Gibraltar, Singapore,

22:11.280 --> 22:17.760
Estonia, where they're opening up and saying, hey, come to our country. We are open to this new

22:17.760 --> 22:25.760
currency. We're open to this new way of life. And we're not, we're not obsessed with our own

22:25.760 --> 22:32.320
currency. And we do understand that our own currency is subject to political whims. And

22:32.320 --> 22:40.560
that this new currency is more liquid and more transparent and more open. And I can take my

22:40.560 --> 22:48.000
Bitcoin anywhere. I mean, I can go anywhere. I can pull down my Bitcoin. And all of these other

22:48.000 --> 22:55.280
currencies around the world are kind of limited to some geographical area. Are you in favor of a

22:55.280 --> 23:00.000
total free market model for cryptocurrencies or wouldn't or wouldn't mind some regulations and

23:00.000 --> 23:04.480
oversight overall, because that's the problem that government has with them, right? That they can be

23:04.480 --> 23:09.840
used for terrorism and all the other negative things that they claim. Well, actually, the,

23:09.840 --> 23:18.800
the most dangerous currency is, is the paper dollar. That's the one that can't be tracked.

23:18.800 --> 23:25.280
The Bitcoin is completely trackable. In fact, the US Marshals Office has been catching

23:26.080 --> 23:31.760
all of these criminals who were trying to use Bitcoin to do nefarious things, because the

23:31.760 --> 23:42.480
blockchain is, is secure. And if somebody, now if somebody gets Bitcoin, they're not caught then.

23:43.120 --> 23:47.760
But, but what happens then is the Marshall's Office says, Oh, well, that's, that's where the

23:47.760 --> 23:55.760
bitcoins being held. Soon as it moves, we move in. And, and so as soon as people who are nefarious,

23:55.760 --> 24:03.360
try to spend their Bitcoin, they're caught. That's not true with, with paper money.

24:05.280 --> 24:15.760
So actually, you are much more secure as a population if you are using Bitcoin. And in fact,

24:16.880 --> 24:23.520
the banks are getting hacked at every day. All the banks are easily hacked now by plenty of

24:23.520 --> 24:30.800
software developers who come after them in lots of different ways. But the Bitcoin blockchain has

24:30.800 --> 24:36.480
never been hacked. There's been hacks around it in various currencies. But the Bitcoin blockchain

24:36.480 --> 24:43.280
has never been hacked. It is the most secure currency we have on the earth. And, and more and

24:43.280 --> 24:49.360
more miners are proving that to be the case. Every time a new miner is added, the currency

24:49.360 --> 24:56.080
becomes more secure. Do you think the argument for anonymity of a coin like Monero, for example,

24:56.080 --> 25:02.720
in contrast to traceability of Bitcoin has any kind of ground long term wise? And if so,

25:03.520 --> 25:09.760
what would stop again, an alternative community that use anonymous coins on blockchain to

25:10.560 --> 25:17.760
conduct their own business? I warn people all the time. Monero is also on a blockchain,

25:17.760 --> 25:25.840
all of those around a blockchain, you are not, you are not incognito, you act absolutely can

25:25.840 --> 25:33.520
be found out. And so I don't know why people just don't say, hey, let's open up, we're going to be

25:33.520 --> 25:41.680
transparent. Here's my Bitcoin. This is where it is. No problem. And why they're trying to use these

25:41.680 --> 25:48.400
dark places, because they're just gonna, I mean, they're gonna be caught. There's, there's no

25:48.400 --> 25:52.400
question about it. They are on a blockchain, they're going to be caught if they're doing

25:52.400 --> 26:01.440
something nefarious. So yeah, I don't buy the fact that some of them say, oh, yeah, we're the dark

26:01.440 --> 26:06.960
coin or the Monero or whatever, I don't buy it. Because no matter what, they're all going to

26:06.960 --> 26:13.920
eventually open up. So there is no true anonymous coin as of yet, or? Well, I think the criminals

26:13.920 --> 26:19.280
are trying to stay ahead of the law. Right. But I don't think they can. I mean, eventually,

26:19.280 --> 26:25.120
they all get caught. What are the most exciting developments and areas in tech for you today?

26:25.120 --> 26:29.760
We know blockchain is one of them. Well, I'll give you one kind of fun example. And that is,

26:29.760 --> 26:38.080
in healthcare, let's say, you put you control your data, okay, flip it around, right now,

26:38.080 --> 26:46.720
the hospital has all the data, you control your data, it's on the blockchain, you're using a,

26:47.440 --> 26:54.240
a using Bitcoin as a, as an insurance through the insurance program, you're paying in Bitcoin and

26:54.240 --> 27:03.760
you're, and the all your medical visits are paid in Bitcoin. And you're putting all of your

27:03.760 --> 27:11.200
information, your medical records, your, your blood test results, your genetic history, that all goes

27:11.200 --> 27:19.680
into the cloud. But not just that, your Fitbit results, what you had for breakfast, where you

27:19.680 --> 27:30.160
traveled recently, what your kind of work you've been doing, how much travel you've done, what

27:30.160 --> 27:38.960
stress you've been under all those things are put into your data. And then that data goes up into

27:38.960 --> 27:46.320
the cloud. And then you say, I've got a headache. Okay, if you say you've got a headache, it might

27:46.320 --> 27:51.920
be like, Oh, take two aspirin and call me in the morning, I say I've got a headache. They say, Oh,

27:51.920 --> 28:02.320
boy, you've been on Fire Island, you might have Lyme tick disease. And we need antibiotics. And so no

28:02.320 --> 28:11.920
doctor in the world in 12 years can memorize all of that data. And all of the, all of the little

28:11.920 --> 28:20.000
changes that would happen to people's lives, as well as people taking their information, putting

28:20.000 --> 28:24.800
it into the cloud and having the artificial intelligence of the cloud, the deep learning of

28:24.800 --> 28:33.200
the cloud, big data of the cloud, all combine and get you your diagnosis. This is going to be a

28:33.200 --> 28:41.120
magic time, people are going to be get much better, better care and your doctor, I suspect will be

28:41.120 --> 28:53.600
become more of a consultant than a than a direct dictator of what you should be doing. And, and that

28:53.600 --> 29:02.240
will be because they will have this, this advisor with them, which is the cloud. And then your data,

29:02.240 --> 29:08.800
you'll get money for selling your data into the drug companies and the hospitals and whoever else

29:08.800 --> 29:15.360
you want to sell your data into. Now, a lot of people say that any technological progress works

29:15.360 --> 29:20.560
as best as a society that adapts it. So how are we doing as a society in your opinion? Because I

29:20.560 --> 29:24.400
remember a couple of years ago, people were attacking other people who were wearing Google

29:24.400 --> 29:29.520
glasses, I think it was in San Francisco, or we're getting really pissed off at tech companies

29:29.520 --> 29:34.640
because of rise in the housing price. And they were they were blaming tech, so they should blame

29:34.640 --> 29:42.880
government there. California allows people to create startups, it allows those startups to become

29:42.880 --> 29:50.640
worth something. But then as soon as those startups want to employ people, California makes it

29:51.120 --> 30:00.480
untenable to operate here. I mean, sure, there are a few, you know, Facebook still has their headquarters

30:00.480 --> 30:09.600
here, Salesforce. But most of them, when they get big, Tesla's battery factory is a perfect example,

30:09.600 --> 30:14.320
they're going to set up a battery factory is going to employ 10s of 1000s of people. Well, they,

30:14.960 --> 30:21.440
they wanted to put it here in California, but California made it untenable. And they had to

30:21.440 --> 30:28.800
push it out so that they looked around, they went to Nevada instead. Now, what happens then?

30:28.800 --> 30:36.800
All the jobs leave California. And so who's left? The people who made a bunch of money on that,

30:37.280 --> 30:44.800
on that startup, and these people who can't get jobs because all the jobs just left. And California

30:44.800 --> 30:51.520
says, Oh, it must be the business people, and it must be the tech people, it must be the something

30:51.520 --> 30:59.200
people, it must be the something people. It's not it's the government shoving big businesses out of

30:59.200 --> 31:04.640
the state, we want the big businesses here, so that they can employ the middle class so that they

31:04.640 --> 31:11.600
can employ those people who are right now out on the street and homeless, because I am jobless,

31:11.600 --> 31:20.080
because we don't have the jobs for them. But we would have if we had made it so that

31:20.080 --> 31:26.000
put his battery factory here, or we would have if, if they hadn't pushed Sony and all of the

31:27.600 --> 31:33.360
studios out of the state, so that they go and they do their their filming somewhere else.

31:36.080 --> 31:39.680
Oh, Amazon was going to put their second headquarters somewhere else.

31:41.200 --> 31:46.640
California didn't even make the second cut. They were thinking, Yeah, well, we'll check out

31:46.640 --> 31:50.560
Sacramento when they were there for like 10 seconds, and they realized, Oh, my God,

31:51.280 --> 31:57.120
these guys are going to regulate us to death. There's no way we want to employ people here.

31:57.120 --> 32:02.160
So would you be in favor of a Republican governor for California if that person runs on the policies

32:02.160 --> 32:07.760
that are closer to what you were saying as a business ideal? You know, I'm not I'm no longer

32:07.760 --> 32:13.120
a Republican or a Democrat. I was both I was once a Republican, and then I was a Democrat. I'm a

32:13.120 --> 32:21.440
declined estate, because both parties are building the duopoly that we suffer under.

32:22.640 --> 32:31.520
We need we need a major change in government. Now, somehow, the bunions have grown to be where

32:31.520 --> 32:36.000
they're, they're so big and so powerful, we don't really have a representative government anymore,

32:36.000 --> 32:44.320
right, as proven by Cal three. So, so I don't know whether a Republican or a Democrat will make any

32:44.320 --> 32:53.760
difference. I think it has to do with a major overhaul to the system. And, and that's not going

32:53.760 --> 33:00.960
to happen unless somebody, unless the Supreme Court lets Cal three go through or, or something

33:00.960 --> 33:08.480
else. I mean, and of course, the you know, the press will beat it down for a long time before

33:08.480 --> 33:17.440
they embrace it and say, Oh, yeah, it was our idea all along. You ever watch the watch a sports game

33:17.440 --> 33:22.560
where it's sort of an underdog somehow comes and wins the game in the last minute, right?

33:23.440 --> 33:28.800
You listen to the sportscasters and they go, Oh, yeah, I knew this was gonna happen. So and so,

33:28.800 --> 33:34.480
you know, this team, the favorites gonna win and that's the way it's gonna be and blah, blah, blah,

33:34.480 --> 33:40.240
how great they all are. And then all of a sudden, the underdog comes and overthrows them and wins

33:40.240 --> 33:47.440
the game. And, and then they go, Oh, boy, that guy so and so is so great. We knew about it all along.

33:47.440 --> 33:54.320
He came from nowhere, blah, blah, blah. And, and there's no comment on like, we got it so wrong

33:54.320 --> 34:01.840
before. But right now, the press is just sort of, you know, the problem that supports what the

34:01.840 --> 34:07.520
government's doing. And, oh, we just leave it the way it is. And we'll slowly all walk off a cliff,

34:08.400 --> 34:16.080
as opposed to, hey, there are some interesting things happening here. We have a real problem.

34:16.080 --> 34:26.480
Let's wake up. But I think that's the free press is a wonderful thing here, because it is, it is

34:26.480 --> 34:33.760
so valuable to the United States. It, I mean, at least people can take shots at their president,

34:33.760 --> 34:43.600
that at least people can say what they think. I guess unless the Supreme Court of California

34:43.600 --> 34:52.560
rules against them. Yeah, that's very unfortunate. It's worse than that. It's like 250 years of a

34:52.560 --> 34:58.080
democracy that was working, and all of a sudden, they're clamping it down. But are you going to

34:58.080 --> 35:05.520
push for another, not a form of Cal 3 like model, maybe in California or even somewhere else?

35:05.520 --> 35:13.360
Well, maybe you can do that. I'm exhausted. And I got blindsided twice. Yeah, so you've had enough.

35:13.840 --> 35:19.760
Maybe one of our listeners is going to listen and say, Hey, how do we, how do we make this better?

35:20.400 --> 35:25.600
Honestly, I see the government, as I mentioned in these hearings and stuff, and you know, just the

35:25.600 --> 35:30.480
questions and the fight over, you know, it's just ridiculous. And you're like, nobody's talking

35:30.480 --> 35:33.840
about artificial intelligence. Nobody's talking about big data. Nobody's talking about big data.

35:33.840 --> 35:40.240
Nobody's talking about algorithms. They started talking about algorithms with respect to social

35:40.240 --> 35:46.400
media, when you know, but they don't really understand what's going on. I know, I wish they

35:46.400 --> 35:56.640
would. But, you know, we're, we, we bolt them in. And then we keep them in forever. I mean,

35:56.640 --> 36:02.720
there are term limits on some of them, I guess, we keep them in forever. But what's worse than,

36:02.720 --> 36:07.760
than the politicians, because the politicians actually have to compete for their jobs,

36:09.120 --> 36:16.560
or the bureaucrats, the bunions, they don't have to do anything. They can stay there forever.

36:17.600 --> 36:23.360
They look at politics like a new president, new president should be like, hey, this is awesome.

36:23.360 --> 36:27.520
We got a new president. But they look at the new president, they say, you'll be here for four years,

36:27.520 --> 36:34.400
maybe eight, we're here forever. Any policies you put in, we can sit on.

36:35.040 --> 36:37.120
Is that a deep state that Trump's talking about?

36:37.840 --> 36:46.080
I'm not sure what Trump's talking about. But when we had, there were some brilliant people that put

36:46.080 --> 36:54.480
together this jobs act. And it went through and it passed through law, the Congress passed it,

36:54.480 --> 37:02.080
the president signed it. And, and, and it was going to allow crowdfunding, it was going to allow

37:03.840 --> 37:09.040
small investors to invest in private companies, it was going to allow a whole bunch of things

37:09.040 --> 37:16.240
that were going to create a lot of jobs. The bureaucrats didn't like it. And they just sat on

37:16.240 --> 37:23.600
it forever. And then they just kept adding more and more terms. And they took all of the wings

37:23.600 --> 37:32.160
off of the law. And so now, you know, you see any crowdfundings? I mean, we did a little bit with

37:32.160 --> 37:37.760
Meet the Drapers, but, but I'm not seeing a lot of crowdfundings. Because they've just they've

37:37.760 --> 37:45.440
added so many hurdles and so much bureaucracy and so many forms to fill out. They've basically taken

37:45.440 --> 37:53.920
the wings off of that. What's the solution to go beyond them? Well, I think you've got to be able to,

37:53.920 --> 38:02.240
you know, unions were were started so people could take care of themselves and gang up if,

38:03.120 --> 38:13.040
if a boss was giving them bad, a bad shake, where it's like the the mines were bad for their health

38:13.040 --> 38:19.360
or the, you know, the factory was making them work too many hours or they couldn't get sleep,

38:20.000 --> 38:29.520
or is unsafe. And those are all good uses of a union. But right now, the Bunions have negotiated

38:29.520 --> 38:38.080
for that the public unions have negotiated for where, where we go out and we pay the bills

38:38.080 --> 38:44.480
and, and pay for our government. Well, the average government employee makes more money

38:45.520 --> 38:53.120
than the average private citizen. And they take longer vacations. And they have a shorter work

38:53.120 --> 39:02.400
week. And they have a bigger pension. And so somehow, these people who are who we have

39:02.400 --> 39:11.280
hired to go in there, are not leaving ever. And, and are not even allowing the new laws to go

39:11.280 --> 39:19.920
through. So if you want something to happen, it's got to start with a bunions. Do you see any country

39:19.920 --> 39:25.760
that is doing a good job with adapting to new form of technology in in terms of running their

39:25.760 --> 39:33.600
country? Yeah, Japan, Japan, right, right. Awesome. And Singapore, of course, for years has been

39:33.600 --> 39:40.000
awesome. And China before they got this new dictator, China before they got the new dictator,

39:40.000 --> 39:46.720
they were open, they had a free market, they were encouraging innovation, they were driving

39:46.720 --> 39:51.520
business, things were going well, people were getting employed, the quality of life had gone

39:51.520 --> 40:01.760
way up. Poverty was going way down. And, and then now they got a dictator who, who is controlling

40:01.760 --> 40:10.640
everything and, and, and the free markets are getting pulled back on. Well, and now all of

40:10.640 --> 40:24.480
these little countries, Malta and Gibraltar and Cayman and Bermuda and Singapore, Estonia,

40:24.480 --> 40:31.120
Latvia, Lithuania, all these smaller countries are looking at this as a big opportunity. And

40:31.120 --> 40:34.960
they are embracing new technologies or seeing what they can do to make it better.

40:34.960 --> 40:39.680
Yeah, something that is very interesting about Japan is that how society has adapted already to

40:39.680 --> 40:45.040
different forms of robotics and technology, you know, from anime and cartoons to those crazy

40:45.040 --> 40:51.200
vending machines and their robot guides all around shopping mall. There is no this kind of a social

40:51.200 --> 40:57.520
acceptance of robotics in the United States. Would you agree? Well, in the US, they like to

40:57.520 --> 41:08.240
sell fear in the, in the news. And so they want, they want to, there are probably equal, an equal

41:08.240 --> 41:18.800
number of stories saying how unions, I mean, how robots are going to take over the world or, or

41:18.800 --> 41:23.200
artificial intelligence is going to take all our jobs. There are probably more stories about that

41:23.200 --> 41:27.920
than all the really cool things that are going to happen because of robotics and artificial

41:27.920 --> 41:33.920
intelligence. I mean, we're working, we've got a company that makes a, makes a pizza with a robot.

41:33.920 --> 41:42.880
So cool. And a perfect pizza every time. And artificial intelligence is, is making it so that

41:43.680 --> 41:49.840
we are, by the way, we're all operating with artificial intelligence today. We just don't,

41:49.840 --> 41:55.920
we just don't recognize it as such. The spell checker, that's artificial intelligence. The,

41:57.120 --> 42:04.560
the recommendation engines from the social media, that's artificial intelligence. Those things are

42:04.560 --> 42:13.280
good. They're great. We get better recommendations. We spell better. We, all those things are just like

42:13.280 --> 42:22.880
an intelligence item that's moved, moved forward. And hey, I mean, if, if I'm able to raise, the

42:22.880 --> 42:29.760
moment I'm able to raise a fund all in Bitcoin, fund companies all in Bitcoin and have those

42:29.760 --> 42:36.640
companies pay all their employees and suppliers all in Bitcoin, that's the moment I will no longer

42:36.640 --> 42:43.760
need an accountant. So think of all those really smart people who are accountants and what all the

42:43.760 --> 42:54.960
cool things they can do are. And so I think it's just better. I think the biggest challenge so far

42:54.960 --> 43:01.920
is that what, what is going to happen to the user's data and how they can be prevented from being

43:01.920 --> 43:06.720
manipulated or, you know, I've always found the business model of Facebook being a platform that

43:06.720 --> 43:12.640
depends on users data, but then the users are not getting paid by generating data and sharing data.

43:12.640 --> 43:18.640
So that's where our, that's where our company data wall, it really has it right. They give you

43:18.640 --> 43:25.680
control of your own data. So you can figure out whether you want to use it for this ad, use it

43:25.680 --> 43:33.600
for this company, and you get paid for that. So I think that's going to be the future of data and

43:33.600 --> 43:39.920
it has to be flipped from whether the way it works now. But I think that's going to be happening.

43:40.560 --> 43:45.680
Allow me to ask you the last question that I ask all my guests. If you come across an intelligent

43:45.680 --> 43:50.800
alien from a different civilization, what would you say is the worst thing humanity has done and

43:50.800 --> 44:02.240
what would you say is our greatest achievement? The worst thing is clearly wars. I think the

44:02.240 --> 44:21.680
greatest achievement is yet to come.
