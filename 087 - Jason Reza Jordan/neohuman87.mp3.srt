1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
The worst thing that can happen is the Chinese take the lead in genetic engineering.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,500
They take the lead in nanotech and AI development.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,880
And the way in which they roll out these technologies, which have the potential to fundamentally

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:18,160
alter the parameters of human existence, are ways that are going to lead to the degradation

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,200
of human individuality, to the degeneration of the potential for genius and innovative

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,440
creative thought.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:33,240
I can well imagine the Chinese using gene editing to recalibrate the human being into

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:40,080
something more, quote unquote, cooperative, into a more cooperative citizen, which also

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,440
by the same token is less capable of independent innovative thought.

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:53,760
And that would be an utter catastrophe.

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,880
Jason Reza-Giorgiani, PhD, welcome to the 87th episode of Neo Human Podcast, sir.

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,320
It's a pleasure to be with you, Aga.

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,520
Yeah, I'm looking forward to this conversation.

14
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:12,560
And kudos and shout out to Julia Prisco, who recommended your book, which I really want

15
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:20,640
to talk about the book called Prometheism, which is the beginning of a movement, I believe,

16
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,920
called the Prometheus Movement, right?

17
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah, it's a synthesis of the words Prometheus and theism, Prometheism.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Excellent.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,800
So, I mainly want to talk about that, but I also want to talk about politics and Iran.

20
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,320
And let's see where the conversation leads us.

21
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,320
Absolutely.

22
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,320
Shoot.

23
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,440
Yeah, let's start with your background, though, just so we have some kind of a context that

24
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,440
where your thoughts are coming from, you know, the work you've done, the lives you've lived

25
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,520
and what are you mainly focused on now these days?

26
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:56,160
Well, I did my master's at NYU and my master's, first of all, I'm born and raised in New York

27
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,160
City.

28
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:03,440
So, I'm a lifelong native New Yorker and I'm of Persian paternal descent.

29
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:10,920
And my mother is an American of many generations who ultimately hails from Northern European

30
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:17,780
background, a lot of Celtic and a lot of Nordic blood in her background.

31
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,160
But her family has been in America for many generations.

32
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,920
In fact, they've been New Yorkers as well for a couple of generations.

33
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,840
So, that's my family background.

34
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,200
And you know, I went to school here in New York.

35
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:39,280
I did an MA thesis on universal human rights and the problem of Islamic democracy at NYU.

36
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,560
And there I was analyzing the philosophical foundations of the UDHR, the UN Universal

37
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:52,160
Declaration of Human Rights, and showing how it's internally contradictory because its

38
00:02:52,160 --> 00:03:04,160
provision for an unqualified freedom of religion allows so-called Islamic democracies to undermine

39
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,200
the human rights of minorities who are dissenting within that society.

40
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,480
And so, I was trying to expose this loophole in the UDHR, going back even into the drafting

41
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,280
debates in Paris and in San Francisco that produced the Universal Declaration and showing

42
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,160
how there were representatives from various countries, oddly enough, including the Soviet

43
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,040
Union, who understood that this was a serious problem that would undermine the coherence

44
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,560
of the declaration.

45
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:40,000
And they wanted a very carefully worded, qualified freedom of religion that would protect universal

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,880
human rights from some, how could I put it, disingenuous attempt to use freedom of religion

47
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:55,660
to then institute something like Sharia law and divest citizens of their other basic rights

48
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,520
like the equality of women or freedom of conscience, freedom of expression, freedom of the press,

49
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,520
so on and so forth.

50
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,160
So, that was my MA thesis work.

51
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:09,920
And then I did a PhD at the State University of New York on philosophy of science and technology.

52
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:17,920
And there, I was looking at the empirical evidence from basically a century of research

53
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:26,140
in parapsychology to argue in favor of something like Heidegger's thesis about the ontological

54
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:31,960
priority of technology over science, that when you look at an existential level, when

55
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,960
you look at technology and science, you see that people usually have the relationship

56
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:42,960
between them backwards, that technology is not applied theoretical science.

57
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,200
Technological innovation is not an application of what is understood through some kind of

58
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,160
putatively pure theoretical scientific research.

59
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,120
Actually, theoretical science is grounded on technology.

60
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:03,040
And in fact, the human existence itself emerges from out of our pre-human hominid relationship

61
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,000
with technology.

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,480
So technology is the more existentially primary phenomenon.

63
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,560
And I used the evidence from parapsychology to argue that and to argue against overly

64
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,680
reductive materialistic paradigms in science.

65
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,760
And then the upshot of my doctoral dissertation, which developed into my book, Prometheus and

66
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,560
Atlas, from out of which I developed the core thesis of my book, Prometheus and Atlas, was

67
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:34,040
that Heidegger was right to suggest that technology has, I suppose, what you would call a spiritual

68
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:41,000
essence, that there is a spirit of technology, a motivating spirit or genius, a spectral

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,120
essence of technology.

70
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,440
And I argued that that spectral essence of technology is Promethean in nature.

71
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:57,960
So on the other side of the exhaustion and implosion of these reductive materialist models

72
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,000
in science is a potential rediscovery of the Promethean spirit that was the wellspring

73
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,480
of technoscientific innovation from the start, particularly in Western civilization, but

74
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,920
in the Indo-European world at large, really.

75
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,040
Very interesting.

76
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,560
The relationship between science and technology, the way that you described it, reminded me

77
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,960
of how we are using mathematics to figure out how the universe works, but it doesn't

78
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,840
mean that the universe works according to mathematics, it's just that we have a tool

79
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:32,040
that we can discover this unknown that we might end up having many other tools other

80
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:38,240
than mathematics, but this is something that reveals something that has been there for

81
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,040
perhaps much longer that we can't even comprehend.

82
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,040
Indeed.

83
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,360
And in my beginning in my doctoral work and then very substantively in Prometheus and

84
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:54,920
Atlas, I look at the deep structure of mathematical thought and connect it to the archetype of

85
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:02,240
Prometheus, because Prometheus' very name means forethought, and the Greek term from

86
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,760
which we get mathematics, mathesis, is in the name of Prometheus.

87
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:15,440
That's the methane in Prometheus, and so mathematics is really about casting a net

88
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:25,080
over the world, a net of abstraction that allows you to understand something about things

89
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,560
that you haven't even researched yet.

90
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,280
So it is a kind of projective anticipation.

91
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,160
Mathematics is ultimately not about number crunching.

92
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:42,060
At its deepest level, what it is is a mentality that allows you to capture phenomena within

93
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:48,760
a grid and then project forward from what's happening to what will happen in the future.

94
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:56,480
It's an anticipatory resoluteness that grasps the world in a very abstract fashion.

95
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:03,040
And that's really an expression of the human will to gain mastery and dominance over nature

96
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,740
with a view to securing the conditions for human flourishing.

97
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:11,800
And I don't think it's an accident that that mentality came from out of the Caucasian world.

98
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,960
I say the Caucasian world not to limit it to Europe, but also to include Iran, because

99
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,480
really the first instance of this kind of mathematical mentality in its essence is with

100
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,480
Zoroastrianism.

101
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,400
It's really in Zarathustra that you see this kind of future-oriented mentality in the first

102
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
place.

103
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,520
And it's also not coincidental that the other great bastion of technological science in

104
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,680
the world besides Europe was Iran in the medieval period, in what was the European medieval

105
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,680
period.

106
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,480
And so in the Caucasian world at large, whether it's Europe or whether it's Iran, I don't

107
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,240
think it's an accident that that was the cradle from out of which this mathematical mentality

108
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,960
developed, because it's a part of the world where you have very adverse climate conditions,

109
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:57,160
you have extreme seasonal weather, and people had to learn how to prepare for long cold

110
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,440
winters.

111
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:05,840
And so this goes again back to the forethought that's characteristic of Prometheus.

112
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:14,000
Before we move any further, you were the co-founder, I was reading, of Alt-Right Corporation.

113
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Is that right?

114
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That's correct.

115
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,840
Okay, so this term Alt-Right, we never understood what exactly it means, because the moment

116
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,400
anybody brought it up, everybody said, oh, shut up, you're Nazi, racist, but you're very

117
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:30,280
familiar, I'm sure, with all of these labels that have been given to me as well, that I'm

118
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:35,320
a Middle Eastern, former refugee, current immigrant, and somehow I'm a bigot and a racist

119
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,360
and an Islamophobe and all those things, just to dare questioning these things.

120
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,640
So let's define this term Alt-Right and then talk a little about Alt-Right Corporation

121
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:50,320
and how any of that interject into your perspective and philosophical worldview.

122
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,560
Yeah, long story short, I'll give you the nutshell version of it.

123
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,600
So Alt-Right is an abbreviation of alternative right, of course.

124
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:08,560
And this term was actually coined by a Jewish intellectual, Paul Gottfried, and Richard

125
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,400
Spencer took it over from him, okay?

126
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:20,400
So Richard Spencer had been using this term Alt-Right beginning, I think, in 2014, 2015,

127
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,080
something like that, but it hadn't really caught on very much.

128
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:30,000
And there was this phenomenon in Europe which was much more significant called the new right,

129
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,920
nouvelle droite, and my book, Prometheus and Atlas, had been published by the leading

130
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,000
new right, nouvelle droite publisher, Arctos Media, in 2016.

131
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,560
Which you're the founder of, Arctos Media?

132
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,880
No, no, no, no, I became editor-in-chief of Arctos for about a year, and I'll get into

133
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,840
how that happened.

134
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,120
So alternative right is an alternative to what?

135
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:05,400
It's an alternative to the mainstream establishment so-called right wing.

136
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,320
And the mainstream establishment, and one of the reasons that it considers itself an

137
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:17,680
alternative to this is because from the Alt-Right perspective, these modes of political thought

138
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,080
are not really on the right.

139
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,200
So what are we talking about?

140
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:28,640
Conservatism, okay, so evangelicals who are inclined toward a certain kind of conservatism

141
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,960
in the United States, that's one position that's been characterized as right within

142
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,680
the establishment, you know, a large portion of Congress in the United States basically

143
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:45,360
subscribes to that political doctrine of a kind of very mainstream conservatism and one

144
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:54,160
that's inclined toward accepting the moral ideology of evangelical Christianity as the

145
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,920
basis for legislation.

146
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:02,720
Then you have libertarians, who may not be so favorably inclined toward Christianity,

147
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:09,240
but who are often characterized as on the right because of their very staunch opposition

148
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,700
to socialism, to social welfare policies, they're wanting to extremely limit the functions

149
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,840
of government and, you know, they're very strong emphasis on, let's say, the right to

150
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:24,840
bear arms and, you know, to protect your private property and your sort of domestic sphere

151
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,840
from government interference by any and all means necessary.

152
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:35,520
So you have libertarians, you have conservatives who form kind of a mainstream right, and then

153
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,960
you also have the neoconservatives, the neocons, who are a third sort of branch of the mainstream

154
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:46,920
right that the alt-right was presenting itself as an alternative to.

155
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,640
And the alt-right's problem with the neocons in particular is that the neocons tend to

156
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:59,440
be advocates of, you know, perpetual worldwide military intervention.

157
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,840
So they have a program of, you know, serial regime change in various countries carried

158
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,960
out by the United States, and these regime change efforts, you know, are extremely costly

159
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:17,020
and detrimental to seeing to all kinds of domestic needs, whether it's a deterioration

160
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:22,720
of infrastructure domestically or other programs that would, you know, benefit American citizens.

161
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,360
When we waste $3 trillion in Iraq basically to remove, I mean, look, you and I are from

162
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,840
a Persian background, so I mean, we hate Saddam Hussein.

163
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:35,840
Saddam Hussein was a horrible person, okay, who was responsible for, you know, the massacre

164
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,920
of about half a million innocent Iranian civilians.

165
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,760
Be that as it may, you know, stepping back and looking at it relatively objectively,

166
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:50,840
Saddam Hussein was a secular authoritarian leader, and this $3 trillion was burned to

167
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:57,280
replace him with a Shiite theocracy on the one hand and a Sunni fundamentalist Islamic

168
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,260
state, on the other hand, okay?

169
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:07,160
So the alt-right also considered itself an alternative to this kind of pathological neocon

170
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:14,820
impulse to engage in all these regime change endeavors that are of little benefit to the

171
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,160
American people, in fact, quite likely detrimental to the United States over the long term.

172
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,060
Of course, you know, these interventions in Iraq and Syria also catalyzed the mass migration

173
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:28,400
into Europe, which has been catastrophic for Europe, mass migration of, you know, people

174
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,720
from the Middle East and North Africa into Europe, including the Libyan attempt at regime

175
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,120
change.

176
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:45,200
So the alt-right was an extremely amorphous rubric to categorize any one of a number of

177
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:50,800
right-wing positions that are alternatives to these mainstream types of the political

178
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:57,120
right, whether it's an alternative to libertarianism or to conservatism or to neoconservatism,

179
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,360
which is actually not really conservative.

180
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,480
It's like a classical liberal position, one that some people trace back to Leo Strauss.

181
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:11,840
In any case, the alt-right did not have any cohesive or coherent identity other than being

182
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:17,520
defined against these mainstream forms of quote unquote right-wing politics in the United

183
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,120
States.

184
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,800
And so it was very much up for grabs when I got involved, you know, in 2016, as Trump

185
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:33,320
was running for office, I was encouraged because my book Prometheus and Atlas did so well in

186
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,320
the Arctos community in the European Nouvelle-Droite.

187
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,620
And because I also had a following in the United States that came largely from my work

188
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,120
in parapsychology and, you know, Prometheus and Atlas being sort of very well received

189
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:52,660
by the parapsychology research community, I was encouraged to play a mediating role

190
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:59,480
in integrating three major institutions in what became the alternative right.

191
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:06,340
So Arctos Press, the leading press of the Nouvelle-Droite in Europe, Red Ice Radio

192
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:13,160
and Television, which was a program that dealt with parapsychology subjects, UFOs, you know,

193
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:19,620
all kinds of sort of fringe subject matters, but which took a hard right political turn

194
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,900
around 2015.

195
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:26,080
And I had had a relationship with, you know, Hendrik Palmgren, the head of Red Ice Radio

196
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:31,200
and Television, based on, you know, our common interest in the types of subjects covered

197
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,040
in Prometheus and Atlas.

198
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,120
So I was being published by Arctos.

199
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,560
I was involved with Red Ice and then, you know, I was encouraged, you know, to reach

200
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,800
out to Richard Spencer, whose conference, NPI conference in the fall of 2016, I attended

201
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,440
as a representative of Arctos.

202
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,040
This was in D.C.

203
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,800
Yes, this became the infamous Hale-Gate conference, you know, Hale-Trump, Hale-Victory and so

204
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,640
forth with the Roman salute, which I'm not going to make on camera right now.

205
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,520
So because we don't need a secondary defamation.

206
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:07,840
But I was encouraged to integrate these three organizations into something called the Alt-Right

207
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,720
Corporation.

208
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:18,160
And my main motivation in doing that at that moment was to make sure that this Alt-Right

209
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:25,520
did not wind up sinking into the swamp of white nationalism and the kind of, you know,

210
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:32,520
ghetto of racially narrow minded identity politics.

211
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,480
I had a vision, especially considering we were integrating a European organization with

212
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:43,880
an American organization and considering the fact that at the same time, like three months,

213
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,760
four months before I got involved with Richard Spencer and I also accepted the position as

214
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:54,440
editor in chief of Arctos, about four months before that in the late spring of 2016, I

215
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,260
had gotten involved with an organization called the Persian Renaissance Foundation, informally

216
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,120
known as the Iranian Renaissance.

217
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,360
And so my vision was to, and I laid this out in some detail in my book, World State of

218
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,320
Emergency, my second book in 2017.

219
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:16,340
My vision was to create a pan Indo-European alliance, which would have a European wing,

220
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:24,620
an American wing, and then connect to future neo-Zoroastrian or neo-Mithraic Iran and India.

221
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:29,920
And then ultimately end in, oh, go all the way through Russia as well, through Eurasia

222
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:35,400
and end in the Buddhist East with Japan being the principal representative of the Buddhist

223
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
East.

224
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:46,440
So America, Europe, Russia, Iran, India, and Japan as sort of nodes in a global Indo-European

225
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:56,400
network that would promote an alternative loosely right wing political philosophy that

226
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,340
would guide humanity through the impending technological singularity in the most constructive

227
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,340
way possible.

228
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,560
That was my vision.

229
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:09,160
But unfortunately, the people who had encouraged me to play this mediating, unifying role in

230
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:14,240
the alt-right never came through with their significant capital investment that they promised.

231
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:20,800
And so long story short, I lost control of the corporation and my associates really went

232
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:26,320
in their own direction, particularly Richard Spencer, who initially was very much on board

233
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,060
with this Indo-European vision.

234
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:32,320
But then as the funding didn't come through and as he continued to be caricatured in the

235
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,600
mainstream media as this white nationalist leader, he unfortunately decided to reaffirm

236
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,840
that cardboard cutout that had been made of him.

237
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,680
Because I think in some way it was like a vicious cycle where the more attention he

238
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:49,080
got from playing that role, the more he felt like he should reaffirm it.

239
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,080
That's the objective though.

240
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,080
Yeah.

241
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,080
Right?

242
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,080
Yeah.

243
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,080
Well, it wasn't my objective.

244
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,080
No, no, no.

245
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,800
The objective of people who are putting labels on people like Spencer and you.

246
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,800
Exactly.

247
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,800
So he fell right into the trap.

248
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,040
He fell right into the trap.

249
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:07,000
And unfortunately, I wasn't given the material resources to be able to resist that any more

250
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
than I did.

251
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,160
And at a certain point, specifically when Charlottesville happened, I couldn't endorse

252
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,120
the direction that the organization was going in.

253
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,120
And so I resigned.

254
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,880
I resigned also from my position as editor-in-chief of Arktos.

255
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,000
And then within about, and I predicted this, I did an interview with NBC right after I

256
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,780
resigned from the Alt-Right Corporation and I predicted that the organization would be

257
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:33,320
embroiled in infighting and it would disintegrate and implode within a very short time after

258
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,320
I left.

259
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,320
And that's in fact what happened.

260
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,920
I think it lasted about six to eight months after my resignation and then imploded.

261
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,040
Yeah.

262
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:48,200
Such is a story of human civilization that it's really, really difficult to bring people

263
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:56,200
together, especially when there is establishment mainstream status quo kind of a force that

264
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,560
is playing the arbiter that I've never heard anybody describe Alt-Right the way that you

265
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,560
did.

266
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,080
And I've never heard until maybe two weeks ago that Steve Bannon start talking about

267
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:11,840
the purpose of the populist movement today to prevent people who are in charge today

268
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,120
to be in charge when the singularity happens.

269
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,320
But other than that, this is the first time I'm hearing any kind of a directive and any

270
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:27,600
kind of a coherent technologically based argument and direction coming from the right.

271
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:34,040
And I think this is a huge gap that exists within the right that they're not talking

272
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,200
about.

273
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,800
What are we going to do in this coming decade to create some kind of a viable alternative?

274
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,880
Because the far left is taking over Google AI department.

275
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,100
There's a civil war going on right there right now, which I'm mind blown.

276
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,800
Nobody's talking about it.

277
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:57,920
They're targeting all the right places while the other side is talking about you can't

278
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,560
even get the election rights.

279
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,800
That is so obviously flawed.

280
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,040
Well you mentioned Steve Bannon.

281
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:12,480
This is a book that I would recommend to people who are interested in Steve Bannon.

282
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,560
I'm not entirely happy with the portrayal of me in this book.

283
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:23,400
I think this guy did a pretty good job overall, but about 30 pages of this book are focused

284
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,400
on my efforts to unify the alt-right.

285
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:32,360
And the reason I wind up making an appearance in this book is because those who promised

286
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:38,040
the capital investment in the alt-right corporation had actually, I mean this is what they claimed.

287
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,640
They had intended to make me a liaison between the alt-right and the White House.

288
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,000
And Steve Bannon was supposed to be the interface person.

289
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,760
I was supposed to be the guy who would go into the White House and talk to Steve Bannon

290
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:56,320
in a kind of respectable fashion on behalf of some more colorful characters in the alt-right.

291
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,440
And so it doesn't surprise me at all that Bannon would make these remarks about preparing

292
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:05,960
a political ideology that would be adequate to handling the challenges of the technological

293
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,960
singularity.

294
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,960
Because in fact that was exactly the discussion taking place when it was proposed that I act

295
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,320
as this liaison.

296
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:19,880
So yes, I mean, you know, big tech is in bed with the Chinese.

297
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:25,800
And you know, whether it's Google, who's effectively, you know, a front for the CIA, or whether

298
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:31,400
it's, you know, Facebook or Twitter or whatever, these companies are, or Amazon, these companies

299
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,880
are in bed with the Chinese.

300
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,620
And the worst thing that could possibly happen is for the Chinese to take the lead in developing

301
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,600
genetic engineering as they are right now.

302
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,200
I mean, they are literally, I think last week a story came out that they're genetically

303
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,440
engineering super soldiers.

304
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,520
And that was widely reported in the mainstream media.

305
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,440
So the worst thing that could happen is the Chinese take the lead in genetic engineering.

306
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,340
They take the lead in nanotech and AI development.

307
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:59,720
And the way in which they roll out these technologies, which have the potential to fundamentally

308
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:05,400
alter the parameters of human existence, are ways in which, are ways that are going to

309
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:12,400
lead to the degradation of human individuality, to the degeneration of the potential for genius

310
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,280
and innovative creative thought.

311
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:22,100
I can well imagine the Chinese using gene editing to recalibrate the human being into

312
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:28,920
something more, quote unquote, cooperative, into a more cooperative citizen, which also

313
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:33,280
by the same token is less capable of independent innovative thought.

314
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,440
So that would be an utter catastrophe.

315
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,160
And they're doing it right now.

316
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,160
They're doing it right now.

317
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,440
This is not science fiction.

318
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,440
Yeah.

319
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:48,360
And look, if we're left with a bunch of evangelical conservatives who are already interested in

320
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:55,400
bombing abortion clinics as our only resistance, we're screwed because there's no way that

321
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:00,160
a Luddite regressive right wing is going to be able to compete with the Chinese.

322
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:06,440
We need an archeo-futuristic right wing political ideology that is capable of embracing the

323
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,720
full scope of potential of these emerging technologies.

324
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,720
Yep.

325
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,720
That's exactly what it is.

326
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:19,040
And I'm not optimistic about, you know, I love United States, but I don't know what

327
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,040
it is.

328
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:26,480
Is it the openness of the system, or is it just a cultural, the evaluation of the culture

329
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,760
that exists in the system that a lot of it is religious?

330
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:35,760
Because Chinese have this opportunity to do genetic engineering without having this dead

331
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,120
end of do not interfere in God's business.

332
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,200
You know, while nobody else is talking about, well, it could be God's business that allow

333
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,440
us to genetically experiment with humanity, you know?

334
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,440
Like God's business don't end at any certain kind of a point.

335
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,960
So certainly not a Promethean God.

336
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,880
So please describe this Promethean God, because when I read, I haven't read the entire book,

337
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,360
but I read Julia Prisco's review and I read some excerpts of it.

338
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,920
It seems like it's a new, for lack of a better term, it's a new religion and a philosophy

339
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,360
merge into one for this coming age that has already begun.

340
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,360
Yeah.

341
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:21,320
So when you look at the myth of Prometheus, you know, there are certain principle characteristics

342
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:29,280
or basic elements of this archetype that could be the basis for developing a new socio-political

343
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,000
vision, right?

344
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,120
And so Prometheus, he's not just an enlightener God, the God who brings, you know, the fire

345
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,320
of the forge and the light of science to humanity.

346
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,960
He's also the creator of humanity.

347
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,040
You know, in Greek mythology, it's not Zeus who creates humanity.

348
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,640
It's actually Prometheus.

349
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:50,020
So you know, this whole vision we get in the Ridley Scott films of the engineers having

350
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:55,220
created humanity in their own image, that's very much in line with the Prometheus myth.

351
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:59,900
So when I, and then Prometheus is of course also the first martyr God.

352
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:04,800
You know, it's asked backwards to say that Prometheus is a Christ-like figure because

353
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:10,460
actually the image of Christ as a God who martyrs himself for humanity, for his children,

354
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:17,000
is something that's, it's basically being aped from the Prometheus myth.

355
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,400
Christ is aping Prometheus in so far as he's a God who sacrifices himself for his children.

356
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:29,800
So when I look at the whole structure of the Prometheus myth and then, you know, it's important

357
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:35,720
not to neglect the fact that the very first installment of this, you know, long story

358
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:42,560
arc of Prometheus before even the creation of humanity is that Prometheus rebels against

359
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,080
his fellow Titans.

360
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,320
So this guy, he's an inveterate rebel.

361
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:53,880
He rebels against his fellow Titans against Kronos or Saturn and helps Zeus come to power

362
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:59,480
and helps to install the Olympians only to realize that Zeus is almost as bad as Kronos

363
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:06,200
and then he schemes on behalf of humanity against Olympus and aims to also overthrow

364
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,660
Zeus.

365
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:12,040
So this is the God who's a rebel against all gods.

366
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:17,600
And so when I look at this whole story arc from Prometheus rebelling against the Titans,

367
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,280
helping Zeus come to power but then turning against Zeus being the creator of humanity

368
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:28,280
and then someone who gifts humanity with the fire of technological innovation and the light

369
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:36,000
of scientific knowledge after Zeus subjugates humanity to, you know, slavery and enforced

370
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,640
ignorance and then ultimately Prometheus being willing to be chained to the Caucasus mountains

371
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:48,120
and have his liver pecked out every day as a martyr god for humanity, certain basic characteristics

372
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:53,680
of Prometheus jump out at me that could be formulated into principles that would serve

373
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,360
as the basis for a new socio-political vision.

374
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,800
And I would lay those out in the following way.

375
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,800
I'd say there are about seven of them.

376
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,920
The first one would be Prometheus as forethought.

377
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,880
You know, the reason his, because his very name means forethought.

378
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,640
The reason his liver is being pecked out by Zeus's eagle is because the liver was used

379
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,200
for fortune telling in Greece.

380
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,520
It was like, you know, like tea leaf readers reading tea leaves.

381
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:28,080
So our people who look into crystal balls, a form of augury and fortune telling of prophesying

382
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,760
in archaic Greece was looking into the blackness of the liver by candlelight.

383
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:42,400
And so Prometheus is the god of forethought and the one who's always thinking ahead.

384
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,400
Prometheus is a creator.

385
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,520
He's the creator of humanity.

386
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,840
Prometheus is also an enlightener.

387
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:54,360
He fits into the category of all the enlightener gods like Quetzalcoatl or Enki or Ahura Mazda.

388
00:29:54,360 --> 00:30:00,320
He is an enlightener god who brings, you know, science and technology to otherwise benighted

389
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,520
humanity.

390
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:09,480
And Prometheus is also the god of exploration.

391
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:15,580
And this comes across particularly clearly in Shelley's rendition of Prometheus, Mary

392
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:20,560
Shelley's rendition of Prometheus, namely Frankenstein or the modern Prometheus.

393
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:27,680
There's a whole story within a story presented in that novel that's about, you know, Walton's

394
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:32,700
seafaring quest of exploration, breaking the Arctic ice and, you know, trying to conquer

395
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,000
the North Pole.

396
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,040
That's another aspect of the Frankenstein story that's often missed in popular culture

397
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:45,400
is that the quest of Dr. Frankenstein to re-engineer humanity is sort of complemented by this story

398
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,520
of Arctic exploration.

399
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:54,480
And so the explorer is analogized with the, you know, intrepid scientific genius working

400
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,980
in his laboratory.

401
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:01,520
And so I would say the exploration that's quintessentially characteristic of the Faustian

402
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,080
West is another, you know, aspect of the Prometheus mythos.

403
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,480
I mean, it's astonishing if you look at the history of exploration of explorers, you know,

404
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:17,320
mountain climbers, ocean explorers, all people who, you know, penetrated the Amazon jungle.

405
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,960
Almost all of them are from an Indo-European background.

406
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:28,360
So this is also another characteristic of the Prometheus myth, of the Prometheus archetype.

407
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:35,600
And then, you know, this will to enlightenment and this boundless exploration always yields

408
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:44,160
revolution because it is a resistance to the kind of stasis and stagnation characteristic

409
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,000
of different types of tyranny.

410
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,720
And so Prometheus is also, of course, the rebel.

411
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,960
He's the inveterate rebel who rebels against the Titans and then against the Olympians

412
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:59,560
and who inspires humanity's rebellion in the name of self-determination and being the masters

413
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,600
of our own destiny.

414
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:18,880
But then, you know, that rebelliousness is perhaps most interestingly expressed in the

415
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,440
trickster aspect of Prometheus.

416
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,160
Prometheus is also analogous to Loki and to the Coyote in Native American culture and

417
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:31,220
even to Hermes within the Olympian pantheon insofar as he's a trickster figure, the god

418
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,940
of machination.

419
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:37,760
And there's a way in which, and I think Heidegger has this very right, if you look at the phenomenon

420
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,840
of technological science historically, you can see technological science itself as a

421
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:49,140
kind of trickery or machination, a cunning or contrivance that involves various kinds

422
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,120
of duplicity and deception.

423
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,960
But it's a deception that's motivated by the will to resist a superior power.

424
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,560
It's like, you know, David versus Goliath.

425
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:03,240
And interestingly, you know, in Ridley Scott's Prometheus prequels to his Alien films, he

426
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:07,280
names the android who is this Promethean figure David.

427
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,880
So it's the machinations of David against Goliath.

428
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:16,980
It's using cunning and slyness and stealth in order to outwit, you know, a power that's

429
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,200
superior in terms of brute force.

430
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,780
You also see this as a characteristic of the Promethean.

431
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:25,980
And then finally, there's, you know, as I mentioned earlier, the willingness to sacrifice

432
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:33,700
oneself for the sake of humanity, this kind of ultra humanism and altruism that we see

433
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:40,080
in Prometheus being willing to be bound in the Caucasus and, you know, suffer a fate

434
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,840
worse than death by, you know, having his liver torn out and regenerated every night

435
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,940
and pecked out again the next day by Zeus's eagle.

436
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:55,200
So the will to self sacrifice and ultimately martyrdom, you know, an idea that's very

437
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:01,420
significant in Persian culture, in our shared Persian culture, Shahadat, is also one key

438
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:04,720
element or facet of the Prometheus archetype.

439
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:13,360
So these seven, I would say, aspects of the Promethean ethos can be the basis for generating

440
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:17,560
the architecture, the architectonic of a new socio-political worldview.

441
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,100
Which is centralized in nature, right?

442
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:24,920
Because there is a point of alignment that these are the ideals that we are striving

443
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,920
for.

444
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,920
Yes.

445
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,080
So, yeah, please.

446
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,560
It's a point of orientation.

447
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,520
So I'm not a fan of democracy.

448
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:40,280
And every day I'm kind of proven right to myself that democracy is not a way forward.

449
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:45,720
And it seems like beyond this period that where we're going with respect to U.S. socio-political

450
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:52,500
gridlock right now, there is going to be something that is going to be somehow centralized.

451
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:57,420
That some kind of an authority is going to determine the direction, is going to be the

452
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,800
arbiter of meanings of all these terms that we are saying bravery.

453
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,400
Who is there to define bravery, right?

454
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,140
So how do you see we're moving forward here in the United States in the coming decade

455
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:15,040
from the Prometheus kind of a perspective?

456
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,080
And where are we right now with respect to everything that you said?

457
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:24,360
Because obviously these are all the quote-unquote good qualities that humanity should consider.

458
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,600
But we seem to have the kind of the problem that artificial intelligence right now has,

459
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,240
which is the alignment problem.

460
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:36,720
There is no point of, there is no goal, there is no objective for the entire humanity as

461
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,200
a civilization to move towards.

462
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,440
I agree with you entirely.

463
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,640
See, the problem is the United States of America was never intended to be a democracy.

464
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,640
That's right.

465
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:50,100
And if you go back and you read the writings of the founding fathers, whether it's James

466
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:57,480
Madison or Benjamin Franklin or Alexander Hamilton, these men loathed democracy.

467
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:03,480
They thought it was the most vile and incompetent form of government in history, okay?

468
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,560
And what they were actually trying to do, they considered democracy a quote, tyranny

469
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,600
of the majority, unquote.

470
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,640
And what they were actually trying to do was to protect the individual against the mob.

471
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,880
Which is the entire purpose of United States, basically.

472
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,680
That's the entire purpose of the United States, okay?

473
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,880
The rights that are enshrined in the Constitution of the United States, in the Bill of Rights,

474
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,360
and even more fundamentally, the rights that are the opening words of the true Constitution

475
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,520
of the United States, namely the Declaration of Independence, right, life, liberty, and

476
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,880
the pursuit of happiness.

477
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:43,720
These rights are rights belonging to the individual that are sacrosanct and to be protected against

478
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,160
the will of the majority.

479
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:51,000
The system was supposed to be such that even a 95%, you know, or 99% majority of people

480
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,560
in society cannot strip you of certain basic rights that are, quote unquote, God-given,

481
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,720
not in the sense that they have anything to do with the biblical revelation.

482
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,000
And if anyone thinks that, they should read Thomas Paine, read The Rights of Man or The

483
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:11,040
Age of Reason, you know, the writings of the neglected founding father of the U.S., whose

484
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,760
only sin was that he said publicly what the rest of them thought privately, right?

485
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:23,560
So the God-giveness of these rights has to do with this deist metaphysics where the human

486
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:27,960
mind is a microcosm of the cosmic order.

487
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:34,600
And so, you know, for us to be able to flourish and to expand out into the cosmos and fulfill

488
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:45,480
our human potential, we need to have a sociopolitical system that allows us to develop the reason

489
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:51,360
within us that reflects the macrocosmic order, the microcosm in which the cosmic order is

490
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,600
reflected in an embryonic form.

491
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:59,340
I mean, that was the way of thinking of the founding fathers, which is very much more

492
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:06,440
in line with kind of Promethean archetype than it is with anything in the revealed religions.

493
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:15,040
In any case, if you read Carl Schmitt, whose preeminent student, Leo Strauss, wound up

494
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:20,000
being a very influential political philosophy professor at the University of Chicago, if

495
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,960
you read Carl Schmitt in his writings on the concept of the political, the crisis of parliamentary

496
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:35,720
democracy, you see how liberals only made an alliance with Democrats because they were

497
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,840
both against the monarchy in the 1700s.

498
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:43,480
You had two very distinct schools of political thought, Democrats in the vein of Jean-Jacques

499
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,160
Rousseau, people who wanted to bring back democracy in some sense.

500
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,600
And you had liberals like John Stuart Mill.

501
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:55,840
And these two political tendencies were actually very much opposed to one another and stood

502
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,740
in very serious tension with one another.

503
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:06,520
But they made this kind of provisional alliance in order to defeat monarchy and to transform

504
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:14,440
feudal society into the kind of society based on free enterprise that we've had since then.

505
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,000
And so they created this hodgepodge liberal democracy.

506
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,560
This is a fundamentally incoherent ideology, liberal democracy, because the whole point

507
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:30,820
of liberal liberalism in the classical sense, not this crap that passes for liberalism today,

508
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:36,480
but the whole point of advocating for political liberty is to protect the rights of the individual.

509
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,040
Whereas a democracy inherently is based on the idea of majority rule.

510
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,520
And the other thing about democracy that most people don't understand is that when you look

511
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:51,540
at the really sophisticated theorists of democracy in the modern age, like Jean-Jacques Rousseau,

512
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:58,280
you see that they knew that democracy going all the way back to the classical Greeks is

513
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:04,760
always based on an implicit acceptance of a certain religious ideology.

514
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:10,740
You cannot have coherent decision making by a majority in a parliament or in a congress

515
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,420
unless they all believe in the same religion.

516
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:17,700
And this is something that hasn't been understood that democracy, I wrote about this at length

517
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,920
in World State of Emergency.

518
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,640
Democracy is inherently theocratic.

519
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,280
It doesn't have to be a literal theocracy like the Islamic Republic of Iran, but there

520
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:30,680
needs to be a tacit acceptance of a certain religious ethos so that you have coherent

521
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,120
long-term decision making in the polity.

522
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,120
A point of alignment.

523
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:40,840
And so then what happens to the minority of dissenters in a society, those individuals

524
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,840
who don't subscribe to the dominant religion?

525
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,600
Well, they get persecuted.

526
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:51,120
They get persecuted and ultimately, like Socrates, executed by a democratic assembly.

527
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:55,320
And so liberalism and democracy were strange bedfellows to begin with.

528
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,000
And I think what we're seeing right now in the United States is the disintegration and

529
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,160
collapse of liberal democracy.

530
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:05,360
And what we need to do is think about what kind of ideology ought to replace liberal

531
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:12,120
democracy and what I would like to see is a kind of political ideology where liberty

532
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:18,520
is central to the system that's proposed to replace the current system.

533
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:24,320
And the emphasis should therefore be placed on the liberal aspect of the American founding

534
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,640
ideology rather than on its democratic aspect.

535
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:33,360
And so we need assuring up of the rights of the individual, but that also cannot happen

536
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:40,280
without acknowledging some kind of point of orientation, which will not tyrannize over

537
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:46,560
society the way that the Democrats' acceptance of a theology, tacit acceptance of a theology

538
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:51,520
would tyrannize overall members of society, but it would be a kind of spiritual ethos

539
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:57,840
that actually protects differentiation and individuation and encourages the cultivation

540
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:07,960
and flourishing of the individual, a kind of supra religion or transcendent spirituality

541
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:13,160
which accommodates religious diversity within certain bounds.

542
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:18,480
You cannot allow religions to thrive in a society which are inherently intolerant religions.

543
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,680
I mean, this idea that freedom of religion extends to people who believe in religions

544
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:31,760
so dogmatic that they believe in executing those who are, you know, kofars or apostates

545
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,040
or whatever, that kind of freedom of religion is fundamentally incoherent.

546
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:41,040
It's the Achilles heel that's going to be the downfall of any political system.

547
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:46,380
And so it needs to be understood that, yes, there should be, you know, people should explore

548
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:52,780
spirituality in ways that are individualistic, that, you know, promote dynamism and diversity

549
00:42:52,780 --> 00:43:01,520
in society, but that cannot extend to sects or cults that are in favor of forcing a certain

550
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:08,840
religious ideology onto society and persecuting or even executing people who are considered

551
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,920
apostates.

552
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:16,900
So when it comes to Islam, that poses a very significant problem for us, you know, in terms

553
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:20,860
of how we're going to restructure, say, the political system of the United States and

554
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:23,940
ultimately provide a model for the whole world.

555
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:28,540
It's a problem for us considering that, demographically speaking, Islam will be the dominant religion

556
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:31,280
on this planet within the next 30 years.

557
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,940
So this is really interesting.

558
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:37,940
First of all, about nonsensical terms, Islamic Republic is another one of those nonsensical

559
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:41,500
terms that we have been dealing with in Iran.

560
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:48,740
And I talked about this many times in this podcast that before the success of a revolution,

561
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:54,420
there was an alliance between Marxists and leftists and Islamists around their common

562
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:58,180
enemy that was this capitalism and America and Shah.

563
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:04,540
I actually still have this book right here, Answer to History, that he talks about it.

564
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:05,980
He goes on and on and on.

565
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:11,300
And it's really interesting how he talks about students in universities, how they don't understand

566
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,980
anything about life and everything has been given to them.

567
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:18,960
And it's like, you know, we're going through a twilight zone because it's the exact same

568
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,220
thing that is happening in the United States right now, which suggests to me this goes

569
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:32,340
much deeper into human nature rather than being the outcome of any socio-political,

570
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,580
modern socio-political system.

571
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:38,420
Yeah, people don't want freedom.

572
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,820
People are terrified of freedom.

573
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:45,800
I mean, by people, I mean what Heidegger called Das Mann, the majority, the mass, the mob.

574
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,920
They don't want freedom.

575
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,920
Because they want security.

576
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,920
Is that it?

577
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,920
They want security.

578
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,920
Right.

579
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:55,980
They want just like, you know, physical security, the kind of security of, you know, whatever.

580
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:59,700
That's going to be guaranteed by a political regime, economic security in terms of social

581
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,260
welfare.

582
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,220
Most fundamentally, they want psychological security.

583
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:13,220
They want, you know, some kind of a belief system that will give them a sense of tranquility

584
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:21,660
and, you know, you know, it kind of, you know, inner calm and stability.

585
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:27,060
People generally do not want to constantly be challenged to expand their horizons.

586
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:33,260
And so, you know, the burden, burdensome task that is placed on our shoulders is how to

587
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:41,220
develop a socio-political system that's Promethean in nature when the majority of society is

588
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:47,740
very threatened by that, where the majority of society wants, you know, a kind of dogma

589
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:53,380
that you find in, you know, Christian evangelical interpretations of the Bible or Catholic traditionalist

590
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:58,500
interpretations of the Bible, where the majority of society might even feel more comfortable

591
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:04,900
with the kind of Confucian values that China wants to promote on a planetary scale than

592
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:11,660
they would feel with a, you know, Promethean socio-political vision.

593
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,100
So it's a problem.

594
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:17,380
It's a serious problem that we're going to face in terms of, you know, how to govern

595
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:26,860
a population that is really terrified of freedom and how to salvage the American project, which

596
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:30,140
was about defending, you know, human freedom.

597
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:35,380
But I think, really, we're in the eleventh hour right now, I mean, because we are coming

598
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:41,060
up against a moment that, you know, I think you can legitimately characterize as the end

599
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:46,020
of history, a kind of spike on the, you know, exponentially...

600
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,020
Human history, though, right?

601
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:48,020
Human history.

602
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,020
Yeah.

603
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:52,620
The end of human history and potentially the beginning of a post-human history, right?

604
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:57,380
We're approaching a moment when we're going to pass through some kind of a great filter.

605
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:02,860
And I want to make sure that we do get to that moment, that there is no artificial controlled

606
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:08,940
demolition of advanced industrial society and a kind of forced return to a neo-agrarian,

607
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:14,020
neo-feudal way of life and an imposition of traditional values, whether they're in the

608
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:18,580
form of Catholic traditionalism or whether it's Confucianist traditionalism or some kind

609
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,220
of global Islamic caliphate.

610
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:24,820
I want to make sure that we make it to the technological singularity and that the people

611
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:31,460
who pass through that great filter are the people who are actually interested in being

612
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:38,380
free and in cultivating themselves to the maximum.

613
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:44,780
So on Islam, I had this conversation with someone from The Federalist that I don't understand

614
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:49,660
how Islam is not in contradiction to the United States Constitution.

615
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:55,820
I understand it's a controversial thing to say, but the First Amendment, freedom of religion

616
00:47:55,820 --> 00:48:03,260
and separation of church and state that comes with it is not at all consistent with a religion

617
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:05,740
that demands submission.

618
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:06,980
Islam means to submit.

619
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:08,700
Muslim is the one who has submitted.

620
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:14,900
So it's a very valid question to ask if a practicing Muslim ends up in the Congress,

621
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:19,560
whether or not you're loyal to Islam or you're loyal to United States of America.

622
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,740
Practicing Muslims have no place in the United States of America, period, let alone in the

623
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:24,340
United States Congress.

624
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:31,900
I analyzed this in an essay called A Critique of Shiite Esotericism, A Critique of Shiite

625
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,340
Esotericism.

626
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:39,800
In my book, my anthology Lovers of Sophia, one of the essays in there, looks at the kind

627
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:44,180
of Shiite Esotericism that's supposedly the basis for the Islamic Republic that Ayatollah

628
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:49,320
Khomeini specialized in in his seminary years and so forth.

629
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:53,540
And it shows how this is not really authentic Islam.

630
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:59,580
And you know, this kind of Shiite Esotericism is not even authentic Shiaism of the Arab

631
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:03,980
kind that, you know, originated in Iraq during the time of, you know, after the martyrdom

632
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:07,220
of Hussein and so forth.

633
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:13,860
Shiite Esotericism is a kind of crypto-Zoroastrianism or crypto-mythraism.

634
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:21,220
And if you actually look at the Qur'an in detail, you see that it includes an entire

635
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,860
political constitution.

636
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:27,380
It is not just a religious text, the Qur'an is actually a political constitution which

637
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:30,860
was used to govern Medina in Muhammad's lifetime.

638
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:36,420
And there's nothing about, you know, the power struggle between, you know, Ali, you know,

639
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:41,380
Hassan and Hussein on the one hand and the Sunni caliphs on the other hand that would

640
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:47,700
suggest in any way that the Sharia which is proposed, not proposed, the Sharia which is

641
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:54,060
mandated in the Qur'an itself would in any way be abrogated by fatwas of ayatollahs or

642
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:57,620
subsequent interpretations by mystics or anything of the kind.

643
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:03,780
The transformation of Islam in that direction within the Persianate world was an attempt

644
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:09,260
by Persians to preserve their own pre-Islamic mysticism.

645
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:16,420
And you know, it was so effective within Iran and, you know, in sort of catalyzing the so-called

646
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:21,940
Islamic golden age that a lot of Western intellectuals have been mesmerized by this and confused into

647
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:24,600
thinking that this is actually Islam.

648
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:31,380
If you look at, you know, what is in the Qur'an, it's clear and people, I really refer to that

649
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:35,980
essay where I quote chapter and verse to just make this crystal clear.

650
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:39,980
Within the Qur'an, you are not allowed to disbelieve in Islam once you are born into

651
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:48,180
the Islamic community and believing in Islam is not just a testimony of faith, it is adherence

652
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:58,700
to a political code, a doctrine of jurisprudence that includes things like, you know, draconian

653
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:05,500
punishments for theft, the institutionalization of women's inferiority in society, all kinds

654
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,500
of property laws.

655
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,500
Yeah.

656
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,500
ISIS.

657
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,500
Yeah.

658
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,500
Yeah.

659
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,500
What was that?

660
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,180
ISIS.

661
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:17,340
Almost everything that ISIS practiced in Iraq or that the Taliban practiced in Afghanistan

662
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:22,980
is based right in the Qur'an itself and the Sharia law code that was promulgated by Muhammad

663
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,820
in his lifetime and used to govern Medina.

664
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,020
This is a fact.

665
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:31,940
And so again, to go back to what I was saying earlier, it's incoherent to understand freedom

666
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:37,940
of religion as a right that would include toleration and acceptance of people who are

667
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:41,940
fundamentally intolerant and want to strip everybody else of their freedom of religion.

668
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,020
This makes no sense whatsoever.

669
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:50,060
Now, I would say this is also true of certain like Judeo-Christian sects that are, you know,

670
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:54,620
firmly grounded in the Old Testament and that, you know, believe in using, I don't know,

671
00:51:54,620 --> 00:52:00,340
the Book of Leviticus or Exodus or something to develop a quote unquote biblical republic.

672
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:01,860
Those people shouldn't be tolerated.

673
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:02,860
Neither.

674
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:07,380
But demographically speaking, they're a lot less of a threat than Muslims are.

675
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:12,300
And the Bible as a text is fundamentally different from the Qur'an insofar as it was composed

676
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:17,840
by tens of different authors over the course of hundreds of years and includes many internal

677
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,820
contradictions as a result of that.

678
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:23,180
The Qur'an is much more like, you know, Mao's little red book.

679
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:29,180
It is a doctrinal document produced by one man with one vision at a particular time.

680
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:37,540
And yet he very clearly mandated that that vision be immutable and eternally applicable,

681
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:41,660
at least until, you know, the apocalypse.

682
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:48,060
So yeah, you're absolutely right that Islam in its authentic form doesn't belong in American

683
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:51,740
society, let alone that Muslims should be serving in the United States Congress and

684
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,780
taking their oath of office on the Qur'an.

685
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:57,860
It's absolutely preposterous and it's a fundamental threat to the republic.

686
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:58,860
It really is.

687
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:03,020
Ayaan Hirsi Ali said, the tolerance of intolerance is cowardice.

688
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:04,180
That's exactly what it is.

689
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:10,060
But Peter Boghossian was talking about there is a move in Jiu-Jitsu that it's like this,

690
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:14,340
that you hold on to your one arm that the other one can be.

691
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:19,140
And he said that this one, I'm sorry, this one is the far left, is a progressive left

692
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:22,080
that is hold on to the Islamists and the fundamentalists.

693
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:25,100
For as long as this stays here, nothing can be done here.

694
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:29,460
So it seems like, again, we're going back to this progressive left, the end of which

695
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:37,540
is centralized system of tyranny and new feudalism with Chinese Communist Party at the top.

696
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:38,860
It seems like it.

697
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:39,860
That's exactly right.

698
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:46,500
And, you know, this kind of deracinated identity politics is being used to promote that agenda,

699
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:50,820
which is one of the reasons why from the beginning of my involvement in the alt-right, I was

700
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:55,460
trying to take it away from identity politics in this kind of really narrow minded ghettoized

701
00:53:55,460 --> 00:54:04,500
sense and toward a grand vision of, you know, Indo-European shared destiny and a kind of,

702
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:11,420
you know, ethos that would be able to orient all of humanity in a way that allows us to

703
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:14,740
successfully navigate the technological singularity.

704
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:18,860
Are you familiar with Aubrey de Grey?

705
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:20,980
The gerontologist.

706
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:23,700
He has a very long beard and long hair.

707
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,540
He is the founder of Sense Foundation.

708
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:28,140
They're working on longevity and immortality.

709
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:36,080
Yeah, it's been years, but I remember looking at some of his, the genetic, the biotechnology

710
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,660
aimed at life extension.

711
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:38,660
Yes.

712
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:41,060
Research that he was doing in the early 2000s.

713
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:44,620
I think the last time that I looked at that stuff was somewhere in the mid 2000s, but

714
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:45,620
yeah, vaguely.

715
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:51,260
So the last time he was on Joe Rogan, he said what keeps him awake at night is that we're

716
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:57,780
five to seven years away from a major breakthrough with respect to longevity after which people

717
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:01,820
are able to live significantly longer lives.

718
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:04,700
And that will change everything that will change their philosophy, that will change

719
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:08,080
their priorities, that will change their expectations.

720
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:12,340
And he was saying what concerns him the most is that politicians that are policymakers

721
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:14,260
are not ready, which is a given.

722
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:21,500
They are not ready, but can that immortality be seen or relative immortality be seen as

723
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:28,040
this new point of alliance for humanity that goes against the practical practices of it

724
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:35,020
that you see that people are living beyond 100 and then maybe 150, 200 and many other

725
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:38,860
advancement will come in the meantime.

726
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:44,400
But in that also addresses problem with religions that everything that is being determined and

727
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:49,300
arbitrated on this life is based on some kind of an ideal that you will receive in the next

728
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:52,740
life because most people don't want to die.

729
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:59,700
Well, you know, I think it's even more profound than that because look, life extension is

730
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:00,700
one thing.

731
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:03,780
And now that you refresh my memory, I do remember, I mean, wasn't Aubrey DeGray involved in

732
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:07,620
those studies where they increased the lifespan of mice by two or three times, something like

733
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:08,620
that?

734
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:12,980
So it's feasible and it is right around the corner.

735
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:20,540
But I think that, you know, far more profound than any, you know, life extension through

736
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:30,380
genetic engineering, the effect of see, here's the thing in Prometheism, my recent book Prometheism,

737
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:36,140
I argue that the technological singularity is inextricable from what I call the spectral

738
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:37,140
revolution.

739
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:43,340
So this is the idea that as we get closer to the technological singularity in really

740
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:48,780
well-funded research programs that are aiming at developing strong artificial intelligence

741
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:58,940
or even as we try to, you know, develop an even more comprehensive, thorough going mastery

742
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:05,540
in editing the human genome, we are going to come up against anomalies in these research

743
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:12,500
programs, anomalies where, you know, as they're attempting to develop strong AI inside quantum

744
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:19,020
computers, they see instances of psychokinesis, anomalies in genetic engineering research

745
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:24,500
programs where there are mutations that cannot be accounted for by, you know, the reductive

746
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:29,460
materialist scientific paradigms that these researchers are doing their work on the basis

747
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:30,460
of.

748
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:35,660
They're going to need to, at that point, take into consideration, you know, the many decades

749
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:43,740
of research that's been done by parapsychologists and the AI research programs and genetic engineering

750
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:48,980
research programs leading us toward the technological singularity are in effect going to legitimate

751
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:55,020
the whole history of parapsychological research and bring about what I call the spectral revolution,

752
00:57:55,020 --> 00:58:03,180
which is a scientific revolution in some ways comparable to the Copernican Revolution and

753
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:08,580
the Darwinian Revolution, but much more profound because at that point, when we acknowledge,

754
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:14,420
you know, telepathy and other forms of extrasensory perception and psychokinesis and so forth

755
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:19,240
as legitimate, not just human abilities, but capacities that we see in various organisms

756
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:24,620
in nature, at that point, we will become conscious for the first time of the way in which scientific

757
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:27,980
paradigms condition and constrain our thinking.

758
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:34,980
And then we'll be able to engage in various research programs that are post-paradigmatic.

759
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:43,780
They can take place unrestricted by any one particular scientific paradigm and use various

760
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:48,720
theoretical models in order to accomplish different ends in terms of, you know, discovery

761
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,140
and innovation.

762
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:56,540
And so where I was going with this is that I think that the impact of that kind of spectral

763
00:58:56,540 --> 00:59:00,300
revolution on religion is far more profound than anything you're going to see as a result

764
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:03,380
of genetic engineering leading to life extension.

765
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:07,540
It's not just that, you know, people living 300 years or, I don't know, a thousand year

766
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:11,300
lifespans are going to understand spirituality differently.

767
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:14,700
They're going to be disabused of various religious dogmas.

768
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:20,540
Once AI researchers discover that there's a kind of consciousness that's not reducible

769
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:26,100
to the biological organism and that it can survive physical death and we can track it

770
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:33,380
as it does and we can potentially guide a soul, for lack of a better word, from one

771
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:40,860
body into another, potentially into an android body, once those kinds of capabilities are

772
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:46,100
developed within, you know, well-funded mainstream research programs, it's going to have an absolutely

773
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:50,780
devastating effect on revealed religion and all kinds of religious dogma.

774
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:56,660
And this is actually one of the reasons why I worry about the rise of China, because unlike

775
00:59:56,660 --> 01:00:02,140
Westerners who subscribe to, you know, an Abrahamic religious revelation, right?

776
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:08,260
I mean, Judeo-Christianity, like Islam, is a form of Abrahamic religious revelation.

777
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:13,740
Unlike Westerners who, you know, have this revealed Bible as the basis of the religious

778
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:22,300
belief system, the Chinese, you know, Confucian worldview is not going to be as destabilized,

779
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:27,340
there's not going to be as, you know, severe a sociopolitical upheaval, it will not be

780
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:35,220
as traumatic for them to process these breakthroughs in scientific research that legitimate ESP

781
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:40,260
and mind over matter, as it were, and, you know, that potentially present scientific

782
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:44,540
evidence for reincarnation, it will not be as difficult for them to handle those breakthroughs

783
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:50,340
as it will be for Westerners, particularly, let's say, evangelicals or traditionalist

784
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:55,900
Catholics who are going to be traumatized by these discoveries and immediately will

785
01:00:55,900 --> 01:01:02,260
brand the scientific researchers engaged in this kind of endeavor as agents of the Antichrist

786
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:06,140
who are promulgating black magic and sorcery.

787
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:10,020
And so we face potentially another crisis like the one that we did during the epoch

788
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:15,540
of the witch burnings, you know, when Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake during the Renaissance

789
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:16,780
and so forth.

790
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:22,300
And that's another of the major concerns that my project of Prometheism is trying to address.

791
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:26,000
That is a very valid concern because we've already seen the example of that with Google

792
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:34,940
Glass, how people got attacked in San Francisco and around Silicon Valley, the buses of these

793
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:40,020
companies were attacked just because of Google Glass, that somebody, actually the president

794
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:44,740
of the transhumanist party of United States I was talking to, he brought an interesting

795
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:49,420
angle that the problem with Google Glass was the elitist way that it was released, that

796
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:53,900
not everybody could have access to it, you had to be chosen, you had to be selected in

797
01:01:53,900 --> 01:02:00,200
order to have, but I think it goes beyond that, exactly what you said, that you use

798
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:05,860
China as an example, I always use Japan, that you go to a Shinto temple, you come out, you

799
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:11,000
see the most high tech, high rise, and then you go to a Buddhist temple that has a robot

800
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:18,020
priest that Japanese people who go to a shrine, they go and talk to that robot and they interact,

801
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:22,180
they're not kicking it, they're not offended by it, they don't think it's going to take

802
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:29,260
their jobs away, so that is the biggest uphill it seems like for the West, it's social adoption

803
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:34,000
of whatever kind of technology and advancement that is going to come because they work as

804
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,300
well as the society that adopts those kind of advances.

805
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:44,380
And this is one of the reasons why we need Japan and we need India as our close allies

806
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:54,040
and partners in this global Prometheus project, because like China, who is our primary adversary,

807
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:58,860
the Japanese and the Indians have a kind of spiritual orientation, non-Muslim Indians

808
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:05,840
of course, have a kind of spiritual orientation that will be able, will afford them the capability

809
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:10,260
of navigating these kinds of dramatic breakthroughs more effectively.

810
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:17,460
And so while I'm advocating an ethos based on the archetype of Prometheus, I certainly

811
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:25,660
would encourage the spread of Zen Buddhism or Vajrayana Buddhism in the West and a deeper

812
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:34,580
connection with the Indian branch of the Indo-European world, not to call it a civilization because

813
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:38,740
it's beyond the concept of civilization, but I would encourage certainly Westerners to

814
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:43,500
have a deeper appreciation of the various spiritual traditions of India, the various

815
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:51,900
forms of the Dharma there, as well as the Buddha Dharma that Japan, I think, really

816
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:55,500
is the greatest protector and defender of in our world today.

817
01:03:55,500 --> 01:04:03,520
So wasn't Iran Renaissance a project to bring the future Iran within this exact alliance

818
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,140
that you're describing?

819
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:06,540
That was exactly how I saw it.

820
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:11,500
And so I was working with them and with the alt-right at the same time so that I could

821
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:15,100
integrate these into a kind of global project.

822
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:23,980
And at one point, I thought that Iran would maybe be a great place to have a kind of United

823
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:32,340
Nations of the Indo-European world that, you know, America, you know, and Russia and maybe

824
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:38,020
even India, Europe as well, they all want to be the center of everything, right?

825
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:42,020
They all, I mean, they're used to being major world powers in the case of the United States

826
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:43,900
and Russia superpowers.

827
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:50,460
And so there would be great contention between America, Russia, maybe even Europe and India

828
01:04:50,460 --> 01:05:00,380
over, you know, being the center, being the heart or the brain of this global Indo-European

829
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:02,780
order, right?

830
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:08,740
And so I thought Iran could play a fascinating, mediating role and be a kind of crossroads

831
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:13,360
and nexus for the entire Indo-European world, including its Buddhist wing.

832
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:17,420
After all, I think a strong case can be made that actually the origins of Buddhism go back

833
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:18,420
to Iran.

834
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:20,220
That's a whole subject in and of itself.

835
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:24,700
Yeah, well, I've argued that Buddha was actually an Iranian Scythian and that it's not just

836
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:30,140
that Buddhism was fundamentally shaped by the Iranian colonization of North India under

837
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:35,380
the Kushans, so that Mahayana Buddhism is an almost entirely Iranian creation.

838
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:41,900
It's actually the case that, you know, I mean, there's a lot of evidence that Gotama Sakya

839
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:46,780
Muni was a Saka, that he was a Scythian himself.

840
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:50,300
This is in my book, Iranian Leviathan, I spend a couple of chapters on that.

841
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:53,420
So, you know, Iran is also very closely linked.

842
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:56,860
I mean, you know, there's a reason the Bamiyan Buddhas, the most colossal Buddhas in the

843
01:05:56,860 --> 01:06:01,220
world were in eastern Iran, Afghanistan being a bullshit country.

844
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:06,140
There's a reason why the most colossal Buddhas in the world were carved in eastern Iran.

845
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:10,840
Iran was, eastern Iran was, the Mecca of Buddhism for centuries and centuries.

846
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:17,180
So I thought Iran would be a great place for a kind of, you know, union of Indo-European

847
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:20,820
nations to coalesce.

848
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:26,820
But unfortunately, I found in the course of my work with the Persian Renaissance Foundation,

849
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:32,100
that my colleagues, you know, the leader of that organization, you know, and other high

850
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:39,700
level members that I was closely involved with, did not have that scope of vision.

851
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:46,220
And they also were too, in my view, deferential toward, you know, people in the State Department

852
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:52,660
and various American politicians who I just found, you know, as we say in Persian, chendish,

853
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:59,460
halvar, you know, hair-raising people, people who are like, you know, give me the creeps,

854
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:04,580
you know, John Bolton types and so forth, who are associated with, say, Mojahedin al-Khalq,

855
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:09,620
the MEK, the Islamist Marxist Opposition Group to the Islamic Republic, and various other,

856
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:15,920
you know, bad actors whose involvement in any change in Iran would, I think, compromise

857
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:21,760
the country's territorial integrity and allow it to be carved up and looted by various foreign

858
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,540
powers, Israel and others.

859
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:28,820
So you know, I had a falling out with them over that, unfortunately.

860
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:34,260
Yeah, I mean, Iranians, the way that you describe all these major countries are going to be

861
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:38,820
at each other's throats in order to who's going to lead this future world, that's how

862
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:41,960
it's been within Iranians forever.

863
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:46,700
You know, we don't have one reliable opposition to this.

864
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:49,740
I believe it's an occupying regime that is in Iran.

865
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:54,580
It has nothing to do with Iran and Iranians and the Iranian culture has occupied the country.

866
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:59,980
But you know, in absence of any kind of a valid opposition, forget about the vision,

867
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:03,660
because what you portrayed is obviously awesome and is ideal.

868
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:10,720
The other side of this is Iran just being torn apart as a result of some kind of a civil

869
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:18,620
war that, you know, it's completely possible in absence of this uber centralized kind of

870
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:23,540
a theocracy that has been formed in Iran, especially after Khomeini with Khamenei that

871
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:25,460
he, you know, everything is about him.

872
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:26,460
He's gone.

873
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:31,700
It's this vacuum of power, who's going to fill it, which part is going to fall out and

874
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:36,580
how the other countries surrounding countries and major powers are going to take advantage

875
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:37,580
of it.

876
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:42,100
Yeah, I mean, even though I remain in favor of an Iranian Renaissance, you know, as an

877
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:46,460
idea, I resigned from the Persian Renaissance Foundation, you know, where I was the senior

878
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:52,540
advisor to the executive committee, I resigned because I came to the conclusion and and you

879
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:58,420
know, let me say after being involved, like in actual practical, high level lobbying efforts,

880
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:05,100
let me leave it at that, OK, I became in various discussions with stakeholders in any potential

881
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:11,420
change in Iran, I became convinced that there was no viable opposition and that if an attempt

882
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:15,180
were made under the present conditions to overthrow the Islamic Republic, it would lead

883
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:17,380
to the territorial disintegration of Iran.

884
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:21,380
We would see a larger Azerbaijan to our north.

885
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:25,220
We would see, you know, the Iranian part of part of Azerbaijan that remains within Iran

886
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:27,540
amalgamated to the Republic of Azerbaijan.

887
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:29,300
We would see an independent Kurdistan.

888
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:37,020
We would see the majority of Iran's oil resources severed from a rump state of Persia, which

889
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:42,220
would be economically destitute because it loses the oil of Khuzestan that the Saudis

890
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:45,460
intend to turn into the Arab Republic of Al Ahwaz.

891
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:50,900
And then, of course, Baluchistan would become a fortress for Sunni terrorists coming in

892
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:52,140
from Pakistan.

893
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:54,420
So it would be an utter catastrophe.

894
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:59,740
And until someone can convince me, you know, that there is a viable nationalist opposition

895
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:05,220
that can cohesively govern the country, you know, in the wake of the collapse or overthrow

896
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:10,380
the Islamic Republic, I remain skeptical of whether it's such a good idea to do that at

897
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:11,380
this time.

898
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:16,580
Otherwise, and, you know, I'm not buying into nice words, it doesn't matter who says them.

899
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:18,580
I think we're way past that.

900
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:23,260
You know, this idea that like in Africa, I think this is in Nigeria, that they didn't

901
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:27,060
have landlines and all of a sudden they have cell phones.

902
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:28,220
It's like this.

903
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:32,000
There is a certain kind of insight and wisdom in that that, hey, we don't have to catch

904
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,220
up with landlines.

905
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:34,220
We didn't have them.

906
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:35,220
That's fine.

907
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:36,940
Let's catch up with whatever is coming next.

908
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:41,580
And I hear people, you know, the opposition of Iranians, they're saying we need democracy

909
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:42,580
in Iran.

910
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:48,260
Like, oh, my God, like, what are you talking about democracy in the decade that in five

911
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:54,780
or six years, it will be so easy for anybody to 3D print a weapon and say, this is what

912
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:55,780
I'm saying.

913
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:56,780
I don't agree with the majority.

914
01:10:56,780 --> 01:11:01,660
I'm just going to create my own zone that now they're creating all across the United

915
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:02,660
States as well.

916
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:03,660
Yeah.

917
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:04,820
Yeah, I agree with you entirely.

918
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:12,060
And also, you know, if you're a pro-democracy advocate in an Iranian context, you're a retard

919
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:14,100
because you don't understand your own culture.

920
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,100
Yeah.

921
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:19,260
I mean, I mean, it's I get incensed, OK?

922
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:25,500
If you understand square one about Persian political philosophy and the cultural identity

923
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:36,420
of Iran, Iran is the bastion of a political thinking that's an alternative to democracy.

924
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:37,420
Let's put it that way.

925
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:42,780
I mean, you know, Iran's great value to the wider Indo-European world is to help develop

926
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:47,740
a coherent, sophisticated alternative to democracy.

927
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:53,180
That's the kind of resource that our Persian tradition has to offer the wider Indo-European

928
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:54,180
world.

929
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:59,420
And the fact that Iran has gone into a democracy is, you know, losing sight of the fundamental

930
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:04,660
character and the greatest strengths of Persian political thought going all the way back to

931
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:05,660
Darius.

932
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:08,420
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

933
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:15,340
About United States, where we are right now is a weird place.

934
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:23,340
Some people say that, you know, we're at the edge of a precipice, which is true, absolutely.

935
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:26,860
But at the same time, you know, everybody talks about the revolution.

936
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:30,420
Not that many people are talking about the day after the revolution.

937
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:36,740
So with you having Prometheism and Prometheus movement as the point of alignment for your

938
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:42,780
perspective, first of all, where do you see United States is right now today and what

939
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:52,300
steps need to be taken for the US from today until the ideal place in Prometheism or according

940
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:57,420
to Prometheism perspective that you feel comfortable that this is the direction that we're headed

941
01:12:57,420 --> 01:12:58,420
towards?

942
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:00,300
Look, I'll be very honest with you.

943
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:05,860
I mean, this is a this is a question that's setting me up for a very what's going to be

944
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:09,100
a very controversial answer, but I'm not going to pull any punches.

945
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:11,780
I'll be very, very straightforward with you.

946
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:15,340
There are two potential tracks.

947
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:25,580
One and the one that I prefer, frankly, is that Trump uses every mechanism, every opportunity

948
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:30,500
open to him to make it clear that this election has not only been frauded, but that there

949
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:38,020
has been treasonous foreign intervention involved in an attempted theft of this election.

950
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:46,220
OK, and that the big tech people and the deep state officials, 50 of which had the courtesy

951
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:50,500
to introduce themselves to us when they signed that letter saying that the Hunter laptop

952
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:52,340
was a Russian disinfo operation.

953
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:53,740
This is unbelievable.

954
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:59,940
The audacity of these 50 former intelligence officials, including five former directors

955
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:08,180
of the CIA, to sign their names to a piece of paper that alleges that there was this

956
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:14,620
Russian disinfo operation promoting the Biden laptop story when there's not a shred of evidence

957
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:15,620
for that.

958
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:19,980
And it's now since been admitted that Biden is under investigation.

959
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:24,700
This is actually spectacular because what these people did was they basically gave us

960
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:28,900
a roster of the members of the deep state in the intelligence community.

961
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:30,540
We know who they are now.

962
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:31,900
We know who they are.

963
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:36,780
And we know that the same big tech people who are screwing around on Twitter and on

964
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:41,460
Facebook to suppress the New York Post story, to block Donald Trump's tweets despite his

965
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:43,460
being president of the United States.

966
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:48,340
We know these big tech people are in bed with China and we know that the Biden family is

967
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:50,340
in bed with China.

968
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:55,420
And so I want to see President Trump within the next, what is it now, 20 something days

969
01:14:55,420 --> 01:15:02,900
until January 6th, 30 days or so until the inauguration.

970
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:08,460
I want to see him use every avenue open to him, beginning with Director of National Intelligence

971
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:15,700
Radcliffe's assessment of the election, use every avenue open to make sure that he's the

972
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:20,020
one taking the oath of office on January 20th and continue into his second term.

973
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:25,020
In that event, there will be a massive violent uprising in all of the blue state cities.

974
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:29,100
And the president of the United States will be forced to engage in a civil war.

975
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:32,280
He will become the second president in the history of the United States after Abraham

976
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:37,300
Lincoln to have to go to war against his own people.

977
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:43,580
And I don't think it's coincidental at all that he chose a former national counterterrorism

978
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:46,100
director as his secretary of defense.

979
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:47,100
Green Beret.

980
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:48,100
Yeah.

981
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:51,180
You only do that when you're planning to go to war inside your own country.

982
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:55,620
That guy doesn't have a qualification to be secretary of defense if you're planning various

983
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:58,540
foreign endeavors and so on and so forth.

984
01:15:58,540 --> 01:16:04,780
He's focused domestically and it's an anticipation of waging a second civil war.

985
01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:13,100
So I would prefer to see that scenario unfold as bloody and as catastrophic as it may be

986
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:19,020
for a couple of years until all these people in the deep state are prosecuted and purged

987
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:20,300
from the system.

988
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:22,860
That would be much healthier for America.

989
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:26,340
And then we're going to get the kind of Trump administration that we wanted from the beginning,

990
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:29,780
one with General Flynn in it, one with Steve Bannon in it.

991
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:39,940
And this Prometheus vision that I have can then be like right off the bat in a very,

992
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:42,900
you know, gentle fashion.

993
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:51,180
It can be, you know, phase by phase introduced into the public political discourse and policies

994
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:58,180
can be, you know, tailored that are in a way that's inspired by this worldview.

995
01:16:58,180 --> 01:16:59,180
Okay.

996
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:05,460
And, you know, it won't become immediately explicit, but over time we can, you know,

997
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:09,980
we can at least inspire policymaking in the second Trump administration in the same way

998
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:13,260
as the neocons did during the George W. Bush administration, right?

999
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:18,180
I mean, in the same way that Leo Strauss's political philosophy inspired some of the

1000
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:24,000
policies, detrimental policies of the W. Bush administration, we can in a positive sense

1001
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,540
philosophically inspire policies beginning with the second Trump administration.

1002
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:34,560
I think that's the more favorable course as catastrophic as it will be in the near term.

1003
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:40,420
The second possibility is that, you know, Joe Biden will be sworn in on January 20th

1004
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:46,260
and we're headed for a few years of Biden and then potentially a 10 year long Kamala

1005
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:52,500
Harris presidency because I don't see how if they were able, if the deep state was able

1006
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:58,460
to rig this election with Donald Trump in control of the executive branch of government,

1007
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:06,260
now after four years of their total control of the government, Trump or anyone else opposed

1008
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:09,300
to the deep state will be able to prevail in the 2024 election.

1009
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:10,500
I just don't see it.

1010
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:14,700
So I think we're headed for a very long term struggle.

1011
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:21,300
And then I think, you know, we would have to kind of retreat within ourselves for a

1012
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:28,660
certain period of time, develop a very, you know, sophisticated, coherent, complex, not

1013
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:36,700
only political ideology, but a program and also develop an alternative platform for communication

1014
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:43,100
and organization because they're going to close all the doors of social media to us

1015
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:44,180
within those four years.

1016
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:48,060
The crackdown on Twitter and Facebook and so forth and YouTube where you can't even

1017
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:51,740
discuss the election fraud anymore are going to become much worse.

1018
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:58,140
And it will be imperative for the right to develop an independent tech platform and network.

1019
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:06,000
And we're then engaged in a long term struggle that will not afford us another opportunity

1020
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,320
for direct intervention until probably about 2032.

1021
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:15,140
And unfortunately, if that happens, if that's the track we wind up on, when the change takes

1022
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:24,740
place, it will be far more violent and vicious than it would be in 2020, in 2021 rather.

1023
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:25,860
I absolutely agree with you.

1024
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:28,740
I mean, this is not a normal kind of a situation.

1025
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:30,660
This is not a political conflict.

1026
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:35,180
This is really a philosophical and the conflict of meaning.

1027
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:38,620
What is the purpose of us living in this country?

1028
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:40,300
And you know, what's the purpose of this country?

1029
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:41,300
Just be the country.

1030
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:42,700
You know, where are we headed?

1031
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:46,700
So most people don't know and even less people know about what we talked about with respect

1032
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:47,700
to technology.

1033
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:49,740
I'm very happy that you're on the right.

1034
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:54,400
And I'm very happy that you said you actually it was a point to make this connection with

1035
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:59,080
Steve Bannon inside White House because I'm not hearing it from anybody else on the right.

1036
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:04,940
But what I'm hearing is unbelievable backlash towards transhumanism that I'm saying, hey,

1037
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:11,140
I agree with you if the transhumanism is controlled by a centralized entity like the Chinese Communist

1038
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:12,140
Party.

1039
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:17,460
But transhumanism, it really is a civil right issue of our time that if somebody wants to

1040
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:23,020
merge and go beyond our biological boundaries, it's no one's business to tell that person

1041
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:27,900
that you're not allowed to experiment with your own body or you're not allowed to experiment

1042
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:32,620
with joining this kind of a network or developing this kind of a system that could threaten

1043
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:33,620
us.

1044
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:38,620
But you know, we're headed towards, as you said, very who knows, who knows, but conflict

1045
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:45,100
is something that is definitely going to be guaranteed because, you know, we are redefining

1046
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:50,540
meanings and the fundamentals of our civilization that we have taken for granted for many, many,

1047
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:51,540
many centuries.

1048
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:52,540
Yeah.

1049
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:57,140
You know, and in terms of transhumanism, it's not as if the federal government of the United

1050
01:20:57,140 --> 01:21:05,120
States needs to adopt some kind of a uniform policy with respect to, you know, the potentials

1051
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:09,320
of biotechnology or, you know, cybernetic enhancement.

1052
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:19,000
The United States is the nation that could potentially emerge as the leader in terms

1053
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:28,300
of, you know, transhuman evolution of humanity precisely because of the scope of liberty

1054
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:35,420
that's left to the individual within states that are allowed to determine their own policies.

1055
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:40,620
You know, the United States Constitution with the liberty that it grants to various states

1056
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:46,580
to develop their own policies with respect to, you know, public health and technology

1057
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:52,500
is, you know, potentially the country that could advance most rapidly in terms of these

1058
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:53,500
technological developments.

1059
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:59,620
I mean, you know, I draw another analogy that is going to get me into trouble, but the fact

1060
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:04,740
of the matter is that in the 1920s, the United States was the world's leader in eugenics.

1061
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:10,300
The Germans copied the Americans in terms of eugenics.

1062
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:15,260
And I'm certainly not in favor of compulsory sterilization or any kind of old school eugenics.

1063
01:22:15,260 --> 01:22:21,500
You know, the whole point of contemporary emerging biotechnologies is that, you know,

1064
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:30,500
they are enhancements that, you know, one can opt in or out of on an individual basis,

1065
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:31,500
right?

1066
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:37,500
I mean, there's no reason why these kinds of genetic modifications should be compulsory

1067
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:40,500
or there should be some top down federal approach to them.

1068
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:43,540
But if we simply leave it in the hands of the states, the way that the federal government

1069
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:48,280
left eugenics in the hands of the states in the 1920s and 30s, you'll get all kinds of

1070
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:51,820
different policies in different places and people who want to benefit from these kinds

1071
01:22:51,820 --> 01:22:56,420
of technologies will move to, I don't know, Nevada, you know, Colorado, wherever, you

1072
01:22:56,420 --> 01:23:00,340
know, that have more liberal policies in that respect.

1073
01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:01,860
And so that's all that needs to be done.

1074
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:07,500
We just need to make sure that on a federal level, there's no ban on these technologies

1075
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:11,900
in the way that there is going to be in Germany or other parts of Europe.

1076
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:12,900
Yeah.

1077
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:16,820
Away from concentration of power because power corrupts absolute power crops.

1078
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:17,820
Absolutely.

1079
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:22,740
Yeah, we don't want the Chinese approach where there's going to be state mandated genetic

1080
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:28,420
engineering potentially, you know, with deleterious consequences on a population wide basis.

1081
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:33,660
But we also don't want a state mandated ban on various uses of these technologies.

1082
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:38,500
If it's if it's done constitutionally with proper respect for states rights and for the

1083
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:42,060
rights of the individual, then, you know, the United States could even leap ahead of

1084
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:45,740
China in terms of, you know, seizing the potential of these technologies.

1085
01:23:45,740 --> 01:23:46,740
I totally agree.

1086
01:23:46,740 --> 01:23:51,900
I mean, the possibilities are so in contrast to each other.

1087
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:54,460
It's insane that we're at this point in history.

1088
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:58,660
The book is called Prometheism by Jason Reza Georgiani.

1089
01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:01,380
This was such a pleasure having you on the podcast.

1090
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:02,900
What's next for you?

1091
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:04,900
And where can people our audience follow?

1092
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:09,980
I will add all the links to your website and the books and everything when the episode

1093
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:10,980
is released.

1094
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:12,820
But where can our audience follow your work?

1095
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:18,420
Well, my website is Jason Reza Georgiani dot com, Jason Reza Georgiani dot com.

1096
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:22,620
And it has links to all of my books, to my videos.

1097
01:24:22,620 --> 01:24:27,780
You know, I've done tens and tens of interviews that are linked there as well as to my social

1098
01:24:27,780 --> 01:24:28,780
media.

1099
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:29,780
That's all linked at my website.

1100
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:36,380
And, you know, my latest book after Prometheism is this novel which just came out.

1101
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:40,700
It's a sci fi horror novel and my first work of fiction.

1102
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:44,700
And I think your audience in particular would probably find this at least as interesting

1103
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:45,700
as Prometheism.

1104
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:46,700
Amazing.

1105
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:52,060
Thank you so much for introducing us to your new book and congratulations.

1106
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:53,060
Let me ask you.

1107
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:54,060
You're welcome.

1108
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:55,060
Yeah, absolutely.

1109
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:56,060
Let me ask you the last question.

1110
01:24:56,060 --> 01:25:00,640
I ask all my guests that if you come across an intelligent alien from a different civilization,

1111
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:05,500
what would you say is the worst thing humanity has done and what would you say is our greatest

1112
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,500
achievement?

1113
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:14,700
Oh, man, that is profound.

1114
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:24,900
The worst thing that humanity has done, the worst thing that humanity has done, my God,

1115
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:26,340
we've done so many awful things.

1116
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:31,620
But all of the awful things that we've done have been an expression of our willingness

1117
01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:34,780
to sacrifice freedom for security.

1118
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:39,460
And I would say the worst thing that humanity has done is to misunderstand its fundamental

1119
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:40,460
nature.

1120
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:45,140
I think that what defines the human being as opposed to various organisms in nature

1121
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:49,940
that have a kind of species being, you know, what Aristotle called the species being, certain

1122
01:25:49,940 --> 01:25:56,420
characteristics that are hardwired into them by their biology, what distinguishes humanity

1123
01:25:56,420 --> 01:26:06,700
is the abyss of existential freedom and the demand on us to define our own character,

1124
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:10,260
to shape our own character and to define our own destiny from out of the way that we've

1125
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:11,260
shaped our character.

1126
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:16,500
And I think it's precisely because we are so free on an existential level that we are

1127
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:19,540
constantly enslaving ourselves in various ways.

1128
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:25,380
Since we are a species that is not hardwired in any particular way, we compensate with

1129
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:28,260
all these rigid ideologies.

1130
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:32,940
And it's not at all clear that that would be the case with various intelligent extraterrestrials.

1131
01:26:32,940 --> 01:26:37,260
There may be intelligent extraterrestrials that are more like a beehive or termite colony

1132
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:38,660
than they are like us.

1133
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:42,980
They may actually be hardwired in certain ways despite their capacity to develop advanced

1134
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:44,220
technology.

1135
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:51,060
And so what I would say to them is that, look, I mean, if let's say I come across a representative

1136
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:58,300
of a hive-minded species, a kind of borg, I would say to them, look, our greatest sin

1137
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:03,260
is that we sacrifice the freedom that we had and that you don't.

1138
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:11,700
We gave up on the gift, the natural gift that we were given of the freedom to define ourselves

1139
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:14,740
and to be the masters of our own destiny.

1140
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:21,280
We squandered what it is that you people never even had in the first place to make ourselves

1141
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:22,940
more like you.

1142
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:24,780
That's probably what I would say.

1143
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:30,300
And in terms of our greatest achievement, humanity's greatest achievement, I mean, it

1144
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:33,940
would be the same answer taken positively rather than negatively.

1145
01:27:33,940 --> 01:27:40,420
It would be all of those moments in history when beginning with Cyrus the Great and Zarathustra

1146
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:47,260
and ending with Philip K. Dick and Jackson Pollock, all of those moments in history where

1147
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:58,020
we explored our existential freedom to the maximum and we produced just stunning works

1148
01:27:58,020 --> 01:28:07,060
of innovative creative genius and basically redefined the limits of the possible.

1149
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:12,940
And I think that, in fact, in any potential encounter with extraterrestrial intelligence,

1150
01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:15,100
that will be our greatest strength.

1151
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:20,220
Our scientists, our engineers will have nothing to teach those people.

1152
01:28:20,220 --> 01:28:26,580
It's our artists, our philosophers, our writers, our musicians that will have something to

1153
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:30,940
offer in any encounter between humanity and an extraterrestrial intelligence.

1154
01:28:30,940 --> 01:28:41,420
And so maximizing the conditions for creative freedom, I think, is a priority in terms of

1155
01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:46,300
any imminent encounter with an extraterrestrial intelligence, because it's in that event that

1156
01:28:46,300 --> 01:29:13,500
we will have the most to offer to them.
