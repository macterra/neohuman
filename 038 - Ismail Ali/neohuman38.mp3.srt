1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,080
You know, in the same mindset that it takes to believe that we need to make America great

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:11,360
again, or we need to bring back these old policies because they have some sort of value

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:18,200
that we've lost by changing, you know, by progressing our policies, that there's also

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:24,020
this kind of nostalgia for a time where people, frankly, had less information, they knew less,

5
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:36,320
they were less educated, and that's easier to manipulate and easier to control.

6
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,200
Hello and welcome to the 38th episode of Neo Human Podcasts.

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,680
I'm Aga Bahari at Agologist on Twitter and Instagram, and you can follow the show on

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,680
LiveInLimbo.com, iTunes and YouTube.

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,680
With me today, I have Ismail Ali.

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,680
Welcome to the show, Ismail.

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,680
Hi Aga.

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,680
It's great to talk to you.

13
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,680
Thank you for the invitation.

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,680
I much appreciate it.

15
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,680
My absolute pleasure.

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,280
Why don't we start by hearing a little about your background, the work you've done, and

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,680
what are you focusing on mainly now these days?

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,680
Sure.

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,520
Well, it's kind of hard to talk about the work that I do now without giving a little

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,480
bit of kind of personal background.

21
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,680
I'm the child of two immigrants.

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,080
I was born and raised in California, but my father came from Pakistan and my mother came

23
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,360
from Colombia in the 1980s.

24
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,560
They both kind of left their respective countries as a result of either economic or political

25
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,560
pressures.

26
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,480
They both left their countries to the United States to avoid and to kind of ensure that

27
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:42,040
their children, myself and my brothers, could avoid some of the political and economic conflict

28
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,480
that they were experiencing in their home countries.

29
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,440
The reason I bring that up is because so much of my own experience and so much of my own

30
00:01:51,440 --> 00:02:00,600
kind of political and personal professional route has been influenced by my own context

31
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:07,000
and my own political context and my own awareness of how very real kind of political, economic,

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,720
and other structural oppressions affect people like my family and myself and my community,

33
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,400
but also the people around me and my friends and my allies and the people that I've seen

34
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,920
in the world.

35
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:25,680
So that just general framework really had me very aware of and interested in very complex

36
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:33,680
political dynamics, especially around foreign policy and how the United States dealt with

37
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,840
both foreign and domestic policy in the post 9-11 era.

38
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,560
I was 11 years old when 9-11 happened and a lot of the response of the US government

39
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:51,160
after 9-11 to Muslim communities in the United States, but also to people around the world,

40
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,640
significantly influenced my own political leanings and I really saw or I felt like I

41
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:03,080
saw very clearly the result of how different forms of oppression articulated themselves

42
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,520
in different parts of the world and that led me really early to be really interested in

43
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:13,720
issues of multiculturalism and kind of religious dialogue and intercultural dialogue, not only

44
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:19,340
because I myself represented a combination of a variety of cultures, but also because

45
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:27,080
I realized that there was so much of the suffering that I saw was a result of not just miscommunication

46
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:35,240
but really this deep perception of misalignment between values that I think may not actually

47
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,560
exist and are rather there because of these historical and long-term oppressions and structures

48
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,800
that are built to maintain those structures, maintain those oppressive structures.

49
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:50,480
So I've been really critical of kind of the status quo, the political status quo for many,

50
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,480
many years.

51
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,960
I was marching against the war in Iraq in 2002, even before it started when I was a

52
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:00,240
really small child and spent most of my teenage years really critically kind of engaging with

53
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:06,440
issues of foreign policy and domestic policy, which then led me really directly to very

54
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,360
seriously critically engage with issues of mass incarceration and criminality in the

55
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,160
United States.

56
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,500
Over the course of my undergraduate and then my law school career, I focused a lot on civil

57
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:24,380
liberties and civil rights and how they were protected or restricted by not only US but

58
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:30,400
other governments and eventually kind of that brought me to a really acute awareness of

59
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,160
the war on drugs and how the war on drugs has been this mechanism and this tool of not

60
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:44,600
only criminal but also social control throughout the last few decades with the epicenter of

61
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,900
that process being the United States.

62
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,620
So that led me to work at the American Civil Liberties Union where I did some criminal

63
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:59,360
justice reform work and I did some other policy work in 2015.

64
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,880
In the year after that, I spent a lot of time researching human rights and really brought

65
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,120
this general feeling of discomfort around the way governments treated their citizens

66
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,680
to a more kind of theoretical place where I was really trying to connect the oppressions

67
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,680
that I was seeing with and hopefully the solutions for those oppressions I was seeing to these

68
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,760
larger concepts which I later discovered were really well articulated in the international

69
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:32,120
scheme for human rights and that all led me to really thinking critically about access

70
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:38,240
to healing and the role of healing in change over time and changing these structures and

71
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,360
that kind of dovetailed really directly and really easily into what became the work that

72
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:50,680
I do now which is essentially political and policy advocacy work for the Multidisciplinary

73
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:56,800
Association for Psychedelic Studies which it was formed as a research organization to

74
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:03,000
kind of bring MDMA in particular out of the illegal criminal context that it was placed

75
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:13,020
in in the mid-80s into a legal medical framework and I'm now seeing this shift from focusing

76
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:20,800
primarily and only on research as a method of change in education into a greater expansion

77
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,040
into connecting these issues of access to healing, of access to medicine, to not only

78
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:34,320
issues that challenge the framework of the drug war but also really align it with these

79
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:40,280
bigger values that I've been thinking about for so long like human rights and social justice.

80
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:46,560
That's amazing. You obviously have had some experiences with psychedelics yourself, right?

81
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,120
Yes, I have.

82
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:54,040
Yeah, and so have I. I'll give you a little bit of background about myself. I came from

83
00:06:54,040 --> 00:07:01,160
Iran as a refugee and I was in love with America all my life. That was the goal to make it

84
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:08,400
to America because everything that was good was coming from America and all the pressure

85
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,580
and all the difficulties and all the complexity that I had to deal with as a child and growing

86
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:21,240
up in that environment. I tried to seek help in different ways from talking to psychologists

87
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:28,280
and gurus and mentors and life coaches and stuff and then I ended up trying psilocybin

88
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:36,920
mushrooms in Vancouver, BC and that was life-changing experience for me because for me it brought

89
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:43,560
out everything that I had in my mind and articulated in a very emotional way that I'm sure you

90
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,640
know what I'm talking about but it's kind of difficult to describe it to people who

91
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:56,080
haven't tried it and it really was life-changing for the best. I stayed with it not like doing

92
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:03,120
it all the time but with psychedelics you cannot do it all the time. You take two, three

93
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,840
grams of mushrooms and the lessons that you've learned you have to process for the next week

94
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,680
or two but what's interesting to me about you is that do you find any political organizations

95
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,320
in today's America that you can affiliate with because I don't hear that much of a pro

96
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,600
drug overall, a pro psychedelic narration from either of the parties.

97
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,960
So I want to comment on a couple of things you said before answering that question because

98
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,420
you just brought up a lot of really, really interesting concepts and I just pulled up

99
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:39,680
a study that the Guardian just reported on. This study came out really recently, we had

100
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,480
last Wednesday that found that mushrooms are actually the safest recreational drug and

101
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,280
they just did a really big study where they looked at who sought medical treatment after

102
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:55,120
using a variety of different drugs like MDMA, LSD, cocaine, cannabis. They found that one

103
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,680
of the riskiest drugs was synthetic cannabis which is really interesting because synthetic

104
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,080
cannabis is primarily used by people who are getting drug test and who can't use real cannabis

105
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,480
so it's primarily a function of the prohibition of cannabis that synthetic cannabis is even

106
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,600
a thing and second they found that people who took mushrooms, I mean this is all the

107
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,720
study occurred over the course of 2016 but they said that out of 12,000 people who were

108
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,480
reported taking psilocybin mushrooms, 0.2% needed emergency medical treatment which is

109
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:30,360
five times lower than that of MDMA, LSD, and cocaine. It's just funny that you say that

110
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,000
specifically because there's now increasing evidence that magic mushrooms, in particular

111
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:44,720
psilocybin in particular, is one of the safest drugs in the world and the unfortunate reality

112
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:51,720
is that most people who have bad experiences is people who pick their own mushrooms and

113
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,440
eat the wrong mushrooms that are toxic rather than psychedelic. It's interesting that you

114
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,280
bring up your experience with psilocybin because I too had an experience with psilocybin when

115
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:08,680
I was young that really significantly changed my own perception around my own political

116
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,900
kind of state and my own understanding of my role in the world that I think has had

117
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,920
a tremendous impact on the work that I've been doing. I just wanted to comment on that

118
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,440
before going on because it's an interesting parallel and something I very much resonate

119
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,200
with and I think a lot of other people resonate with too. Even though I hear what you mean

120
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,960
that talking about it to people who have an experience can be challenging, it's also true

121
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:39,680
that for many people who have, whether they're in the West or not, the kind of enduring universality

122
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,760
of the experience is something that a lot of people share.

123
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,920
Going to your question around political affiliations, it's interesting that you ask that because

124
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:55,560
first and foremost, there haven't been that many organizations, well there really are

125
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:01,760
very few organizations that are actively open about being, as you say, pro-drug users and

126
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,400
supporting specific use of specific substances. It's actually kind of funny, the first time

127
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,640
that I had a conversation with the Drug Policy Alliance a few years ago, they're now one

128
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,640
of our big allies at MAPS. We work a lot with the Drug Policy Alliance and we support their

129
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:22,960
work a lot. They focus a lot on harm reduction, they've done a lot of work on mass incarceration

130
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:29,060
and cannabis laws, but one of the first questions I had for them was, I wonder what is it that's

131
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:35,460
preventing you from being pro-drug use, being open to not only minimizing the harms but

132
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:39,240
also recognizing some of the benefits?

133
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,880
The response, which I think was very reasonable, is that at this point in time, this was a

134
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,600
few years ago, not only was there not necessarily enough evidence to say, well, anyone should

135
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:57,480
be coming out in favor of drug use, whatever that means, but also that we hadn't yet fully

136
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,120
explored the nuances of what we meant by drug use, whether it's in psychedelic or other

137
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:10,720
contexts. So much of the conversation generally, and this is true also in political spaces

138
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,460
with respect to people who are responding to the war on drugs, is based on what people

139
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,760
perceive as much more urgent needs, so dealing with harm reduction from injection drug users

140
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,280
and ensuring that people who take substances are taking them in settings that are safe

141
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:32,320
and that have the auxiliary support necessary for people who have challenging experiences,

142
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,640
whether it's with a psychedelic or another substance. So we at MAPS are really cautious

143
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:45,600
because although our work has really focused primarily on research and because we've published

144
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,240
quite a bit of really impressive research, especially with respect to the studies that

145
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,200
we've conducted ourselves about MDMA for PTSD, it's also true that we've sponsored

146
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:01,200
and worked with other organizations to study other things like Ibogaine and like Ayahuasca,

147
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,600
both of which have a very different profile of use, a different cultural context, a different

148
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,960
kind of framework of use that almost places them, that some people believe places them

149
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:20,080
in a different category than something like MDMA or even LSD or heroin or cocaine. So

150
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,760
to kind of loop back around and really answer your question, one of the things that we're

151
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,840
trying to do at MAPS and that I personally have really been spending a lot of time and

152
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,480
effort to work in, along with my colleague and supervisor, Natalie Ginsburg, who's the

153
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,920
Policy and Advocacy Manager at MAPS, is really kind of figuring out what that space looks

154
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:44,560
like. What does it really mean to advocate for this, not just for more research, but

155
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:52,680
also for access to these substances? MAPS' goal is to create legal, safe and legal context

156
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:58,040
for the medical, cultural, and therapeutic use of these substances. And in order to have

157
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:05,040
those structures, we need to have a clear understanding of our identity, both as advocates

158
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:11,360
and as people within the movement of access to the substances. Just to finish this thought,

159
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,960
I think one of the biggest mistakes that people made in the 1960s was, you know, really increase

160
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:24,360
discussions around access to the substances, but did not bring with it the structures within

161
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:30,880
which those substances could be safely done. Education. Exactly. And also, I think one

162
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:38,320
big piece of it is also, one great example is that a number of indigenous cultures, including

163
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,600
ones who've used ayahuasca and iboga and a number of other substances, have been using

164
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,360
psychedelic substances for years and years and years in a variety of contexts with little

165
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,160
to no negative consequences. And that's partially because they have these systems in place,

166
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:57,320
not just education, but also these like really large, complex social systems that allow

167
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:03,120
people to be both educated and then well supported in the process of taking the substance and

168
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,120
afterward. And that just didn't exist in the 1960s. We kind of got access to LSD and

169
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,280
mushrooms and then imploded. You know, there really wasn't that structure that needed

170
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:15,400
to happen. And that's what we're trying to do now is create that structure. Education

171
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:22,280
in the broader sense is what I mean that, because to me, it seems like all the conclusions

172
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:27,920
that are needed in order to policies being built upon them are non-existent now because

173
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,720
we can't even have a conversation without being completely rejected. You know, you can't

174
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:39,680
talk about ayahuasca and LSD and mushrooms and not being compared to cocaine and meth

175
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:48,840
and crack and you know, it's just a very alienated subject that majority of people, even if they

176
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:54,640
don't want to deal with it themselves, they automatically and by default, they're defensive

177
00:15:54,640 --> 00:16:01,040
towards it. Absolutely. Absolutely. And you know, even you know, as drug policy advocates,

178
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:07,040
because although you know, I and my colleagues work with psychedelics primarily, we're also

179
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,480
you know, at the end of the day, we're also drug policy and criminal justice reform advocates

180
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,280
because the issue is not only just the structure, but it's also the fact that the current scheme

181
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,720
criminalizes the behavior, which makes any sort of safe structured use that much more

182
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:27,840
difficult. So we're very cautious to avoid throwing other drugs under the bus because

183
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,640
we really do believe in compassionate responses to people who use any substance, you know,

184
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:37,080
whether it's heroin, whether it's meth, whether it's mushrooms, but also recognizing that

185
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:43,720
there, there, there has been this kind of like unfortunate kind of blanket stigma attached

186
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:50,160
to any sort of mind altering substance, which is simply put like kind of an uneducated and

187
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,160
unevident response that isn't based in evidence, excuse me, that's what I'm trying to say,

188
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:02,800
but it's based much more on those initial miseducation or fear based responses that

189
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,360
were really promoted by a variety of past past administrations, presidents, governments,

190
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:14,320
whatever that has kind of set into the public conversation that like exactly as you said,

191
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,680
if we're going to be talking about these substances, we have to be talking to them in the context

192
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,600
of the harms and the toxins and the bad things that they do, which kind of goes back to your

193
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,080
early question, it's like, well, we're now getting, you know, this is the big change

194
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,320
that's happening right now in the midst of what people are calling this psychedelic renaissance,

195
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:38,400
which is that, well, we now are getting clinical evidence of, of, of facts that people have

196
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,640
have speculated about and suspected for years and years and years, you know, people in the

197
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,280
West have been speculating for decades now and for, for indigenous communities, you've

198
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:51,120
been working with some of these substances for literally centuries, if not longer. And

199
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,120
we're finally starting to get to a point where talking about these structures, these regulatory

200
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:02,560
structures is simply put no longer, you know, theoretical pie in the sky woo woo nonsense,

201
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:08,800
because we really need to start thinking seriously about, you know, if, if we, if maps will have

202
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,560
gone through the FDA approval process, you know, there's a simultaneous, the same simultaneous

203
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,160
process for psilocybin research in the United States. It's also going through the FDA approval

204
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:23,720
process. If in five years, we have legal prescription access to either both of these substances

205
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:29,520
in specific cases for specific people, we need to know how to do it. We can't pretend

206
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,400
like we, we already have this, the solutions or the structures because we don't. And we

207
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,400
also can't pretend that, you know, any conversation about them isn't relevant because they are.

208
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,520
We're now at a point where we really need to be seriously thinking about like, well,

209
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,480
what, you know, who's funding it, who's getting access to it, how is insurance dealing with

210
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,520
these are questions that are very relevant for other issues of, you know, of kind of

211
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:55,800
medical treatments that just aren't at all live yet in the world of psychedelics, just

212
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:01,120
because we're still kind of working to get taken seriously by the rest of, by the rest

213
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,720
of, uh, by the rest of the people who haven't caught on yet. I'll say that we're definitely

214
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,400
getting taken seriously and rightfully so by a number of people because the evidence

215
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,880
is just coming out and it's just so good. But, you know, there's still a lot of that,

216
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,840
that stigma to, to, to counteract. That's very true. Um, what is the current state of

217
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:25,560
war on drugs? Because we were getting very close to have a general conversation about

218
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,640
legalization of marijuana all across the U S and here in Canada. And then Trump administration

219
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:37,080
happened and Jeff session and all of that. So how, how are we doing now? That's a really

220
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,800
good question. And it's, you know, I, I'm going to give an answer, but I can tell you

221
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:49,320
that I have yet to hear anything very secure. And that's not because people, anyone knows

222
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,680
more or less than the other, but because there's so much chaos occurring in the current administration

223
00:19:53,680 --> 00:20:00,440
in the United States that it's kind of unclear how the power dynamics will shake out. And

224
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,800
as a result, you know, just practically speaking, we at maps are being very, you know, we're

225
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,940
treading pretty cautiously because what we want to make sure that we have some clarity

226
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:11,200
with respect to how the federal government will be dealing with, you know, moving forward

227
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:17,320
on the war on drugs before we start making any big moves. I will say that from our perspective

228
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,880
at maps, the, the research that we're doing is still going to go forward. The studies

229
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,240
that we're working on will still continue. We, we're not planning on making any dramatic

230
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,960
changes to the work that we do based on this, on this shift in part because we work so closely

231
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,080
with the FDA and because the FDA has been so supportive and accommodating of the process

232
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,360
of this research because, you know, they, they're at least, you know, in, to the extent

233
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,680
of, to the extent of the amount that they've worked with us, really interested in figuring

234
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,040
out the truth behind the legitimacy of these substances. And the only way you can do that

235
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,560
is with, you know, rigorous scientific evaluation, which is exactly what we're doing. But more

236
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:58,360
generally on the question of the war on drugs, I have to say that there, there's kind of

237
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,920
mixed feelings in the drug policy community about, there's a solid percentage of people,

238
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:07,760
myself included, that are, I think, rightfully skeptical because people like Jeff Sessions

239
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,440
and others who are kind of coming, it's kind of like a blast from the past. You know, a

240
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,760
lot of people are really seeing it as this attempt of the crit administration to go back

241
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:22,160
to fifties fifties, if that right. Like I've been, you know, you look at some of the rhetoric

242
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,280
and it's not, it's not so far off of the rhetoric that you hear, that you heard in like even

243
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:31,840
like the thirties when they were first attempting to criminalize cannabis. And generally speaking

244
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,720
going backwards is not a good idea, but going back to those particular areas, I think is

245
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,160
the, is particularly dangerous because that's where, you know, that, that was the origin

246
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,820
of a lot of the rhetoric and a lot of the behavior that we now see articulated in these

247
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:49,160
extremely high rates of incarceration for, for black and brown Americans and for poor

248
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:55,960
people all over the United States and in other places. So, um, I, I'm, I'm a perma optimist.

249
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,960
I always, I'm trying to look at the bright side and I have to say that as, as scary as

250
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,040
it is, and as much as, as much as it's true that a number of people will be very rapidly

251
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:11,520
and dramatically negatively affected by this attempt to return to these kind of like old

252
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:18,000
outdated beliefs that, you know, incarcerating more people and finding and doing more kind

253
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
of increasing criminality is a good thing, which, which I think so much research and

254
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,840
so much of our experience has proven otherwise. Um, I do believe that what's happening right

255
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,000
now in the United States, especially, but this is true around the world, it's kind of

256
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,120
this, um, unearthing of this shadow that, that has kind of been lurking in American

257
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,240
culture for a really long time. You know, the thing about the Korean administration

258
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:46,320
is that we're not really seeing, especially for those of us who've spent many years, myself

259
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,360
and we've spent many years being really critical of the American political establishment, you

260
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,200
know, what we're seeing is not exactly a surprise, you know, where I'm not, you know, a lot of

261
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,880
us are not necessarily surprised that, you know, people can be this bad or can be this

262
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,520
kind of reactionary. It's mostly scary to see the kind of public support that's coming

263
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,200
out in favor of it. And I think that that process, and again, this is the optimist in

264
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,400
me, maybe it's night and maybe being night, but I do think it's just optimism that what

265
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,600
we kind of need to go through this process of seeing how bad things really are before

266
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,120
we can properly deal with probably deal with solutions. And ironically, that makes it kind

267
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,680
of like a psychedelic experience where, you know, you got to deal with some of the bad,

268
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:33,320
like the bad, traumatic, intense, challenging things before you can get to healing. And

269
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,440
I think what's happening right now with both the war on drugs and just generally in the

270
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:41,320
United States is this process of really unearthing all of that trauma that people have tried

271
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:47,600
and failed to, you know, keep in the ground. And I think that this is really how we can

272
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,160
really understand what are the real problems and what are the solutions? How do we actually

273
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,160
deal with it?

274
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:58,760
Yeah, well, it's clearly a subject interesting to large group of people. And it's not like

275
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,840
war on drugs or tougher policies are going to stop them. All it had done is just empowered

276
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:10,460
people in the black market, whether in this reality or internet and darknet to, you know,

277
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,400
buy anything they want with Bitcoin. I know people who have done that. It's not it's not

278
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:20,020
a very hard thing to do. You can do it really easily. But what you're saying is very true.

279
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:24,840
We don't really know the risks and we don't really know the full potential that we can

280
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:30,600
get from these drugs to help each other and help the world. Because the connectivity of

281
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:36,000
it is is is an interesting aspect to that how internet is connecting us with each other,

282
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,800
the sense of how we're connected to everything else when we're doing psychedelics. It seems

283
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:47,560
to be something that politicians are trying to avoid to face, right? So do you think ideologically,

284
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:52,580
they also have something against it that, hey, if you do mushrooms and LSD, you realize

285
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:59,120
that Jeff Sessions or Trump or Clinton or none of those people are really addressing

286
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,880
the real issues that you have to deal with on a personal level?

287
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,840
Absolutely. So it's it's funny that you mentioned the internet because I think that what I think

288
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,520
I'm calling the internetification of the world, which is just this interesting kind of like

289
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,920
rapid connectivity, which, as you say, is like a total game changer for society. I think

290
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:24,280
that we can I think that you can kind of see some sort of analogy between the fight for

291
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:32,440
net neutrality and access information like free accessible information that that parallels

292
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:37,760
what we're seeing with access to other kinds of knowledge technologies, including psychedelics.

293
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,360
I think that, you know, I try not to be a cynic, but at the at the at the end of the

294
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:50,040
day, when I see, you know, repeated attempts by politicians and others to restrict access

295
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:56,720
to information, which is really like the one of the most unifying things about being about

296
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:02,040
a human society, which is this increase in access to education and access to information,

297
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:08,280
which is such a crucial piece of liberation, both in a physical and physical, literal and

298
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:15,880
a mental kind of paradigm. The I can't help but wonder what, as you say, like what what

299
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:20,920
are the what is motivating these people to be so reactionary and frightened about it?

300
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:26,080
I think that we can get some of that information by looking at how exactly, you know, drug

301
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:31,560
control systems, especially like control systems for psychedelics, were kind of originated

302
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:39,440
in the late 60s and early 70s as a response to not only this really, really vibrant youth

303
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,480
led antiwar movement, but also this dramatic societal shift that was kind of this backlash

304
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:51,880
from what people saw as this idyllic American dream that was kind of created in the 1950s.

305
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:57,960
And I believe that, you know, that in the same, you know, in the same mindset that it

306
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:05,400
takes to believe that we need to make America great again, or we need to bring back these

307
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:10,680
old policies because they have some sort of value that we've lost by changing, you know,

308
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:16,800
by progressing our policies, that there's also this kind of nostalgia for a time where

309
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:22,560
people frankly had less information, they knew less, they were less educated, and that's

310
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:30,680
easier to manipulate and easier to control. I don't necessarily believe that the current,

311
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:36,880
the current, you know, continuation of criminality around psychedelics in particular is directly

312
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,680
related to this giant malicious structure that wants to keep people kind of keep people

313
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:48,640
in their own kind of spaces, intellectual spaces. But I do believe that there is a fear

314
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,680
that having access to these altered mind states could result in, you know, exactly the thing

315
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:59,520
that people were afraid of, which people saw having in the 1960s, which is anti authoritarianism

316
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,520
or behavior that's seen as being misaligned with the social order. I think the big mistake

317
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:09,120
there is that, A, well, there's two, I think there's two big mistakes with that. The first

318
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,040
being assuming that the current social order works for everyone, which is simply not the

319
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:19,520
case. It marginalizes and leaves behind full populations of people, Black Americans, Americans

320
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:26,000
of color, people of color around the world, people in countries that are currently being

321
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:33,240
directly targeted by the American Warfare Machine, people in the Global South who are

322
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,560
victims of the exploitation of the North and of the West. You know, there's all these populations

323
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:42,880
that are being left behind by the status quo. So that premise that the status quo works

324
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,880
and should be promoted right there from the beginning is flawed. And then on top of that,

325
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:53,360
the impression is that there isn't any value that can come out of this use. And I'm not

326
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:59,840
just talking about medically and therapeutically, but I mean from a broader interpersonal and

327
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,080
social perspective, which I think is another big mistake. I think that part of what's coming

328
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,880
out of this movement toward access to psychedelics, whether it's for medicine or for sacrament

329
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:16,240
or for personal development, kind of goes back to what you were saying earlier around

330
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:23,040
what exactly are the benefits here? And I think part of those benefits include a willingness

331
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:29,800
to recognize that restructuring certain aspects of society would not just be better for these

332
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:34,440
marginalized populations that I mentioned, but also just better for everybody because

333
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:40,560
we've tried systems that have clearly failed to work and that maybe finding alternatives,

334
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:44,840
whether it's with the help of personal development or personal work through use of psychedelics

335
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:49,440
or sacred medicine or whatever else or some other method. I'm not claiming that taking

336
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,320
mushrooms is like the way we're going to create the new society, but I do believe that there

337
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,480
is ought to be said for the kind of mind state that psychedelics can promote and how that

338
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:02,560
creative open space can be really, really positive, can result in positive outcomes

339
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:10,080
for this longer term development and creation of not just alternative, but more articulated,

340
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,080
more honest and more free societies.

341
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:17,400
Absolutely. And I just want to add to that a part of your introduction, a MAPS website

342
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:22,520
that says that you believe that psychedelic consciousness is crucial piece of challenging

343
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:28,080
oppression in all of its form and the legal access to psychedelics is an essential part

344
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,280
of a progressive drug policy paradigm.

345
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,280
Absolutely. Yeah.

346
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:35,560
So it's very important. And what's interesting to me is that a lot of the negative narrative

347
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:44,440
is coming from the religious side. And yet Jesus himself was one of the most famous activists

348
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:52,240
against the status quo. And at the same time, the religious experiences that certain people

349
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,400
have on psychedelics, there are a lot of studies that shows maybe Moses, for example, had a

350
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,560
psychedelic experience as well.

351
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:05,840
Absolutely. I think it's very interesting that a lot of the people who are a lot of

352
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:11,800
the characters that have been kind of touted as being spiritual leaders, the Prophet Muhammad

353
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:16,480
in Islam, Jesus, Buddha, a lot of these characters are pretty psychedelic figures in the sense

354
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,640
that if you read about their lives and what they've done, they have this, one of the most

355
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:32,520
universal characteristics of really very influential religious leaders is this deep generosity

356
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:40,520
and this deep willingness to be open to compassion to others, in particular people who are suffering.

357
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:44,280
And I know plenty of people who I know, I know plenty of people who've taken psychedelics

358
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:48,320
and who haven't necessarily developed that. So I don't want to, you know, again, act like

359
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,620
these are silver bullets.

360
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:56,520
That said, there is no doubt in my mind that for many, many people, myself included, maybe

361
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:01,520
for you, for a lot of others, access to psychedelic spaces, and this is kind of what the comment

362
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,600
in my bio is about, access to that kind of psychedelic state of mind and psychedelic

363
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,560
really just being a proxy here for an open and articulated frame, open, creative and

364
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:16,880
articulated frame of mind. It is one of the most enduring characteristics of what people

365
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:23,760
see as deeply mystical, if not deeply mystical and often spiritual beliefs, which lead to

366
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,160
religious structures. The commentary that you're making is really interesting. So I

367
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:34,340
was actually, I was raised Muslim. My mother was Catholic. My father was Muslim. My mother

368
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:38,560
converted to Islam later in my life and I was raised Muslim. I still identify as Muslim

369
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:43,560
and I've been thinking a lot about the intersection between the mystical experience, both in Sufi

370
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:48,880
Islam and also in other faiths and in the psychedelic experience and in how there is

371
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,720
so much that I think that modern religious structure can learn from the freedom and the

372
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,680
openness of the psychedelic experience. And frankly, although I'm personally very critical

373
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,400
of a lot of the way that institutionalized religion has been articulated, especially

374
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,720
politically in the world today, I do believe that the psychedelic world can learn a lot

375
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:14,360
from how indigenous structure, indigenous cultures and other long-standing religious

376
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:21,760
and spiritual traditions have held that space and have created containers where not only

377
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:28,800
the experiences can be had, but also that the maximum benefit of something like mysticism

378
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:34,560
or the mystical experiences that come out of psychedelic experiences can be best articulated

379
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:40,640
not only in the individual who takes it, but also in their personal relationships and in

380
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:50,040
a larger sense in society. One of the most amazing gifts I think that indigenous sacred

381
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:55,120
plant medicine use has that I think that the West and the general psychedelic culture could

382
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:04,160
learn a lot from is the use of rites of passage and initiations. I think that we as people

383
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,800
who are experimenting with our minds in a variety of contexts, whether we identify as

384
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:13,120
psychonauts or whatever else, are kind of seeking out that initiation, seeking out those

385
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:17,000
mystical experiences, or else we wouldn't be called to eat like a random mushroom that

386
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:23,880
we heard. There's this kind of like deep courage and curiosity in people who seek access to

387
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:29,280
psychedelic spaces because they kind of have, whether it's conscious or not, they have

388
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:35,600
found and we have found this alignment between this deep spiritual seeking and this state

389
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:39,840
that some of these substances are able to promote. And I think that that's where kind

390
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,840
of getting to your point around where the opposition lies. I think that that can be

391
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:50,200
seen as a threat for traditional religious structures. And I recognize that direct access

392
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:56,800
to divinity or to mysticism can be threatening to structures that require mediums or require

393
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:02,280
some sort of buffer between divinity or God or great spirit or whatever.

394
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,280
Middle man.

395
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:09,160
Exactly. Exactly. Some sort of middle structure. I think that psychedelics really totally obliterate

396
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,360
that middle structure and show every person that they can have a direct connection to

397
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,800
whatever that larger power is, which is kind of scary for some people.

398
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,520
Yeah. I think the problem actually is shared between organized religions, certain organized

399
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:29,600
religions and nation states that they don't want to lose the exclusive access to knowledge

400
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,680
and information that they've held for hundreds of years.

401
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,680
Definitely.

402
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:39,400
Yeah. And I don't really know how it's going to conclude itself. I think people like you

403
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:45,260
are heroes. I think you're doing the greatest work that anybody can do because you guys

404
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:51,000
are not giving people fish. You're teaching people how to fish in the best possible way.

405
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,920
That is, take that medicine and learn about yourself and learn about your surrounding

406
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,280
and learn about your environment from your perspective because it really gets to, we

407
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,960
talk a lot about artificial intelligence on this show and how we're getting to the point

408
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:14,240
that we have to address core characteristics of what makes us human. Is it ethics and morality?

409
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:19,160
But not many of them are objective like laws of physics. These are our subjective perspective

410
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:23,440
dependent and psychedelic seems to be the best tool to discover that.

411
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,880
Yeah. Well, I first want to say, I really appreciate you saying that because I feel

412
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,360
very deeply honored to be doing this work.

413
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,720
I really do think so. It's not an easy thing to do and it's potentially dangerous work

414
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,720
to do.

415
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:43,260
Yeah. And I am looking forward to the day that, you know, it's not just a handful of

416
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:47,120
us that are like kind of putting ourselves on the front lines to do this because not

417
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:51,120
only is it like, just from a professional perspective, it's such an interesting space

418
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:56,400
to be in, to be on the cutting edge of these kind of kind of big social changes. But also

419
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,240
as you say, like, you know, we need a lot of input from a lot of people. There's a lot

420
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:06,560
of communities that have been left behind in the process of nation state building and

421
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,840
knowledge structuring and access to information that have been left out of the conversation.

422
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,960
And I think the only way that we're going to be able to create a society in the long

423
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:21,640
run that really truly is, you know, does avoid the repeated oppression that you and I have

424
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:27,360
been discussing over the course of this conversation and more is by exactly as you say, making

425
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:32,120
sure that people have the tools to get access to their own truth. So then they can bring

426
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:36,680
that truth, they can bring it forward into, you know, the greater conversation, which

427
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:42,520
is really about a co-creative space. It's about hearing what are the various needs of

428
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:47,320
all of the people that are affected by any given policy or any even structure and including

429
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:51,160
them in that conversation. And the only way I believe that they can be fully and truly

430
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:56,760
included is if, you know, these the people themselves have that awareness of their power

431
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:02,680
and of their access, which I think, as you say, like, is very, very, you know, I think

432
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,600
psychedelics are one of the most consistent and effective ways for that to happen. And

433
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,920
they're not the only way, but they work really well. And they work, you know, consistently

434
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:16,360
in a way that a lot of other modalities, whether it's meditation or whatever else, don't or

435
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:21,000
at least at least that takes so much longer to do. And frankly, we're we are in a time

436
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,040
of crisis, you know, all of the optimism that I've got still can't shield me from the fact

437
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,600
that we are living in a time of crisis, both with respect to climate change and with respect

438
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:34,440
to authoritarianism in the world, with respect to this really toxic relationship between

439
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:39,840
huge religious structures and nation states, wielding, wielding, you know, aggressive this

440
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:45,640
monopoly on violence, I think affects so many people around the world that, you know, if

441
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:52,200
the work that we do can even free the minds, free the minds of a few people at a time,

442
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:57,720
you know, one experience at a time, ideally in legal context, where it's safe, where they

443
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,120
don't have to worry about criminality, where they don't have to worry about negative effects,

444
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,040
where they have kind of auxiliary support structure that I think people really need

445
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,880
for responsible psychedelic use and for responsible substance use use, then we can see that, you

446
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,760
know, that pro drug position or at least that position that some substance use can be really

447
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,920
beneficial for some people is not so radical after all. I mean, we've got this serious

448
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,400
dedication to, you know, the pharmaceutical drug model. So it's not like it's unprecedented

449
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,000
that putting a substance in your body can be good for you. We're really just trying

450
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,840
to show that the substances that people have been so afraid of for so long fall into that

451
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:38,440
category also. Yeah, we're alcohol. And I should add, not only fall into that category,

452
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:43,200
but expand that category beyond our understanding. It's, it's really not just about having more

453
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,000
pharmaceuticals and having more, you know, structure within the medical context. It's

454
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,200
really about using the medical context as one vehicle for access through legal access,

455
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,800
which which can be in a variety of different kind of contexts, depending on depending on

456
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:02,640
the needs. And, you know, hopefully, hopefully down the line with a diversity of options

457
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,440
that that have been kind of sourced from the people themselves from the community themselves

458
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:11,920
of people that need it. Yeah, absolutely. I've always been very open about my positive

459
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:17,000
experiences with psychedelics. And when I say positive, not all of them were smooth

460
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:23,240
sailing, you know, I've had a lot of what people call bad trips, but even those I think,

461
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,400
you know, it's something that you it's something inside of you that you have to deal with.

462
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,880
And once you deal with it, that bad trip all of a sudden turns into one of one of the most

463
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:36,720
valuable experiences of your life. But I never advocated that, hey, you definitely have to

464
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:43,160
go and take it because it affects different people differently. But I think public education,

465
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:49,200
as is the case with technology, that any technology works as well as a society that adapts it.

466
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:55,920
This seems to be the same case that as more educated the society is better results and

467
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:03,560
better future. These kind of studies that are so fundamental to who we really are. Yeah,

468
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:07,880
will turn out to be in our societies. So yeah, I really do think you guys are doing a fantastic

469
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,840
job and a great job. And I wanted to ask you about the recent conference that you guys

470
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:17,760
also had with maps. If you can talk a little about that. Sure. Yeah. So we just had it

471
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:24,280
was in April 2017. So it was just about a month and a half ago. Now, we had our, I think,

472
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:31,400
third psychedelic science conference, which was the largest convening of psychedelic researchers

473
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:37,360
and kind of therapists and people who work in the psychedelic culture, of all time, to

474
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:42,520
the extent of our knowledge, there were almost 3000 people, I think we had about 2800 attendees

475
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:49,800
from almost 50 countries that were there for a variety of reasons, but really in particular

476
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:58,080
to get updated on not only the state of the science, so the state of the formal, legally

477
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:03,000
sanctioned investigations that are happening at research centers around the globe, but

478
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,880
also to get kind of clicked into where exactly the movement for legal access to psychedelics

479
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:14,280
actually is, which is a question of both the research and the culture and kind of the social

480
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:21,480
political conscious context, which we've kind of been discussing a bit in this conversation.

481
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:28,240
It was overall a humongous success. I think that there was over, you know, there are literally

482
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:33,440
over a hundred separate sessions, there were community forums and film screenings, and

483
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:39,080
of course lots and lots and lots of scientific presentations, and it was interesting because

484
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:46,880
it kind of represented this checkpoint or kind of like a watershed moment for the movement.

485
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,200
People have been talking now for a couple years about this renaissance that's occurring

486
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:55,800
in the world of psychedelics because after 30 or 40 years of totally dead space when

487
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:02,520
it came to research into psychedelics between the late 70s, early 80s and today, there's

488
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:10,400
been this major increase in funding and actual, like funding for investigations to investigations

489
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:15,520
themselves and to content and kind of like conclusions being drawn out of these investigations.

490
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:20,000
So for the first time in many, many years, we're getting this rapid increase in access

491
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:27,880
to information about exactly what psychedelics do and what context, and that amazing increase

492
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:35,120
in information has resulted in this really serious reconsideration of how the movement

493
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:40,880
generally talks about legal access. So I can just briefly share some of the big themes

494
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,880
that came up.

495
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,720
Sure, yeah, and this was not your first conference, right?

496
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:49,600
This was actually my first conference. I had not attended the one, and I should clarify,

497
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:54,600
the conferences are every four years, so they're not very frequent, and that's part of why

498
00:43:54,600 --> 00:44:01,480
so many people showed up because there are quite a few psychedelic conferences around

499
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:08,920
the world that are happening all year and every year. In fact, just last fall, I attended

500
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,760
a psychedelic conference in Prague called Beyond Psychedelics. I attended one in New

501
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:19,280
York that happens every year called Horizons, and then I attended the second biannual IOWASCA,

502
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:24,420
World IOWASCA Conference, which was actually in Brazil and the Amazon. So there's a lot

503
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,920
of conferences happening, there's a lot of conversation happening, but psychedelic science

504
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:33,760
kind of stands in its own category, both because it's so big, it's literally thousands and

505
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,720
thousands of people, and also because MAPS has been in the game for so long because we,

506
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:44,120
as an organization, have been working in the space around psychedelic research and thus

507
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:52,640
policy for so long that we're seen as leaders in these conversations, which is why the really

508
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,960
big themes that came out over the course of the conference are not only relevant for us

509
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:02,200
at MAPS as we start to move forward in the process of beginning our Phase III MDMA research,

510
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:07,680
publishing more research that we've sponsored around Ibogaine and other substances, but

511
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:14,280
also for the movement more generally. So there are a few really, really big pieces, I think,

512
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:20,240
that are worth mentioning because you'll see them come up over and over in the conversation

513
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:27,080
around legal access to psychedelics and psychedelic research and therapy moving forward. One of

514
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,520
the first ones and one of the things that I think is really close to my heart is the

515
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:36,480
question of access. We kind of touched on this earlier, but there's this concern that

516
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:42,860
if and when, I'll say when, certain psychedelics become legally available for use for people

517
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:48,240
who have been diagnosed with certain disorders, whether it's PTSD or anxiety as a result

518
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:53,960
of the end of life, of their end of life or terminal illnesses or anxiety or addiction,

519
00:45:53,960 --> 00:46:02,320
whatever it is, opioid use disorder, there's this very real question that I think has been

520
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:06,480
relevant in the general medical community around access and I think will be particularly

521
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,400
important in the conversation on psychedelics. So when I say access, I mean that especially

522
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,960
in places like the United States where we have a healthcare system that, as I mentioned

523
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:19,480
earlier, leaves a lot of people behind that costs a tremendous amount of money that is

524
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,640
not accessible to every population, which means that quality healthcare, especially

525
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:29,360
mental healthcare, is severely inaccessible to a number of populations in the United States

526
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:35,320
and outside. One great example is that when most people think about PTSD, post-traumatic

527
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:40,160
stress disorder, they're thinking about people who have returned from war, who've returned

528
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:45,200
from a violent conflict, or for people who have survived physical or sexual assault.

529
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:51,000
And I think rightfully so because those populations are very real examples of people who've experienced

530
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,000
who have PTSD. The unfortunate reality, though, is that there's also tremendous populations

531
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:02,440
in the United States and otherwise that experience PTSD that are dramatically underdiagnosed.

532
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:06,120
And unless there's some sort of change in the way that we deal with mental healthcare

533
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:10,880
and deal with diagnosis and access to treatment, then we can legalize all the psychedelics

534
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,640
we want, but those people will still not get access to treatment. So one example is that

535
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:23,280
they've done studies where teenagers in parts of Atlanta, in inner-city Atlanta, experience

536
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,560
as high comparable or higher rates of PTSD than people who come from war. And that's

537
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:33,920
purely as a result of trauma from racial discrimination over the course of their lives. Similarly,

538
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,160
trans people experience trauma from being discriminated against from the process of

539
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:43,540
misgendering in the way that society has yet to properly understand how to deal with populations

540
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:48,020
that are non-binary, people who are non-binary, who have kind of different than the status

541
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:54,360
quo gender identities. So there's huge populations of people who experience constant trauma,

542
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:58,720
constant discrimination on a daily or almost daily basis for their whole lives, and often

543
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:03,040
for many generations who aren't diagnosed with PTSD because they don't really fit that

544
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:08,320
paradigm. So when we're thinking about access to psychedelics, a lot of people, myself included,

545
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:12,960
believe that we need to be talking not only about the logistics, like how do we get insurance

546
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:18,040
to cover MDMA when that becomes real? How do we get cannabis to be something that's

547
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:22,240
openly available for people with PTSD via the Veterans Administration? These big questions.

548
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:26,260
But also, what about the many people that the current medical system is leaving behind?

549
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:30,080
How can we include them in the conversation? And that will be a really interesting edge

550
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:35,440
moving forward because the psychedelic community in the United States and in many other places

551
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:40,120
is pretty white and pretty privileged and pretty much kind of fits the demographics

552
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:44,500
of people who you expect to be able to work in a space that's much riskier, that requires

553
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:48,360
much more privilege to be in comfortably. People with less privilege, with less access

554
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:52,920
to resources are much less likely to be in spaces and to be working in spaces where they

555
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:57,280
have to literally put their lives or their livelihoods at risk to be doing that kind

556
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,280
of work.

557
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,000
That's a very good point. Yeah.

558
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,680
Yeah. And I think that it's the same with people who are doing all kinds of advocacy.

559
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:09,000
It's like the people who are putting themselves on the line are often people who feel comfortable

560
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,440
enough where they don't feel at risk by being criminalized, of being kind of harmed by the

561
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,680
system. So it's up to those of us with that privilege and with that space who have it

562
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:26,080
right now to include those voices in our conversation until they're ready to show up themselves.

563
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:31,720
And I'm not saying that people from communities of color, gender non-binary communities aren't

564
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:35,560
showing up because they certainly are. They absolutely are. And they're putting their

565
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:39,640
voices in this conversation also. But we've got a lot of work to do if we're going to

566
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,000
be talking about long-term access.

567
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
So we have a lot of work to do on a social level first.

568
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:50,160
Exactly. Exactly. And that's the thing. This issue is not necessarily an issue about psychedelic

569
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:54,600
period. It's about access to medicine and access to healthcare, which is much broader

570
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:58,360
than just our work. But I think that for the psychedelic movement to move forward with

571
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:03,200
integrity, we should be including that conversation in the process of these other bigger conversations

572
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,400
that we're having.

573
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,520
So that's one. The other really big theme that I want to just discuss really quickly

574
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:12,120
is the question around... And these themes are somewhat linked, but the question around

575
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:18,560
not-for-profit versus for-profit drug development. The current medical system also is really

576
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:23,240
reliant on a for-profit pharmaceutical model, which not only has the problems that I just

577
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:29,520
described in this last little bit of the conversation, but also, frankly, is really expensive and

578
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:37,040
is very difficult to ensure that the actual process of developing these substances in

579
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,440
legal terms is available.

580
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,440
So I think that that's another big question that the movement will have to grapple with

581
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:47,680
and decide. Although MAPS, we were working on a hybrid, non-profit, for-profit model

582
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:55,560
with the MAPS Public Benefit Corporation. There's a diversity of perspectives around

583
00:50:55,560 --> 00:51:00,040
how we as a movement should be dealing with that and how we should be moving forward.

584
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,200
And that was another major theme.

585
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,320
And finally, just to wrap this thought up, the other big theme that came up a lot is

586
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:11,560
how the West and the North can be in right relation with Indigenous communities who've

587
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:16,240
offered us not only the substances that they've been using, whether they're plants or molecules

588
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:25,160
or whatever else, but also how we as a movement can be mindful of how we articulate access

589
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:31,480
to psychedelics in the long run. Because although there is a lot more attention, again, as you

590
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:36,600
mentioned, to these social issues, they will inevitably repeat themselves and they will

591
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:43,640
inevitably kind of be unearthed in this process of talking about medicine, especially because

592
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:51,600
psychedelics have this particular unique quality, even in their use, where they, like I said

593
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:57,640
earlier, kind of pull out all of the stuff that people try to keep down. And I think

594
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,880
dealing with that in the light will be really important with the movement moving forward.

595
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,400
And you saw a lot of that.

596
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,680
And actually, I should just add, I'm going really with some of the most critical big

597
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:12,040
issues, but the other big takeaway from the conference was that there's some amazing science

598
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:16,240
happening and that we're making a tremendous amount of progress. And I think that you and

599
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:20,280
your listeners should be on the lookout for a tremendous, tremendous amount of scientific

600
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:25,600
progress and evidence-based progress in the next two to four years, especially. In the

601
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,640
immediate future, we'll see a lot of really, really big research coming out around how

602
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:34,880
these substances induce mystical states or heightened states of consciousness or therapeutic

603
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:40,800
states or how different forms of use can have different positive impacts for a tremendous

604
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,120
number of populations.

605
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:47,160
So yeah, that's awesome. And I think that's a great way to conclude the conference by

606
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:52,120
talking about how much great work is being done by science, because I always have thought

607
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:56,320
that any challenge or any difficulty is an opportunity for something beautiful.

608
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,040
Absolutely. Absolutely.

609
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:02,440
Let me ask you the last question. I ask all my guests that if you come across an intelligent

610
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:07,560
alien from a different civilization, what would you say as the worst thing humanity

611
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,960
has done and what would you say as humanity's greatest achievement?

612
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:18,120
Ooh, that's a fantastic question. I think that the biggest sin, I guess I would say

613
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:22,320
I'm using that language sort of facetiously, but kind of not. The biggest sin that humanity

614
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:35,680
has committed has allowed itself and actually created systems that have promoted the separation

615
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:48,000
between us and the Earth and us and the stars. I think that our lack of empathy toward the

616
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:55,200
Earth and toward the literal home that we live on has translated into this deep lack

617
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:00,440
of empathy for each other. And I think a lot of the harms that we're seeing and the big

618
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:05,120
mistake I guess that I would say that I've seen that I think that we're really trying

619
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:13,120
to solve is this deep instinct that humanity has been trained and conditioned into that

620
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:18,040
there is an other. I think that's a big mistake to believe that there is an other, that we're

621
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:26,000
not all part of the same energetic ecological biological ecosystem. And I think that that

622
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,240
was a big mistake. And I think that the bigger mistake and the worst thing that we've done

623
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:36,400
is really turn what was maybe a mistake or something that happened as a result of a variety

624
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,800
of major social changes over the course of history and then weaponize that. And I think

625
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:46,240
turn that into something that now people make money off of and hurt other human beings off

626
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:54,720
of. I think that's one of the biggest tragedies that humanity has kind of unearthed in our

627
00:54:54,720 --> 00:55:02,240
own consciousness. I think the best thing, humanity has done some pretty amazing things.

628
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:07,000
I think that I have to give a lot of credit to like Indian food. I think Indian food is

629
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,400
one of the best things that humanity has done. But you know, I'm biased because I've got

630
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:19,920
Indian heritage. But no, but on a more serious note, I think that entire framework and process

631
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:24,920
of storytelling, and in particular, verbal storytelling, it's one of the reasons I love

632
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:28,960
doing podcasts and I got it's been fantastic talking to you because I think that the art

633
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:34,960
of verbal storytelling, like the art of oral communication, and not only like the information

634
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:39,920
that's contained in the that in those conversations and conversation and in storytelling, but

635
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:46,240
also all of the social and cultural kind of elements that go with storytelling with, you

636
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:52,100
know, the aspect of intergenerational learning, the aspect of articulating our experiences

637
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:56,360
for others to share the aspect of integrating challenging experiences, you know, whether

638
00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:00,560
it's with a psychedelic or because you went out into the forest and had a crazy experience

639
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:05,720
with like a bear, I don't know, like whatever, whatever the experience is, I think that developing

640
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:09,840
and cherishing the art of storytelling has been one of the most amazing things that humans

641
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:17,040
have done. And I really look forward to storytelling, you know, the simple act of sharing personal

642
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:23,280
experience as being one of the front and centerpieces of this movement for not just access to psychedelics,

643
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:51,720
but really access to a more empathetic and compassionate society moving forward.
