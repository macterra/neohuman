00:00.000 --> 00:05.080
You know, in the same mindset that it takes to believe that we need to make America great

00:05.080 --> 00:11.360
again, or we need to bring back these old policies because they have some sort of value

00:11.360 --> 00:18.200
that we've lost by changing, you know, by progressing our policies, that there's also

00:18.200 --> 00:24.020
this kind of nostalgia for a time where people, frankly, had less information, they knew less,

00:24.020 --> 00:36.320
they were less educated, and that's easier to manipulate and easier to control.

00:36.320 --> 00:40.200
Hello and welcome to the 38th episode of Neo Human Podcasts.

00:40.200 --> 00:45.680
I'm Aga Bahari at Agologist on Twitter and Instagram, and you can follow the show on

00:45.680 --> 00:49.680
LiveInLimbo.com, iTunes and YouTube.

00:49.680 --> 00:51.680
With me today, I have Ismail Ali.

00:51.680 --> 00:52.680
Welcome to the show, Ismail.

00:52.680 --> 00:53.680
Hi Aga.

00:53.680 --> 00:54.680
It's great to talk to you.

00:54.680 --> 00:55.680
Thank you for the invitation.

00:55.680 --> 00:56.680
I much appreciate it.

00:56.680 --> 00:57.680
My absolute pleasure.

00:57.680 --> 01:03.280
Why don't we start by hearing a little about your background, the work you've done, and

01:03.280 --> 01:06.680
what are you focusing on mainly now these days?

01:06.680 --> 01:07.680
Sure.

01:07.680 --> 01:11.520
Well, it's kind of hard to talk about the work that I do now without giving a little

01:11.520 --> 01:13.480
bit of kind of personal background.

01:13.480 --> 01:16.680
I'm the child of two immigrants.

01:16.680 --> 01:21.080
I was born and raised in California, but my father came from Pakistan and my mother came

01:21.080 --> 01:24.360
from Colombia in the 1980s.

01:24.360 --> 01:29.560
They both kind of left their respective countries as a result of either economic or political

01:29.560 --> 01:30.560
pressures.

01:30.560 --> 01:35.480
They both left their countries to the United States to avoid and to kind of ensure that

01:35.480 --> 01:42.040
their children, myself and my brothers, could avoid some of the political and economic conflict

01:42.040 --> 01:46.480
that they were experiencing in their home countries.

01:46.480 --> 01:51.440
The reason I bring that up is because so much of my own experience and so much of my own

01:51.440 --> 02:00.600
kind of political and personal professional route has been influenced by my own context

02:00.600 --> 02:07.000
and my own political context and my own awareness of how very real kind of political, economic,

02:07.000 --> 02:11.720
and other structural oppressions affect people like my family and myself and my community,

02:11.720 --> 02:15.400
but also the people around me and my friends and my allies and the people that I've seen

02:15.400 --> 02:16.920
in the world.

02:16.920 --> 02:25.680
So that just general framework really had me very aware of and interested in very complex

02:25.680 --> 02:33.680
political dynamics, especially around foreign policy and how the United States dealt with

02:33.680 --> 02:37.840
both foreign and domestic policy in the post 9-11 era.

02:37.840 --> 02:43.560
I was 11 years old when 9-11 happened and a lot of the response of the US government

02:43.560 --> 02:51.160
after 9-11 to Muslim communities in the United States, but also to people around the world,

02:51.160 --> 02:55.640
significantly influenced my own political leanings and I really saw or I felt like I

02:55.640 --> 03:03.080
saw very clearly the result of how different forms of oppression articulated themselves

03:03.080 --> 03:07.520
in different parts of the world and that led me really early to be really interested in

03:07.520 --> 03:13.720
issues of multiculturalism and kind of religious dialogue and intercultural dialogue, not only

03:13.720 --> 03:19.340
because I myself represented a combination of a variety of cultures, but also because

03:19.340 --> 03:27.080
I realized that there was so much of the suffering that I saw was a result of not just miscommunication

03:27.080 --> 03:35.240
but really this deep perception of misalignment between values that I think may not actually

03:35.240 --> 03:40.560
exist and are rather there because of these historical and long-term oppressions and structures

03:40.560 --> 03:44.800
that are built to maintain those structures, maintain those oppressive structures.

03:44.800 --> 03:50.480
So I've been really critical of kind of the status quo, the political status quo for many,

03:50.480 --> 03:51.480
many years.

03:51.480 --> 03:55.960
I was marching against the war in Iraq in 2002, even before it started when I was a

03:55.960 --> 04:00.240
really small child and spent most of my teenage years really critically kind of engaging with

04:00.240 --> 04:06.440
issues of foreign policy and domestic policy, which then led me really directly to very

04:06.440 --> 04:10.360
seriously critically engage with issues of mass incarceration and criminality in the

04:10.360 --> 04:12.160
United States.

04:12.160 --> 04:18.500
Over the course of my undergraduate and then my law school career, I focused a lot on civil

04:18.500 --> 04:24.380
liberties and civil rights and how they were protected or restricted by not only US but

04:24.380 --> 04:30.400
other governments and eventually kind of that brought me to a really acute awareness of

04:30.400 --> 04:36.160
the war on drugs and how the war on drugs has been this mechanism and this tool of not

04:36.160 --> 04:44.600
only criminal but also social control throughout the last few decades with the epicenter of

04:44.600 --> 04:46.900
that process being the United States.

04:46.900 --> 04:51.620
So that led me to work at the American Civil Liberties Union where I did some criminal

04:51.620 --> 04:59.360
justice reform work and I did some other policy work in 2015.

04:59.360 --> 05:02.880
In the year after that, I spent a lot of time researching human rights and really brought

05:02.880 --> 05:09.120
this general feeling of discomfort around the way governments treated their citizens

05:09.120 --> 05:14.680
to a more kind of theoretical place where I was really trying to connect the oppressions

05:14.680 --> 05:18.680
that I was seeing with and hopefully the solutions for those oppressions I was seeing to these

05:18.680 --> 05:23.760
larger concepts which I later discovered were really well articulated in the international

05:23.760 --> 05:32.120
scheme for human rights and that all led me to really thinking critically about access

05:32.120 --> 05:38.240
to healing and the role of healing in change over time and changing these structures and

05:38.240 --> 05:44.360
that kind of dovetailed really directly and really easily into what became the work that

05:44.360 --> 05:50.680
I do now which is essentially political and policy advocacy work for the Multidisciplinary

05:50.680 --> 05:56.800
Association for Psychedelic Studies which it was formed as a research organization to

05:56.800 --> 06:03.000
kind of bring MDMA in particular out of the illegal criminal context that it was placed

06:03.000 --> 06:13.020
in in the mid-80s into a legal medical framework and I'm now seeing this shift from focusing

06:13.020 --> 06:20.800
primarily and only on research as a method of change in education into a greater expansion

06:20.800 --> 06:26.040
into connecting these issues of access to healing, of access to medicine, to not only

06:26.040 --> 06:34.320
issues that challenge the framework of the drug war but also really align it with these

06:34.320 --> 06:40.280
bigger values that I've been thinking about for so long like human rights and social justice.

06:40.280 --> 06:46.560
That's amazing. You obviously have had some experiences with psychedelics yourself, right?

06:46.560 --> 06:48.120
Yes, I have.

06:48.120 --> 06:54.040
Yeah, and so have I. I'll give you a little bit of background about myself. I came from

06:54.040 --> 07:01.160
Iran as a refugee and I was in love with America all my life. That was the goal to make it

07:01.160 --> 07:08.400
to America because everything that was good was coming from America and all the pressure

07:08.400 --> 07:13.580
and all the difficulties and all the complexity that I had to deal with as a child and growing

07:13.580 --> 07:21.240
up in that environment. I tried to seek help in different ways from talking to psychologists

07:21.240 --> 07:28.280
and gurus and mentors and life coaches and stuff and then I ended up trying psilocybin

07:28.280 --> 07:36.920
mushrooms in Vancouver, BC and that was life-changing experience for me because for me it brought

07:36.920 --> 07:43.560
out everything that I had in my mind and articulated in a very emotional way that I'm sure you

07:43.560 --> 07:47.640
know what I'm talking about but it's kind of difficult to describe it to people who

07:47.640 --> 07:56.080
haven't tried it and it really was life-changing for the best. I stayed with it not like doing

07:56.080 --> 08:03.120
it all the time but with psychedelics you cannot do it all the time. You take two, three

08:03.120 --> 08:07.840
grams of mushrooms and the lessons that you've learned you have to process for the next week

08:07.840 --> 08:13.680
or two but what's interesting to me about you is that do you find any political organizations

08:13.680 --> 08:19.320
in today's America that you can affiliate with because I don't hear that much of a pro

08:19.320 --> 08:24.600
drug overall, a pro psychedelic narration from either of the parties.

08:24.600 --> 08:28.960
So I want to comment on a couple of things you said before answering that question because

08:28.960 --> 08:32.420
you just brought up a lot of really, really interesting concepts and I just pulled up

08:32.420 --> 08:39.680
a study that the Guardian just reported on. This study came out really recently, we had

08:39.680 --> 08:44.480
last Wednesday that found that mushrooms are actually the safest recreational drug and

08:44.480 --> 08:50.280
they just did a really big study where they looked at who sought medical treatment after

08:50.280 --> 08:55.120
using a variety of different drugs like MDMA, LSD, cocaine, cannabis. They found that one

08:55.120 --> 08:59.680
of the riskiest drugs was synthetic cannabis which is really interesting because synthetic

08:59.680 --> 09:04.080
cannabis is primarily used by people who are getting drug test and who can't use real cannabis

09:04.080 --> 09:08.480
so it's primarily a function of the prohibition of cannabis that synthetic cannabis is even

09:08.480 --> 09:12.600
a thing and second they found that people who took mushrooms, I mean this is all the

09:12.600 --> 09:17.720
study occurred over the course of 2016 but they said that out of 12,000 people who were

09:17.720 --> 09:23.480
reported taking psilocybin mushrooms, 0.2% needed emergency medical treatment which is

09:23.480 --> 09:30.360
five times lower than that of MDMA, LSD, and cocaine. It's just funny that you say that

09:30.360 --> 09:35.000
specifically because there's now increasing evidence that magic mushrooms, in particular

09:35.000 --> 09:44.720
psilocybin in particular, is one of the safest drugs in the world and the unfortunate reality

09:44.720 --> 09:51.720
is that most people who have bad experiences is people who pick their own mushrooms and

09:51.720 --> 09:57.440
eat the wrong mushrooms that are toxic rather than psychedelic. It's interesting that you

09:57.440 --> 10:01.280
bring up your experience with psilocybin because I too had an experience with psilocybin when

10:01.280 --> 10:08.680
I was young that really significantly changed my own perception around my own political

10:08.680 --> 10:12.900
kind of state and my own understanding of my role in the world that I think has had

10:12.900 --> 10:16.920
a tremendous impact on the work that I've been doing. I just wanted to comment on that

10:16.920 --> 10:20.440
before going on because it's an interesting parallel and something I very much resonate

10:20.440 --> 10:24.200
with and I think a lot of other people resonate with too. Even though I hear what you mean

10:24.200 --> 10:28.960
that talking about it to people who have an experience can be challenging, it's also true

10:28.960 --> 10:39.680
that for many people who have, whether they're in the West or not, the kind of enduring universality

10:39.680 --> 10:43.760
of the experience is something that a lot of people share.

10:43.760 --> 10:48.920
Going to your question around political affiliations, it's interesting that you ask that because

10:48.920 --> 10:55.560
first and foremost, there haven't been that many organizations, well there really are

10:55.560 --> 11:01.760
very few organizations that are actively open about being, as you say, pro-drug users and

11:01.760 --> 11:07.400
supporting specific use of specific substances. It's actually kind of funny, the first time

11:07.400 --> 11:11.640
that I had a conversation with the Drug Policy Alliance a few years ago, they're now one

11:11.640 --> 11:15.640
of our big allies at MAPS. We work a lot with the Drug Policy Alliance and we support their

11:15.640 --> 11:22.960
work a lot. They focus a lot on harm reduction, they've done a lot of work on mass incarceration

11:22.960 --> 11:29.060
and cannabis laws, but one of the first questions I had for them was, I wonder what is it that's

11:29.060 --> 11:35.460
preventing you from being pro-drug use, being open to not only minimizing the harms but

11:35.460 --> 11:39.240
also recognizing some of the benefits?

11:39.240 --> 11:43.880
The response, which I think was very reasonable, is that at this point in time, this was a

11:43.880 --> 11:48.600
few years ago, not only was there not necessarily enough evidence to say, well, anyone should

11:48.600 --> 11:57.480
be coming out in favor of drug use, whatever that means, but also that we hadn't yet fully

11:57.480 --> 12:02.120
explored the nuances of what we meant by drug use, whether it's in psychedelic or other

12:02.120 --> 12:10.720
contexts. So much of the conversation generally, and this is true also in political spaces

12:10.720 --> 12:16.460
with respect to people who are responding to the war on drugs, is based on what people

12:16.460 --> 12:20.760
perceive as much more urgent needs, so dealing with harm reduction from injection drug users

12:20.760 --> 12:25.280
and ensuring that people who take substances are taking them in settings that are safe

12:25.280 --> 12:32.320
and that have the auxiliary support necessary for people who have challenging experiences,

12:32.320 --> 12:37.640
whether it's with a psychedelic or another substance. So we at MAPS are really cautious

12:37.640 --> 12:45.600
because although our work has really focused primarily on research and because we've published

12:45.600 --> 12:50.240
quite a bit of really impressive research, especially with respect to the studies that

12:50.240 --> 12:56.200
we've conducted ourselves about MDMA for PTSD, it's also true that we've sponsored

12:56.200 --> 13:01.200
and worked with other organizations to study other things like Ibogaine and like Ayahuasca,

13:01.200 --> 13:07.600
both of which have a very different profile of use, a different cultural context, a different

13:07.600 --> 13:12.960
kind of framework of use that almost places them, that some people believe places them

13:12.960 --> 13:20.080
in a different category than something like MDMA or even LSD or heroin or cocaine. So

13:20.080 --> 13:24.760
to kind of loop back around and really answer your question, one of the things that we're

13:24.760 --> 13:27.840
trying to do at MAPS and that I personally have really been spending a lot of time and

13:27.840 --> 13:32.480
effort to work in, along with my colleague and supervisor, Natalie Ginsburg, who's the

13:32.480 --> 13:37.920
Policy and Advocacy Manager at MAPS, is really kind of figuring out what that space looks

13:37.920 --> 13:44.560
like. What does it really mean to advocate for this, not just for more research, but

13:44.560 --> 13:52.680
also for access to these substances? MAPS' goal is to create legal, safe and legal context

13:52.680 --> 13:58.040
for the medical, cultural, and therapeutic use of these substances. And in order to have

13:58.040 --> 14:05.040
those structures, we need to have a clear understanding of our identity, both as advocates

14:05.040 --> 14:11.360
and as people within the movement of access to the substances. Just to finish this thought,

14:11.360 --> 14:17.960
I think one of the biggest mistakes that people made in the 1960s was, you know, really increase

14:17.960 --> 14:24.360
discussions around access to the substances, but did not bring with it the structures within

14:24.360 --> 14:30.880
which those substances could be safely done. Education. Exactly. And also, I think one

14:30.880 --> 14:38.320
big piece of it is also, one great example is that a number of indigenous cultures, including

14:38.320 --> 14:42.600
ones who've used ayahuasca and iboga and a number of other substances, have been using

14:42.600 --> 14:46.360
psychedelic substances for years and years and years in a variety of contexts with little

14:46.360 --> 14:51.160
to no negative consequences. And that's partially because they have these systems in place,

14:51.160 --> 14:57.320
not just education, but also these like really large, complex social systems that allow

14:57.320 --> 15:03.120
people to be both educated and then well supported in the process of taking the substance and

15:03.120 --> 15:07.120
afterward. And that just didn't exist in the 1960s. We kind of got access to LSD and

15:07.120 --> 15:10.280
mushrooms and then imploded. You know, there really wasn't that structure that needed

15:10.280 --> 15:15.400
to happen. And that's what we're trying to do now is create that structure. Education

15:15.400 --> 15:22.280
in the broader sense is what I mean that, because to me, it seems like all the conclusions

15:22.280 --> 15:27.920
that are needed in order to policies being built upon them are non-existent now because

15:27.920 --> 15:32.720
we can't even have a conversation without being completely rejected. You know, you can't

15:32.720 --> 15:39.680
talk about ayahuasca and LSD and mushrooms and not being compared to cocaine and meth

15:39.680 --> 15:48.840
and crack and you know, it's just a very alienated subject that majority of people, even if they

15:48.840 --> 15:54.640
don't want to deal with it themselves, they automatically and by default, they're defensive

15:54.640 --> 16:01.040
towards it. Absolutely. Absolutely. And you know, even you know, as drug policy advocates,

16:01.040 --> 16:07.040
because although you know, I and my colleagues work with psychedelics primarily, we're also

16:07.040 --> 16:10.480
you know, at the end of the day, we're also drug policy and criminal justice reform advocates

16:10.480 --> 16:16.280
because the issue is not only just the structure, but it's also the fact that the current scheme

16:16.280 --> 16:20.720
criminalizes the behavior, which makes any sort of safe structured use that much more

16:20.720 --> 16:27.840
difficult. So we're very cautious to avoid throwing other drugs under the bus because

16:27.840 --> 16:31.640
we really do believe in compassionate responses to people who use any substance, you know,

16:31.640 --> 16:37.080
whether it's heroin, whether it's meth, whether it's mushrooms, but also recognizing that

16:37.080 --> 16:43.720
there, there, there has been this kind of like unfortunate kind of blanket stigma attached

16:43.720 --> 16:50.160
to any sort of mind altering substance, which is simply put like kind of an uneducated and

16:50.160 --> 16:55.160
unevident response that isn't based in evidence, excuse me, that's what I'm trying to say,

16:55.160 --> 17:02.800
but it's based much more on those initial miseducation or fear based responses that

17:02.800 --> 17:08.360
were really promoted by a variety of past past administrations, presidents, governments,

17:08.360 --> 17:14.320
whatever that has kind of set into the public conversation that like exactly as you said,

17:14.320 --> 17:17.680
if we're going to be talking about these substances, we have to be talking to them in the context

17:17.680 --> 17:21.600
of the harms and the toxins and the bad things that they do, which kind of goes back to your

17:21.600 --> 17:25.080
early question, it's like, well, we're now getting, you know, this is the big change

17:25.080 --> 17:29.320
that's happening right now in the midst of what people are calling this psychedelic renaissance,

17:29.320 --> 17:38.400
which is that, well, we now are getting clinical evidence of, of, of facts that people have

17:38.400 --> 17:42.640
have speculated about and suspected for years and years and years, you know, people in the

17:42.640 --> 17:46.280
West have been speculating for decades now and for, for indigenous communities, you've

17:46.280 --> 17:51.120
been working with some of these substances for literally centuries, if not longer. And

17:51.120 --> 17:56.120
we're finally starting to get to a point where talking about these structures, these regulatory

17:56.120 --> 18:02.560
structures is simply put no longer, you know, theoretical pie in the sky woo woo nonsense,

18:02.560 --> 18:08.800
because we really need to start thinking seriously about, you know, if, if we, if maps will have

18:08.800 --> 18:13.560
gone through the FDA approval process, you know, there's a simultaneous, the same simultaneous

18:13.560 --> 18:17.160
process for psilocybin research in the United States. It's also going through the FDA approval

18:17.160 --> 18:23.720
process. If in five years, we have legal prescription access to either both of these substances

18:23.720 --> 18:29.520
in specific cases for specific people, we need to know how to do it. We can't pretend

18:29.520 --> 18:33.400
like we, we already have this, the solutions or the structures because we don't. And we

18:33.400 --> 18:38.400
also can't pretend that, you know, any conversation about them isn't relevant because they are.

18:38.400 --> 18:41.520
We're now at a point where we really need to be seriously thinking about like, well,

18:41.520 --> 18:45.480
what, you know, who's funding it, who's getting access to it, how is insurance dealing with

18:45.480 --> 18:50.520
these are questions that are very relevant for other issues of, you know, of kind of

18:50.520 --> 18:55.800
medical treatments that just aren't at all live yet in the world of psychedelics, just

18:55.800 --> 19:01.120
because we're still kind of working to get taken seriously by the rest of, by the rest

19:01.120 --> 19:05.720
of, uh, by the rest of the people who haven't caught on yet. I'll say that we're definitely

19:05.720 --> 19:09.400
getting taken seriously and rightfully so by a number of people because the evidence

19:09.400 --> 19:13.880
is just coming out and it's just so good. But, you know, there's still a lot of that,

19:13.880 --> 19:18.840
that stigma to, to, to counteract. That's very true. Um, what is the current state of

19:18.840 --> 19:25.560
war on drugs? Because we were getting very close to have a general conversation about

19:25.560 --> 19:30.640
legalization of marijuana all across the U S and here in Canada. And then Trump administration

19:30.640 --> 19:37.080
happened and Jeff session and all of that. So how, how are we doing now? That's a really

19:37.080 --> 19:41.800
good question. And it's, you know, I, I'm going to give an answer, but I can tell you

19:41.800 --> 19:49.320
that I have yet to hear anything very secure. And that's not because people, anyone knows

19:49.320 --> 19:53.680
more or less than the other, but because there's so much chaos occurring in the current administration

19:53.680 --> 20:00.440
in the United States that it's kind of unclear how the power dynamics will shake out. And

20:00.440 --> 20:03.800
as a result, you know, just practically speaking, we at maps are being very, you know, we're

20:03.800 --> 20:06.940
treading pretty cautiously because what we want to make sure that we have some clarity

20:06.940 --> 20:11.200
with respect to how the federal government will be dealing with, you know, moving forward

20:11.200 --> 20:17.320
on the war on drugs before we start making any big moves. I will say that from our perspective

20:17.320 --> 20:21.880
at maps, the, the research that we're doing is still going to go forward. The studies

20:21.880 --> 20:25.240
that we're working on will still continue. We, we're not planning on making any dramatic

20:25.240 --> 20:30.960
changes to the work that we do based on this, on this shift in part because we work so closely

20:30.960 --> 20:36.080
with the FDA and because the FDA has been so supportive and accommodating of the process

20:36.080 --> 20:41.360
of this research because, you know, they, they're at least, you know, in, to the extent

20:41.360 --> 20:43.680
of, to the extent of the amount that they've worked with us, really interested in figuring

20:43.680 --> 20:48.040
out the truth behind the legitimacy of these substances. And the only way you can do that

20:48.040 --> 20:52.560
is with, you know, rigorous scientific evaluation, which is exactly what we're doing. But more

20:52.560 --> 20:58.360
generally on the question of the war on drugs, I have to say that there, there's kind of

20:58.360 --> 21:01.920
mixed feelings in the drug policy community about, there's a solid percentage of people,

21:01.920 --> 21:07.760
myself included, that are, I think, rightfully skeptical because people like Jeff Sessions

21:07.760 --> 21:11.440
and others who are kind of coming, it's kind of like a blast from the past. You know, a

21:11.440 --> 21:15.760
lot of people are really seeing it as this attempt of the crit administration to go back

21:15.760 --> 21:22.160
to fifties fifties, if that right. Like I've been, you know, you look at some of the rhetoric

21:22.160 --> 21:26.280
and it's not, it's not so far off of the rhetoric that you hear, that you heard in like even

21:26.280 --> 21:31.840
like the thirties when they were first attempting to criminalize cannabis. And generally speaking

21:31.840 --> 21:35.720
going backwards is not a good idea, but going back to those particular areas, I think is

21:35.720 --> 21:40.160
the, is particularly dangerous because that's where, you know, that, that was the origin

21:40.160 --> 21:44.820
of a lot of the rhetoric and a lot of the behavior that we now see articulated in these

21:44.820 --> 21:49.160
extremely high rates of incarceration for, for black and brown Americans and for poor

21:49.160 --> 21:55.960
people all over the United States and in other places. So, um, I, I'm, I'm a perma optimist.

21:55.960 --> 22:00.960
I always, I'm trying to look at the bright side and I have to say that as, as scary as

22:00.960 --> 22:06.040
it is, and as much as, as much as it's true that a number of people will be very rapidly

22:06.040 --> 22:11.520
and dramatically negatively affected by this attempt to return to these kind of like old

22:11.520 --> 22:18.000
outdated beliefs that, you know, incarcerating more people and finding and doing more kind

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
of increasing criminality is a good thing, which, which I think so much research and

22:22.000 --> 22:26.840
so much of our experience has proven otherwise. Um, I do believe that what's happening right

22:26.840 --> 22:31.000
now in the United States, especially, but this is true around the world, it's kind of

22:31.000 --> 22:37.120
this, um, unearthing of this shadow that, that has kind of been lurking in American

22:37.120 --> 22:41.240
culture for a really long time. You know, the thing about the Korean administration

22:41.240 --> 22:46.320
is that we're not really seeing, especially for those of us who've spent many years, myself

22:46.320 --> 22:51.360
and we've spent many years being really critical of the American political establishment, you

22:51.360 --> 22:55.200
know, what we're seeing is not exactly a surprise, you know, where I'm not, you know, a lot of

22:55.200 --> 23:00.880
us are not necessarily surprised that, you know, people can be this bad or can be this

23:00.880 --> 23:05.520
kind of reactionary. It's mostly scary to see the kind of public support that's coming

23:05.520 --> 23:09.200
out in favor of it. And I think that that process, and again, this is the optimist in

23:09.200 --> 23:13.400
me, maybe it's night and maybe being night, but I do think it's just optimism that what

23:13.400 --> 23:17.600
we kind of need to go through this process of seeing how bad things really are before

23:17.600 --> 23:22.120
we can properly deal with probably deal with solutions. And ironically, that makes it kind

23:22.120 --> 23:26.680
of like a psychedelic experience where, you know, you got to deal with some of the bad,

23:26.680 --> 23:33.320
like the bad, traumatic, intense, challenging things before you can get to healing. And

23:33.320 --> 23:36.440
I think what's happening right now with both the war on drugs and just generally in the

23:36.440 --> 23:41.320
United States is this process of really unearthing all of that trauma that people have tried

23:41.320 --> 23:47.600
and failed to, you know, keep in the ground. And I think that this is really how we can

23:47.600 --> 23:51.160
really understand what are the real problems and what are the solutions? How do we actually

23:51.160 --> 23:52.160
deal with it?

23:52.160 --> 23:58.760
Yeah, well, it's clearly a subject interesting to large group of people. And it's not like

23:58.760 --> 24:03.840
war on drugs or tougher policies are going to stop them. All it had done is just empowered

24:03.840 --> 24:10.460
people in the black market, whether in this reality or internet and darknet to, you know,

24:10.460 --> 24:15.400
buy anything they want with Bitcoin. I know people who have done that. It's not it's not

24:15.400 --> 24:20.020
a very hard thing to do. You can do it really easily. But what you're saying is very true.

24:20.020 --> 24:24.840
We don't really know the risks and we don't really know the full potential that we can

24:24.840 --> 24:30.600
get from these drugs to help each other and help the world. Because the connectivity of

24:30.600 --> 24:36.000
it is is is an interesting aspect to that how internet is connecting us with each other,

24:36.000 --> 24:40.800
the sense of how we're connected to everything else when we're doing psychedelics. It seems

24:40.800 --> 24:47.560
to be something that politicians are trying to avoid to face, right? So do you think ideologically,

24:47.560 --> 24:52.580
they also have something against it that, hey, if you do mushrooms and LSD, you realize

24:52.580 --> 24:59.120
that Jeff Sessions or Trump or Clinton or none of those people are really addressing

24:59.120 --> 25:02.880
the real issues that you have to deal with on a personal level?

25:02.880 --> 25:08.840
Absolutely. So it's it's funny that you mentioned the internet because I think that what I think

25:08.840 --> 25:13.520
I'm calling the internetification of the world, which is just this interesting kind of like

25:13.520 --> 25:17.920
rapid connectivity, which, as you say, is like a total game changer for society. I think

25:17.920 --> 25:24.280
that we can I think that you can kind of see some sort of analogy between the fight for

25:24.280 --> 25:32.440
net neutrality and access information like free accessible information that that parallels

25:32.440 --> 25:37.760
what we're seeing with access to other kinds of knowledge technologies, including psychedelics.

25:37.760 --> 25:42.360
I think that, you know, I try not to be a cynic, but at the at the at the end of the

25:42.360 --> 25:50.040
day, when I see, you know, repeated attempts by politicians and others to restrict access

25:50.040 --> 25:56.720
to information, which is really like the one of the most unifying things about being about

25:56.720 --> 26:02.040
a human society, which is this increase in access to education and access to information,

26:02.040 --> 26:08.280
which is such a crucial piece of liberation, both in a physical and physical, literal and

26:08.280 --> 26:15.880
a mental kind of paradigm. The I can't help but wonder what, as you say, like what what

26:15.880 --> 26:20.920
are the what is motivating these people to be so reactionary and frightened about it?

26:20.920 --> 26:26.080
I think that we can get some of that information by looking at how exactly, you know, drug

26:26.080 --> 26:31.560
control systems, especially like control systems for psychedelics, were kind of originated

26:31.560 --> 26:39.440
in the late 60s and early 70s as a response to not only this really, really vibrant youth

26:39.440 --> 26:44.480
led antiwar movement, but also this dramatic societal shift that was kind of this backlash

26:44.480 --> 26:51.880
from what people saw as this idyllic American dream that was kind of created in the 1950s.

26:51.880 --> 26:57.960
And I believe that, you know, that in the same, you know, in the same mindset that it

26:57.960 --> 27:05.400
takes to believe that we need to make America great again, or we need to bring back these

27:05.400 --> 27:10.680
old policies because they have some sort of value that we've lost by changing, you know,

27:10.680 --> 27:16.800
by progressing our policies, that there's also this kind of nostalgia for a time where

27:16.800 --> 27:22.560
people frankly had less information, they knew less, they were less educated, and that's

27:22.560 --> 27:30.680
easier to manipulate and easier to control. I don't necessarily believe that the current,

27:30.680 --> 27:36.880
the current, you know, continuation of criminality around psychedelics in particular is directly

27:36.880 --> 27:41.680
related to this giant malicious structure that wants to keep people kind of keep people

27:41.680 --> 27:48.640
in their own kind of spaces, intellectual spaces. But I do believe that there is a fear

27:48.640 --> 27:54.680
that having access to these altered mind states could result in, you know, exactly the thing

27:54.680 --> 27:59.520
that people were afraid of, which people saw having in the 1960s, which is anti authoritarianism

27:59.520 --> 28:04.520
or behavior that's seen as being misaligned with the social order. I think the big mistake

28:04.520 --> 28:09.120
there is that, A, well, there's two, I think there's two big mistakes with that. The first

28:09.120 --> 28:14.040
being assuming that the current social order works for everyone, which is simply not the

28:14.040 --> 28:19.520
case. It marginalizes and leaves behind full populations of people, Black Americans, Americans

28:19.520 --> 28:26.000
of color, people of color around the world, people in countries that are currently being

28:26.000 --> 28:33.240
directly targeted by the American Warfare Machine, people in the Global South who are

28:33.240 --> 28:37.560
victims of the exploitation of the North and of the West. You know, there's all these populations

28:37.560 --> 28:42.880
that are being left behind by the status quo. So that premise that the status quo works

28:42.880 --> 28:47.880
and should be promoted right there from the beginning is flawed. And then on top of that,

28:47.880 --> 28:53.360
the impression is that there isn't any value that can come out of this use. And I'm not

28:53.360 --> 28:59.840
just talking about medically and therapeutically, but I mean from a broader interpersonal and

28:59.840 --> 29:04.080
social perspective, which I think is another big mistake. I think that part of what's coming

29:04.080 --> 29:08.880
out of this movement toward access to psychedelics, whether it's for medicine or for sacrament

29:08.880 --> 29:16.240
or for personal development, kind of goes back to what you were saying earlier around

29:16.240 --> 29:23.040
what exactly are the benefits here? And I think part of those benefits include a willingness

29:23.040 --> 29:29.800
to recognize that restructuring certain aspects of society would not just be better for these

29:29.800 --> 29:34.440
marginalized populations that I mentioned, but also just better for everybody because

29:34.440 --> 29:40.560
we've tried systems that have clearly failed to work and that maybe finding alternatives,

29:40.560 --> 29:44.840
whether it's with the help of personal development or personal work through use of psychedelics

29:44.840 --> 29:49.440
or sacred medicine or whatever else or some other method. I'm not claiming that taking

29:49.440 --> 29:53.320
mushrooms is like the way we're going to create the new society, but I do believe that there

29:53.320 --> 29:57.480
is ought to be said for the kind of mind state that psychedelics can promote and how that

29:57.480 --> 30:02.560
creative open space can be really, really positive, can result in positive outcomes

30:02.560 --> 30:10.080
for this longer term development and creation of not just alternative, but more articulated,

30:10.080 --> 30:12.080
more honest and more free societies.

30:12.080 --> 30:17.400
Absolutely. And I just want to add to that a part of your introduction, a MAPS website

30:17.400 --> 30:22.520
that says that you believe that psychedelic consciousness is crucial piece of challenging

30:22.520 --> 30:28.080
oppression in all of its form and the legal access to psychedelics is an essential part

30:28.080 --> 30:30.280
of a progressive drug policy paradigm.

30:30.280 --> 30:31.280
Absolutely. Yeah.

30:31.280 --> 30:35.560
So it's very important. And what's interesting to me is that a lot of the negative narrative

30:35.560 --> 30:44.440
is coming from the religious side. And yet Jesus himself was one of the most famous activists

30:44.440 --> 30:52.240
against the status quo. And at the same time, the religious experiences that certain people

30:52.240 --> 30:56.400
have on psychedelics, there are a lot of studies that shows maybe Moses, for example, had a

30:56.400 --> 30:58.560
psychedelic experience as well.

30:58.560 --> 31:05.840
Absolutely. I think it's very interesting that a lot of the people who are a lot of

31:05.840 --> 31:11.800
the characters that have been kind of touted as being spiritual leaders, the Prophet Muhammad

31:11.800 --> 31:16.480
in Islam, Jesus, Buddha, a lot of these characters are pretty psychedelic figures in the sense

31:16.480 --> 31:22.640
that if you read about their lives and what they've done, they have this, one of the most

31:22.640 --> 31:32.520
universal characteristics of really very influential religious leaders is this deep generosity

31:32.520 --> 31:40.520
and this deep willingness to be open to compassion to others, in particular people who are suffering.

31:40.520 --> 31:44.280
And I know plenty of people who I know, I know plenty of people who've taken psychedelics

31:44.280 --> 31:48.320
and who haven't necessarily developed that. So I don't want to, you know, again, act like

31:48.320 --> 31:50.620
these are silver bullets.

31:50.620 --> 31:56.520
That said, there is no doubt in my mind that for many, many people, myself included, maybe

31:56.520 --> 32:01.520
for you, for a lot of others, access to psychedelic spaces, and this is kind of what the comment

32:01.520 --> 32:05.600
in my bio is about, access to that kind of psychedelic state of mind and psychedelic

32:05.600 --> 32:10.560
really just being a proxy here for an open and articulated frame, open, creative and

32:10.560 --> 32:16.880
articulated frame of mind. It is one of the most enduring characteristics of what people

32:16.880 --> 32:23.760
see as deeply mystical, if not deeply mystical and often spiritual beliefs, which lead to

32:23.760 --> 32:28.160
religious structures. The commentary that you're making is really interesting. So I

32:28.160 --> 32:34.340
was actually, I was raised Muslim. My mother was Catholic. My father was Muslim. My mother

32:34.340 --> 32:38.560
converted to Islam later in my life and I was raised Muslim. I still identify as Muslim

32:38.560 --> 32:43.560
and I've been thinking a lot about the intersection between the mystical experience, both in Sufi

32:43.560 --> 32:48.880
Islam and also in other faiths and in the psychedelic experience and in how there is

32:48.880 --> 32:53.720
so much that I think that modern religious structure can learn from the freedom and the

32:53.720 --> 32:58.680
openness of the psychedelic experience. And frankly, although I'm personally very critical

32:58.680 --> 33:02.400
of a lot of the way that institutionalized religion has been articulated, especially

33:02.400 --> 33:07.720
politically in the world today, I do believe that the psychedelic world can learn a lot

33:07.720 --> 33:14.360
from how indigenous structure, indigenous cultures and other long-standing religious

33:14.360 --> 33:21.760
and spiritual traditions have held that space and have created containers where not only

33:21.760 --> 33:28.800
the experiences can be had, but also that the maximum benefit of something like mysticism

33:28.800 --> 33:34.560
or the mystical experiences that come out of psychedelic experiences can be best articulated

33:34.560 --> 33:40.640
not only in the individual who takes it, but also in their personal relationships and in

33:40.640 --> 33:50.040
a larger sense in society. One of the most amazing gifts I think that indigenous sacred

33:50.040 --> 33:55.120
plant medicine use has that I think that the West and the general psychedelic culture could

33:55.120 --> 34:04.160
learn a lot from is the use of rites of passage and initiations. I think that we as people

34:04.160 --> 34:07.800
who are experimenting with our minds in a variety of contexts, whether we identify as

34:07.800 --> 34:13.120
psychonauts or whatever else, are kind of seeking out that initiation, seeking out those

34:13.120 --> 34:17.000
mystical experiences, or else we wouldn't be called to eat like a random mushroom that

34:17.000 --> 34:23.880
we heard. There's this kind of like deep courage and curiosity in people who seek access to

34:23.880 --> 34:29.280
psychedelic spaces because they kind of have, whether it's conscious or not, they have

34:29.280 --> 34:35.600
found and we have found this alignment between this deep spiritual seeking and this state

34:35.600 --> 34:39.840
that some of these substances are able to promote. And I think that that's where kind

34:39.840 --> 34:43.840
of getting to your point around where the opposition lies. I think that that can be

34:43.840 --> 34:50.200
seen as a threat for traditional religious structures. And I recognize that direct access

34:50.200 --> 34:56.800
to divinity or to mysticism can be threatening to structures that require mediums or require

34:56.800 --> 35:02.280
some sort of buffer between divinity or God or great spirit or whatever.

35:02.280 --> 35:03.280
Middle man.

35:03.280 --> 35:09.160
Exactly. Exactly. Some sort of middle structure. I think that psychedelics really totally obliterate

35:09.160 --> 35:13.360
that middle structure and show every person that they can have a direct connection to

35:13.360 --> 35:16.800
whatever that larger power is, which is kind of scary for some people.

35:16.800 --> 35:22.520
Yeah. I think the problem actually is shared between organized religions, certain organized

35:22.520 --> 35:29.600
religions and nation states that they don't want to lose the exclusive access to knowledge

35:29.600 --> 35:32.680
and information that they've held for hundreds of years.

35:32.680 --> 35:33.680
Definitely.

35:33.680 --> 35:39.400
Yeah. And I don't really know how it's going to conclude itself. I think people like you

35:39.400 --> 35:45.260
are heroes. I think you're doing the greatest work that anybody can do because you guys

35:45.260 --> 35:51.000
are not giving people fish. You're teaching people how to fish in the best possible way.

35:51.000 --> 35:56.920
That is, take that medicine and learn about yourself and learn about your surrounding

35:56.920 --> 36:01.280
and learn about your environment from your perspective because it really gets to, we

36:01.280 --> 36:06.960
talk a lot about artificial intelligence on this show and how we're getting to the point

36:06.960 --> 36:14.240
that we have to address core characteristics of what makes us human. Is it ethics and morality?

36:14.240 --> 36:19.160
But not many of them are objective like laws of physics. These are our subjective perspective

36:19.160 --> 36:23.440
dependent and psychedelic seems to be the best tool to discover that.

36:23.440 --> 36:28.880
Yeah. Well, I first want to say, I really appreciate you saying that because I feel

36:28.880 --> 36:31.360
very deeply honored to be doing this work.

36:31.360 --> 36:35.720
I really do think so. It's not an easy thing to do and it's potentially dangerous work

36:35.720 --> 36:36.720
to do.

36:36.720 --> 36:43.260
Yeah. And I am looking forward to the day that, you know, it's not just a handful of

36:43.260 --> 36:47.120
us that are like kind of putting ourselves on the front lines to do this because not

36:47.120 --> 36:51.120
only is it like, just from a professional perspective, it's such an interesting space

36:51.120 --> 36:56.400
to be in, to be on the cutting edge of these kind of kind of big social changes. But also

36:56.400 --> 37:01.240
as you say, like, you know, we need a lot of input from a lot of people. There's a lot

37:01.240 --> 37:06.560
of communities that have been left behind in the process of nation state building and

37:06.560 --> 37:10.840
knowledge structuring and access to information that have been left out of the conversation.

37:10.840 --> 37:13.960
And I think the only way that we're going to be able to create a society in the long

37:13.960 --> 37:21.640
run that really truly is, you know, does avoid the repeated oppression that you and I have

37:21.640 --> 37:27.360
been discussing over the course of this conversation and more is by exactly as you say, making

37:27.360 --> 37:32.120
sure that people have the tools to get access to their own truth. So then they can bring

37:32.120 --> 37:36.680
that truth, they can bring it forward into, you know, the greater conversation, which

37:36.680 --> 37:42.520
is really about a co-creative space. It's about hearing what are the various needs of

37:42.520 --> 37:47.320
all of the people that are affected by any given policy or any even structure and including

37:47.320 --> 37:51.160
them in that conversation. And the only way I believe that they can be fully and truly

37:51.160 --> 37:56.760
included is if, you know, these the people themselves have that awareness of their power

37:56.760 --> 38:02.680
and of their access, which I think, as you say, like, is very, very, you know, I think

38:02.680 --> 38:06.600
psychedelics are one of the most consistent and effective ways for that to happen. And

38:06.600 --> 38:10.920
they're not the only way, but they work really well. And they work, you know, consistently

38:10.920 --> 38:16.360
in a way that a lot of other modalities, whether it's meditation or whatever else, don't or

38:16.360 --> 38:21.000
at least at least that takes so much longer to do. And frankly, we're we are in a time

38:21.000 --> 38:25.040
of crisis, you know, all of the optimism that I've got still can't shield me from the fact

38:25.040 --> 38:29.600
that we are living in a time of crisis, both with respect to climate change and with respect

38:29.600 --> 38:34.440
to authoritarianism in the world, with respect to this really toxic relationship between

38:34.440 --> 38:39.840
huge religious structures and nation states, wielding, wielding, you know, aggressive this

38:39.840 --> 38:45.640
monopoly on violence, I think affects so many people around the world that, you know, if

38:45.640 --> 38:52.200
the work that we do can even free the minds, free the minds of a few people at a time,

38:52.200 --> 38:57.720
you know, one experience at a time, ideally in legal context, where it's safe, where they

38:57.720 --> 39:01.120
don't have to worry about criminality, where they don't have to worry about negative effects,

39:01.120 --> 39:05.040
where they have kind of auxiliary support structure that I think people really need

39:05.040 --> 39:10.880
for responsible psychedelic use and for responsible substance use use, then we can see that, you

39:10.880 --> 39:15.760
know, that pro drug position or at least that position that some substance use can be really

39:15.760 --> 39:20.920
beneficial for some people is not so radical after all. I mean, we've got this serious

39:20.920 --> 39:25.400
dedication to, you know, the pharmaceutical drug model. So it's not like it's unprecedented

39:25.400 --> 39:29.000
that putting a substance in your body can be good for you. We're really just trying

39:29.000 --> 39:32.840
to show that the substances that people have been so afraid of for so long fall into that

39:32.840 --> 39:38.440
category also. Yeah, we're alcohol. And I should add, not only fall into that category,

39:38.440 --> 39:43.200
but expand that category beyond our understanding. It's, it's really not just about having more

39:43.200 --> 39:47.000
pharmaceuticals and having more, you know, structure within the medical context. It's

39:47.000 --> 39:53.200
really about using the medical context as one vehicle for access through legal access,

39:53.200 --> 39:56.800
which which can be in a variety of different kind of contexts, depending on depending on

39:56.800 --> 40:02.640
the needs. And, you know, hopefully, hopefully down the line with a diversity of options

40:02.640 --> 40:06.440
that that have been kind of sourced from the people themselves from the community themselves

40:06.440 --> 40:11.920
of people that need it. Yeah, absolutely. I've always been very open about my positive

40:11.920 --> 40:17.000
experiences with psychedelics. And when I say positive, not all of them were smooth

40:17.000 --> 40:23.240
sailing, you know, I've had a lot of what people call bad trips, but even those I think,

40:23.240 --> 40:27.400
you know, it's something that you it's something inside of you that you have to deal with.

40:27.400 --> 40:31.880
And once you deal with it, that bad trip all of a sudden turns into one of one of the most

40:31.880 --> 40:36.720
valuable experiences of your life. But I never advocated that, hey, you definitely have to

40:36.720 --> 40:43.160
go and take it because it affects different people differently. But I think public education,

40:43.160 --> 40:49.200
as is the case with technology, that any technology works as well as a society that adapts it.

40:49.200 --> 40:55.920
This seems to be the same case that as more educated the society is better results and

40:55.920 --> 41:03.560
better future. These kind of studies that are so fundamental to who we really are. Yeah,

41:03.560 --> 41:07.880
will turn out to be in our societies. So yeah, I really do think you guys are doing a fantastic

41:07.880 --> 41:11.840
job and a great job. And I wanted to ask you about the recent conference that you guys

41:11.840 --> 41:17.760
also had with maps. If you can talk a little about that. Sure. Yeah. So we just had it

41:17.760 --> 41:24.280
was in April 2017. So it was just about a month and a half ago. Now, we had our, I think,

41:24.280 --> 41:31.400
third psychedelic science conference, which was the largest convening of psychedelic researchers

41:31.400 --> 41:37.360
and kind of therapists and people who work in the psychedelic culture, of all time, to

41:37.360 --> 41:42.520
the extent of our knowledge, there were almost 3000 people, I think we had about 2800 attendees

41:42.520 --> 41:49.800
from almost 50 countries that were there for a variety of reasons, but really in particular

41:49.800 --> 41:58.080
to get updated on not only the state of the science, so the state of the formal, legally

41:58.080 --> 42:03.000
sanctioned investigations that are happening at research centers around the globe, but

42:03.000 --> 42:07.880
also to get kind of clicked into where exactly the movement for legal access to psychedelics

42:07.880 --> 42:14.280
actually is, which is a question of both the research and the culture and kind of the social

42:14.280 --> 42:21.480
political conscious context, which we've kind of been discussing a bit in this conversation.

42:21.480 --> 42:28.240
It was overall a humongous success. I think that there was over, you know, there are literally

42:28.240 --> 42:33.440
over a hundred separate sessions, there were community forums and film screenings, and

42:33.440 --> 42:39.080
of course lots and lots and lots of scientific presentations, and it was interesting because

42:39.080 --> 42:46.880
it kind of represented this checkpoint or kind of like a watershed moment for the movement.

42:46.880 --> 42:50.200
People have been talking now for a couple years about this renaissance that's occurring

42:50.200 --> 42:55.800
in the world of psychedelics because after 30 or 40 years of totally dead space when

42:55.800 --> 43:02.520
it came to research into psychedelics between the late 70s, early 80s and today, there's

43:02.520 --> 43:10.400
been this major increase in funding and actual, like funding for investigations to investigations

43:10.400 --> 43:15.520
themselves and to content and kind of like conclusions being drawn out of these investigations.

43:15.520 --> 43:20.000
So for the first time in many, many years, we're getting this rapid increase in access

43:20.000 --> 43:27.880
to information about exactly what psychedelics do and what context, and that amazing increase

43:27.880 --> 43:35.120
in information has resulted in this really serious reconsideration of how the movement

43:35.120 --> 43:40.880
generally talks about legal access. So I can just briefly share some of the big themes

43:40.880 --> 43:41.880
that came up.

43:41.880 --> 43:45.720
Sure, yeah, and this was not your first conference, right?

43:45.720 --> 43:49.600
This was actually my first conference. I had not attended the one, and I should clarify,

43:49.600 --> 43:54.600
the conferences are every four years, so they're not very frequent, and that's part of why

43:54.600 --> 44:01.480
so many people showed up because there are quite a few psychedelic conferences around

44:01.480 --> 44:08.920
the world that are happening all year and every year. In fact, just last fall, I attended

44:08.920 --> 44:12.760
a psychedelic conference in Prague called Beyond Psychedelics. I attended one in New

44:12.760 --> 44:19.280
York that happens every year called Horizons, and then I attended the second biannual IOWASCA,

44:19.280 --> 44:24.420
World IOWASCA Conference, which was actually in Brazil and the Amazon. So there's a lot

44:24.420 --> 44:27.920
of conferences happening, there's a lot of conversation happening, but psychedelic science

44:27.920 --> 44:33.760
kind of stands in its own category, both because it's so big, it's literally thousands and

44:33.760 --> 44:38.720
thousands of people, and also because MAPS has been in the game for so long because we,

44:38.720 --> 44:44.120
as an organization, have been working in the space around psychedelic research and thus

44:44.120 --> 44:52.640
policy for so long that we're seen as leaders in these conversations, which is why the really

44:52.640 --> 44:56.960
big themes that came out over the course of the conference are not only relevant for us

44:56.960 --> 45:02.200
at MAPS as we start to move forward in the process of beginning our Phase III MDMA research,

45:02.200 --> 45:07.680
publishing more research that we've sponsored around Ibogaine and other substances, but

45:07.680 --> 45:14.280
also for the movement more generally. So there are a few really, really big pieces, I think,

45:14.280 --> 45:20.240
that are worth mentioning because you'll see them come up over and over in the conversation

45:20.240 --> 45:27.080
around legal access to psychedelics and psychedelic research and therapy moving forward. One of

45:27.080 --> 45:30.520
the first ones and one of the things that I think is really close to my heart is the

45:30.520 --> 45:36.480
question of access. We kind of touched on this earlier, but there's this concern that

45:36.480 --> 45:42.860
if and when, I'll say when, certain psychedelics become legally available for use for people

45:42.860 --> 45:48.240
who have been diagnosed with certain disorders, whether it's PTSD or anxiety as a result

45:48.240 --> 45:53.960
of the end of life, of their end of life or terminal illnesses or anxiety or addiction,

45:53.960 --> 46:02.320
whatever it is, opioid use disorder, there's this very real question that I think has been

46:02.320 --> 46:06.480
relevant in the general medical community around access and I think will be particularly

46:06.480 --> 46:11.400
important in the conversation on psychedelics. So when I say access, I mean that especially

46:11.400 --> 46:15.960
in places like the United States where we have a healthcare system that, as I mentioned

46:15.960 --> 46:19.480
earlier, leaves a lot of people behind that costs a tremendous amount of money that is

46:19.480 --> 46:23.640
not accessible to every population, which means that quality healthcare, especially

46:23.640 --> 46:29.360
mental healthcare, is severely inaccessible to a number of populations in the United States

46:29.360 --> 46:35.320
and outside. One great example is that when most people think about PTSD, post-traumatic

46:35.320 --> 46:40.160
stress disorder, they're thinking about people who have returned from war, who've returned

46:40.160 --> 46:45.200
from a violent conflict, or for people who have survived physical or sexual assault.

46:45.200 --> 46:51.000
And I think rightfully so because those populations are very real examples of people who've experienced

46:51.000 --> 46:56.000
who have PTSD. The unfortunate reality, though, is that there's also tremendous populations

46:56.000 --> 47:02.440
in the United States and otherwise that experience PTSD that are dramatically underdiagnosed.

47:02.440 --> 47:06.120
And unless there's some sort of change in the way that we deal with mental healthcare

47:06.120 --> 47:10.880
and deal with diagnosis and access to treatment, then we can legalize all the psychedelics

47:10.880 --> 47:14.640
we want, but those people will still not get access to treatment. So one example is that

47:14.640 --> 47:23.280
they've done studies where teenagers in parts of Atlanta, in inner-city Atlanta, experience

47:23.280 --> 47:27.560
as high comparable or higher rates of PTSD than people who come from war. And that's

47:27.560 --> 47:33.920
purely as a result of trauma from racial discrimination over the course of their lives. Similarly,

47:33.920 --> 47:38.160
trans people experience trauma from being discriminated against from the process of

47:38.160 --> 47:43.540
misgendering in the way that society has yet to properly understand how to deal with populations

47:43.540 --> 47:48.020
that are non-binary, people who are non-binary, who have kind of different than the status

47:48.020 --> 47:54.360
quo gender identities. So there's huge populations of people who experience constant trauma,

47:54.360 --> 47:58.720
constant discrimination on a daily or almost daily basis for their whole lives, and often

47:58.720 --> 48:03.040
for many generations who aren't diagnosed with PTSD because they don't really fit that

48:03.040 --> 48:08.320
paradigm. So when we're thinking about access to psychedelics, a lot of people, myself included,

48:08.320 --> 48:12.960
believe that we need to be talking not only about the logistics, like how do we get insurance

48:12.960 --> 48:18.040
to cover MDMA when that becomes real? How do we get cannabis to be something that's

48:18.040 --> 48:22.240
openly available for people with PTSD via the Veterans Administration? These big questions.

48:22.240 --> 48:26.260
But also, what about the many people that the current medical system is leaving behind?

48:26.260 --> 48:30.080
How can we include them in the conversation? And that will be a really interesting edge

48:30.080 --> 48:35.440
moving forward because the psychedelic community in the United States and in many other places

48:35.440 --> 48:40.120
is pretty white and pretty privileged and pretty much kind of fits the demographics

48:40.120 --> 48:44.500
of people who you expect to be able to work in a space that's much riskier, that requires

48:44.500 --> 48:48.360
much more privilege to be in comfortably. People with less privilege, with less access

48:48.360 --> 48:52.920
to resources are much less likely to be in spaces and to be working in spaces where they

48:52.920 --> 48:57.280
have to literally put their lives or their livelihoods at risk to be doing that kind

48:57.280 --> 48:58.280
of work.

48:58.280 --> 49:00.000
That's a very good point. Yeah.

49:00.000 --> 49:03.680
Yeah. And I think that it's the same with people who are doing all kinds of advocacy.

49:03.680 --> 49:09.000
It's like the people who are putting themselves on the line are often people who feel comfortable

49:09.000 --> 49:13.440
enough where they don't feel at risk by being criminalized, of being kind of harmed by the

49:13.440 --> 49:17.680
system. So it's up to those of us with that privilege and with that space who have it

49:17.680 --> 49:26.080
right now to include those voices in our conversation until they're ready to show up themselves.

49:26.080 --> 49:31.720
And I'm not saying that people from communities of color, gender non-binary communities aren't

49:31.720 --> 49:35.560
showing up because they certainly are. They absolutely are. And they're putting their

49:35.560 --> 49:39.640
voices in this conversation also. But we've got a lot of work to do if we're going to

49:39.640 --> 49:41.000
be talking about long-term access.

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
So we have a lot of work to do on a social level first.

49:44.000 --> 49:50.160
Exactly. Exactly. And that's the thing. This issue is not necessarily an issue about psychedelic

49:50.160 --> 49:54.600
period. It's about access to medicine and access to healthcare, which is much broader

49:54.600 --> 49:58.360
than just our work. But I think that for the psychedelic movement to move forward with

49:58.360 --> 50:03.200
integrity, we should be including that conversation in the process of these other bigger conversations

50:03.200 --> 50:05.400
that we're having.

50:05.400 --> 50:08.520
So that's one. The other really big theme that I want to just discuss really quickly

50:08.520 --> 50:12.120
is the question around... And these themes are somewhat linked, but the question around

50:12.120 --> 50:18.560
not-for-profit versus for-profit drug development. The current medical system also is really

50:18.560 --> 50:23.240
reliant on a for-profit pharmaceutical model, which not only has the problems that I just

50:23.240 --> 50:29.520
described in this last little bit of the conversation, but also, frankly, is really expensive and

50:29.520 --> 50:37.040
is very difficult to ensure that the actual process of developing these substances in

50:37.040 --> 50:39.440
legal terms is available.

50:39.440 --> 50:42.440
So I think that that's another big question that the movement will have to grapple with

50:42.440 --> 50:47.680
and decide. Although MAPS, we were working on a hybrid, non-profit, for-profit model

50:47.680 --> 50:55.560
with the MAPS Public Benefit Corporation. There's a diversity of perspectives around

50:55.560 --> 51:00.040
how we as a movement should be dealing with that and how we should be moving forward.

51:00.040 --> 51:02.200
And that was another major theme.

51:02.200 --> 51:06.320
And finally, just to wrap this thought up, the other big theme that came up a lot is

51:06.320 --> 51:11.560
how the West and the North can be in right relation with Indigenous communities who've

51:11.560 --> 51:16.240
offered us not only the substances that they've been using, whether they're plants or molecules

51:16.240 --> 51:25.160
or whatever else, but also how we as a movement can be mindful of how we articulate access

51:25.160 --> 51:31.480
to psychedelics in the long run. Because although there is a lot more attention, again, as you

51:31.480 --> 51:36.600
mentioned, to these social issues, they will inevitably repeat themselves and they will

51:36.600 --> 51:43.640
inevitably kind of be unearthed in this process of talking about medicine, especially because

51:43.640 --> 51:51.600
psychedelics have this particular unique quality, even in their use, where they, like I said

51:51.600 --> 51:57.640
earlier, kind of pull out all of the stuff that people try to keep down. And I think

51:57.640 --> 52:00.880
dealing with that in the light will be really important with the movement moving forward.

52:00.880 --> 52:02.400
And you saw a lot of that.

52:02.400 --> 52:06.680
And actually, I should just add, I'm going really with some of the most critical big

52:06.680 --> 52:12.040
issues, but the other big takeaway from the conference was that there's some amazing science

52:12.040 --> 52:16.240
happening and that we're making a tremendous amount of progress. And I think that you and

52:16.240 --> 52:20.280
your listeners should be on the lookout for a tremendous, tremendous amount of scientific

52:20.280 --> 52:25.600
progress and evidence-based progress in the next two to four years, especially. In the

52:25.600 --> 52:29.640
immediate future, we'll see a lot of really, really big research coming out around how

52:29.640 --> 52:34.880
these substances induce mystical states or heightened states of consciousness or therapeutic

52:34.880 --> 52:40.800
states or how different forms of use can have different positive impacts for a tremendous

52:40.800 --> 52:42.120
number of populations.

52:42.120 --> 52:47.160
So yeah, that's awesome. And I think that's a great way to conclude the conference by

52:47.160 --> 52:52.120
talking about how much great work is being done by science, because I always have thought

52:52.120 --> 52:56.320
that any challenge or any difficulty is an opportunity for something beautiful.

52:56.320 --> 52:58.040
Absolutely. Absolutely.

52:58.040 --> 53:02.440
Let me ask you the last question. I ask all my guests that if you come across an intelligent

53:02.440 --> 53:07.560
alien from a different civilization, what would you say as the worst thing humanity

53:07.560 --> 53:10.960
has done and what would you say as humanity's greatest achievement?

53:10.960 --> 53:18.120
Ooh, that's a fantastic question. I think that the biggest sin, I guess I would say

53:18.120 --> 53:22.320
I'm using that language sort of facetiously, but kind of not. The biggest sin that humanity

53:22.320 --> 53:35.680
has committed has allowed itself and actually created systems that have promoted the separation

53:35.680 --> 53:48.000
between us and the Earth and us and the stars. I think that our lack of empathy toward the

53:48.000 --> 53:55.200
Earth and toward the literal home that we live on has translated into this deep lack

53:55.200 --> 54:00.440
of empathy for each other. And I think a lot of the harms that we're seeing and the big

54:00.440 --> 54:05.120
mistake I guess that I would say that I've seen that I think that we're really trying

54:05.120 --> 54:13.120
to solve is this deep instinct that humanity has been trained and conditioned into that

54:13.120 --> 54:18.040
there is an other. I think that's a big mistake to believe that there is an other, that we're

54:18.040 --> 54:26.000
not all part of the same energetic ecological biological ecosystem. And I think that that

54:26.000 --> 54:30.240
was a big mistake. And I think that the bigger mistake and the worst thing that we've done

54:30.240 --> 54:36.400
is really turn what was maybe a mistake or something that happened as a result of a variety

54:36.400 --> 54:40.800
of major social changes over the course of history and then weaponize that. And I think

54:40.800 --> 54:46.240
turn that into something that now people make money off of and hurt other human beings off

54:46.240 --> 54:54.720
of. I think that's one of the biggest tragedies that humanity has kind of unearthed in our

54:54.720 --> 55:02.240
own consciousness. I think the best thing, humanity has done some pretty amazing things.

55:02.240 --> 55:07.000
I think that I have to give a lot of credit to like Indian food. I think Indian food is

55:07.000 --> 55:12.400
one of the best things that humanity has done. But you know, I'm biased because I've got

55:12.400 --> 55:19.920
Indian heritage. But no, but on a more serious note, I think that entire framework and process

55:19.920 --> 55:24.920
of storytelling, and in particular, verbal storytelling, it's one of the reasons I love

55:24.920 --> 55:28.960
doing podcasts and I got it's been fantastic talking to you because I think that the art

55:28.960 --> 55:34.960
of verbal storytelling, like the art of oral communication, and not only like the information

55:34.960 --> 55:39.920
that's contained in the that in those conversations and conversation and in storytelling, but

55:39.920 --> 55:46.240
also all of the social and cultural kind of elements that go with storytelling with, you

55:46.240 --> 55:52.100
know, the aspect of intergenerational learning, the aspect of articulating our experiences

55:52.100 --> 55:56.360
for others to share the aspect of integrating challenging experiences, you know, whether

55:56.360 --> 56:00.560
it's with a psychedelic or because you went out into the forest and had a crazy experience

56:00.560 --> 56:05.720
with like a bear, I don't know, like whatever, whatever the experience is, I think that developing

56:05.720 --> 56:09.840
and cherishing the art of storytelling has been one of the most amazing things that humans

56:09.840 --> 56:17.040
have done. And I really look forward to storytelling, you know, the simple act of sharing personal

56:17.040 --> 56:23.280
experience as being one of the front and centerpieces of this movement for not just access to psychedelics,

56:23.280 --> 56:51.720
but really access to a more empathetic and compassionate society moving forward.
