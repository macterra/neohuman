00:00.000 --> 00:04.680
somebody like AOC saying it's more important to be morally correct than factually correct

00:04.680 --> 00:08.540
or morally right than factually correct or however the exact phrasing goes, that's actually

00:08.540 --> 00:09.540
the same thing.

00:09.540 --> 00:13.720
It's this appealing back to these immature models that suit our intuitions, our moral

00:13.720 --> 00:19.140
feelings about things, rather than trying to actually understand the world.

00:19.140 --> 00:30.720
And that is actually a catastrophe when you live in an advanced democracy, in an advanced

00:30.720 --> 00:33.000
world.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.880
Hello and welcome to the 76th episode of A New Human Podcast.

00:37.880 --> 00:41.760
I'm a Gabbahari edigologist on Twitter and Instagram, and you can follow this show on

00:41.760 --> 00:47.260
LiveInLimbo.com, iTunes, YouTube, BitChute, and soon on Spotify.

00:47.260 --> 00:51.040
And today with me, I have the pleasure of having James Lindsay.

00:51.040 --> 00:53.520
Welcome to New Human Podcast, James.

00:53.520 --> 00:54.520
Thanks for having me.

00:54.520 --> 00:55.520
Absolutely.

00:55.520 --> 00:58.680
Let's start with your background, the work you've done, the lives you've lived, and what

00:58.680 --> 01:01.320
do you mainly focus on now these days?

01:01.320 --> 01:04.640
Oh, God.

01:04.640 --> 01:11.020
So my background, I guess it's relevant to mention that I have a doctorate in mathematics,

01:11.020 --> 01:12.520
but I don't do mathematics.

01:12.520 --> 01:16.320
And I've not done mathematics professionally in 10 years.

01:16.320 --> 01:23.720
So that kind of places me educationally, but maybe sort of professionally.

01:23.720 --> 01:33.200
So what happened from finishing my doctorate and then leaving academia, I started to get

01:33.200 --> 01:39.860
into kind of this independent vein of research around religion and ultimately mostly psychology

01:39.860 --> 01:41.920
related to religion.

01:41.920 --> 01:43.240
That developed for a number of years.

01:43.240 --> 01:47.080
I was involved in what would have been called the New Atheist Movement.

01:47.080 --> 01:53.600
And I kind of watched that get eaten from the inside by social justice, if you will.

01:53.600 --> 02:01.080
And my attentions turned to that as that was unfolding in front of me.

02:01.080 --> 02:07.480
I would say that if I had a consistent theme in life that's kind of driven me is that I

02:07.480 --> 02:11.280
can't stand stupidness and unfairness.

02:11.280 --> 02:15.520
And so that was exhibiting both.

02:15.520 --> 02:19.800
So I felt like I had to say something about it and understand it and try to do something

02:19.800 --> 02:20.800
with it.

02:20.800 --> 02:27.040
And then I became something of a figure by my participation in what has come to be known

02:27.040 --> 02:29.400
as the Grievance Studies Affair.

02:29.400 --> 02:36.920
So I don't know if your listeners know what that is, but in 2017 and 18, I with two colleagues

02:36.920 --> 02:45.720
who are named Peter Boghossian and Helen Pluckrose wrote a series of kind of quality assurance

02:45.720 --> 02:52.340
testing of bogus academic papers that targeted fields like gender studies, which we summarized

02:52.340 --> 02:55.080
under the heading Grievance Studies.

02:55.080 --> 03:02.920
And we actually wrote 20 of them and we submitted them to the highest standing academic journals

03:02.920 --> 03:10.160
that were within scope of what we were arguing and seven of those were accepted for publication.

03:10.160 --> 03:13.040
Four of them were actually published.

03:13.040 --> 03:15.480
One of them won an award for excellence.

03:15.480 --> 03:17.420
Seven more were still under peer review.

03:17.420 --> 03:21.720
Some of them were rather favorable reviews.

03:21.720 --> 03:27.120
When the Wall Street Journal published an expose of what we were doing having been caught

03:27.120 --> 03:30.180
out in the middle of it and not getting to wrap it up.

03:30.180 --> 03:36.480
And so since then, I've been studying this material really deeply.

03:36.480 --> 03:41.720
I've written a book with Peter Boghossian about how to have impossible conversations,

03:41.720 --> 03:47.880
that's the title of it, to figure out how to talk to people with whom we don't agree.

03:47.880 --> 03:52.980
And then I have written a book with the other of my colleagues, Helen Pluckrose, diving

03:52.980 --> 04:00.240
more deeply into the academic theory that has put the legs underneath social justice scholarship.

04:00.240 --> 04:06.520
It's not exactly a book that explains how we did the fake papers project, but it does

04:06.520 --> 04:12.080
explain the theory in which we were using it or an aspect of the theory.

04:12.080 --> 04:15.800
In particular, it traces its postmodern roots.

04:15.800 --> 04:22.040
So that book's called Cynical Theories and it comes out in August or after the pandemic

04:22.040 --> 04:25.560
kind of more vaguely depending on what happens with the book industry.

04:25.560 --> 04:33.040
And so I also started a website called New Discourses and it's kind of a platform for

04:33.040 --> 04:35.160
educational resources.

04:35.160 --> 04:40.000
My goal is to help people understand kind of the crazy currents in society.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.600
So I've studied, for example, social justice theory rather deeply now.

04:43.600 --> 04:44.760
I can understand it.

04:44.760 --> 04:49.320
I can actually think kind of it's like, you know, when people learn other languages, they

04:49.320 --> 04:52.840
say that there's this point you cross where you can dream in another language.

04:52.840 --> 04:57.320
I can do that with the social justice mentality.

04:57.320 --> 05:01.160
And so I'm trying to explain it and other related phenomena.

05:01.160 --> 05:06.080
And I'm, you know, open to explaining other things that are kind of failures of communication

05:06.080 --> 05:09.760
and sense making on the platform.

05:09.760 --> 05:11.400
So that's what I've been up to.

05:11.400 --> 05:12.400
That's who I am.

05:12.400 --> 05:18.760
I had Peter on a podcast, Peter Boghossian, for the book, How to Have Impossible Conversations

05:18.760 --> 05:23.440
and I found it interesting that the summary of our conversation was that, well, you must

05:23.440 --> 05:29.120
be willing to have a conversation at first in order to learn how to have impossible conversations.

05:29.120 --> 05:33.600
And it seems like such an impossible task to talk to these social justice people because

05:33.600 --> 05:37.700
they're coming from the place of faith rather than reason and conversation.

05:37.700 --> 05:39.240
Have you felt it the same way?

05:39.240 --> 05:40.240
Yeah.

05:40.240 --> 05:44.480
I mean, there's actually multiple levels upon which that's a problem.

05:44.480 --> 05:46.320
One of those is that you're right.

05:46.320 --> 05:51.040
They're coming from something that's much more a position of faith than it is from reason.

05:51.040 --> 05:56.480
Secondly, the amount of, I mean, they've kind of, on one level, they've kind of given up

05:56.480 --> 06:03.120
on having conversation because they occupy a completely different understanding of everything

06:03.120 --> 06:04.120
in the world.

06:04.120 --> 06:09.160
It's very difficult to communicate that and I sound crazy when I say it, but it's true.

06:09.160 --> 06:14.000
They have a completely different theory of what a person is.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.520
It started with the personal is the political and it's now arrived at a person is their

06:18.520 --> 06:19.520
politics.

06:19.520 --> 06:22.520
So if you don't understand that, you're just going to talk past them.

06:22.520 --> 06:26.560
They have their own theory of mind, theory of agency, theory of knowledge, theory of

06:26.560 --> 06:28.360
ethics.

06:28.360 --> 06:32.960
They've got their kind of an entire, I said to somebody the other day, in fact, that to

06:32.960 --> 06:39.800
call it a religion misses the full scope of how radically different a way of thinking

06:39.800 --> 06:44.520
a fundamentalist religion maybe would be a better kind of a description, right?

06:44.520 --> 06:46.360
It's a fundamentalist religion indeed.

06:46.360 --> 06:47.360
Yes.

06:47.360 --> 06:50.280
And I can defend that, you know, rooted in the literature about what a fundamentalist

06:50.280 --> 06:58.280
religion is, but it's also, it's an, it's an entire culture that has it.

06:58.280 --> 07:01.740
It's like, you know, you talk about the subculture or whatever.

07:01.740 --> 07:06.680
It's no longer a subculture, but it is a completely different culture that understands the world

07:06.680 --> 07:10.640
in a completely different way on almost every conceivable level.

07:10.640 --> 07:13.800
And the third reason, so that they've shied away from conversation is the second reason

07:13.800 --> 07:18.080
here because all the conversations are just people talking past each other and they tell

07:18.080 --> 07:19.800
you over and over again that they're exhausted.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.320
I don't want to have to have this conversation.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.400
It's not my job to educate you, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

07:23.400 --> 07:24.400
They've had it.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.920
They tried it for a couple of years and it didn't work and they gave up.

07:26.920 --> 07:31.160
So they're just going to browbeat people now because it's a moral conversation which places

07:31.160 --> 07:33.400
it in the world of faith in a sense.

07:33.400 --> 07:37.880
And then the third reason is that they actually, because they have this weird view about power

07:37.880 --> 07:43.560
structures and the weird view about how language is relevant to power structures and association

07:43.560 --> 07:45.480
is relevant to power structures.

07:45.480 --> 07:51.120
They have this really weird view that the dialogue in fact is dangerous.

07:51.120 --> 07:54.420
The dialogue itself is part of the problem.

07:54.420 --> 07:59.720
So they have concepts like, well, I mean, just to talk about dialogue being dangerous

07:59.720 --> 08:04.480
that has pretty deep roots, but they even have concepts like what's called non-consensual

08:04.480 --> 08:10.720
co-platforming which means that, for example, if some social justice person published an

08:10.720 --> 08:16.360
article in say New York Times Opinion and then later I published an article critical

08:16.360 --> 08:20.800
of social justice things in New York Times Opinion because it's the same venue, the New

08:20.800 --> 08:24.800
York Times Opinion editors have now non-consensually, because they didn't ask the social justice

08:24.800 --> 08:29.320
person's permission to publish me, they have non-consensually co-platformed us, put us

08:29.320 --> 08:37.800
in the same outlet and therefore they become guilty and complicit in the problem or whatever

08:37.800 --> 08:38.800
that the social justice person is fighting.

08:38.800 --> 08:40.800
Facilitating this rape.

08:40.800 --> 08:41.840
Yeah.

08:41.840 --> 08:42.840
It's pretty much like that.

08:42.840 --> 08:48.640
And so they are actually not just exhausted of conversation, they're actually hostile

08:48.640 --> 08:54.900
to the idea of conversation because they believe that it perpetuates the problematic discourses.

08:54.900 --> 09:00.960
It perpetuates the power structures in society to even have dialogue.

09:00.960 --> 09:05.880
Their agenda is to, they have a different worldview and it is to utterly destroy the

09:05.880 --> 09:10.160
previous worldview, the one that most of us still operate within.

09:10.160 --> 09:15.200
So this alternate universe that they've created, this must have been built upon bunch of texts

09:15.200 --> 09:20.760
and bunch of opinions and bunch of worldviews and perspective coming mainly, which is what

09:20.760 --> 09:24.040
I learned from Peter, mainly from academia, right?

09:24.040 --> 09:26.080
So what has happened there?

09:26.080 --> 09:33.320
How all of this could have evolved in a way, this unreasonable course of action could have

09:33.320 --> 09:38.280
evolved within academia that's supposed to be a free platform for discourse and debates

09:38.280 --> 09:42.080
and conversation to the point that as you're saying, it's not a subculture anymore.

09:42.080 --> 09:47.280
It's an alternative culture that can very well threaten the rest of us who, you know,

09:47.280 --> 09:50.640
they're not even willing to talk to us.

09:50.640 --> 09:52.520
Do you want the short answer?

09:52.520 --> 09:59.400
I mean, I think it's really important to understand where does this come from that it all came

09:59.400 --> 10:00.880
from feminism.

10:00.880 --> 10:06.680
I can almost, not quite all from feminism, but and you know, this is a very long and

10:06.680 --> 10:10.400
complicated story depending on how we want to tell it, but how did it actually make its

10:10.400 --> 10:17.600
way into academia was primarily during the 1960s, but also going into the 1970s was this

10:17.600 --> 10:24.280
transition that was beginning in mostly English literature departments where you started to

10:24.280 --> 10:30.760
have, you know, mostly women doing feminism and occasionally you'd have, of course up

10:30.760 --> 10:38.440
until the 1960s, you would not have had say black professors or other in America racial

10:38.440 --> 10:43.720
minority professors being hired, but the university started to correct for this.

10:43.720 --> 10:48.240
They started to desegregate and integrate and so on, and they started bringing in faculty

10:48.240 --> 10:49.620
members of other races.

10:49.620 --> 10:54.080
And so some of these, again, mostly in English literature departments started to do things

10:54.080 --> 11:01.120
like women's studies, feminist studies, ethnic studies, African-American studies.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.340
And some of that's like, you know, obviously legit.

11:03.340 --> 11:07.120
If you want to look into that, you want to like say you're a literature professor and

11:07.120 --> 11:11.040
you want to focus on African-American literature or something like that, there's every reason

11:11.040 --> 11:13.960
to think that that's an interesting project.

11:13.960 --> 11:20.080
But because in particular with feminism, though it was in various degrees in all of this,

11:20.080 --> 11:25.840
the goal in feminism was very blatantly, very activist from the beginning.

11:25.840 --> 11:29.000
And they didn't have the, you know, a robust corpus of academic literature.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.600
So they kind of had to manufacture one on the spot and they started to build one.

11:33.600 --> 11:37.880
And more or less, the rest of the academy sort of turned a blind eye.

11:37.880 --> 11:43.880
So what actually happened was that universities started to allow these feminist literature

11:43.880 --> 11:49.640
professors to have feminist departments like women's studies, which went on to become gender

11:49.640 --> 11:53.760
studies, occasionally but very rarely feminist studies.

11:53.760 --> 11:56.640
It's much more commonly women's studies.

11:56.640 --> 12:00.920
And so they started creating these alternative departments and staffing them with what turned

12:00.920 --> 12:01.920
out to be activists.

12:01.920 --> 12:07.200
And this, of course, blossomed heavily during the new left rise in the late 60s and early

12:07.200 --> 12:08.960
1970s.

12:08.960 --> 12:15.200
And there you start getting those deeper currents of, you know, philosophy and history.

12:15.200 --> 12:20.160
The new left mostly was philosophically informed by the Frankfurt School, which is in a sense

12:20.160 --> 12:25.880
a it's a critical theory think tank that, you know, neo-Marxism is actually what it's

12:25.880 --> 12:29.760
called or sometimes cultural Marxism is what their project was called.

12:29.760 --> 12:35.960
And it tried to move the views of Marx out of the ideas of economics and into the ideas

12:35.960 --> 12:37.200
of culture.

12:37.200 --> 12:42.180
And so there, you know, there are these deep currents, but these feminist departments started

12:42.180 --> 12:46.880
to manufacture very agendas literature and a blind eye was turned to them for a very

12:46.880 --> 12:47.920
long time.

12:47.920 --> 12:49.160
Nobody wanted to criticize them.

12:49.160 --> 12:51.400
Nobody knew what was going on.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.560
Nobody wanted to get called a sexist for going after it.

12:53.560 --> 12:56.120
And they just kind of let them do what they want to do.

12:56.120 --> 13:00.440
And this corpus of literature started to build and build and build on itself.

13:00.440 --> 13:03.600
And it started to take on various other elements of critical theories.

13:03.600 --> 13:10.520
It took on postmodern theory in the 1980s or a garbled version thereof or something

13:10.520 --> 13:11.520
like that.

13:11.520 --> 13:18.440
And then it's just continued to grow where it's had the policy of saying that any criticism

13:18.440 --> 13:24.040
of it is illegitimate because it must be attacking the people, the women or the minorities

13:24.040 --> 13:28.060
rather than the scholarship itself.

13:28.060 --> 13:36.360
And it's been very, very effective at manipulating scholars in particular into not properly criticizing

13:36.360 --> 13:41.620
it because it'll call them sexist or racist or accuse them of complicity in some system

13:41.620 --> 13:42.620
of power.

13:42.620 --> 13:48.920
And so theory built upon theory, built upon theory, built upon theory for a number of

13:48.920 --> 13:55.240
decades, actually, to the point where finally, and I do say finally in a sense of, you know,

13:55.240 --> 13:57.200
there being a real turning point.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.440
This started, like I said, in the 1960s.

13:59.440 --> 14:06.760
It wasn't really until 2010 that this got a proper grip around the throat of society

14:06.760 --> 14:10.320
and stopped being some weird little academic subculture.

14:10.320 --> 14:14.560
But the short answer to your question is academic feminism is how it happened.

14:14.560 --> 14:18.520
And I guess just to make one real quick point about that, one of the most interesting weird

14:18.520 --> 14:25.880
things they did being literature professors is they took up the tools of literary criticism,

14:25.880 --> 14:32.760
which in particular for activists like feminist literary critics, it's a tool called close

14:32.760 --> 14:37.480
reading or discourse, also discourse analysis are two different tools.

14:37.480 --> 14:41.480
And close reading is, you know, you might read a text, its theme doesn't matter.

14:41.480 --> 14:46.560
You're only looking for the places where it supports, you know, maybe patriarchal ideas

14:46.560 --> 14:48.760
or thought or narratives or something like that.

14:48.760 --> 14:55.760
And then the whole text can be impugned based upon finding those things often which are

14:55.760 --> 15:00.500
not there, but are read into the text by the feminist at hand.

15:00.500 --> 15:09.920
And so because they took up this habit of studying women's issues in culture via tools

15:09.920 --> 15:15.600
like literary criticism uses, like they're reading it like society, they started to read

15:15.600 --> 15:20.000
literally like a book and to look for all of its little problematic features, which

15:20.000 --> 15:23.780
it assumed must be baked in because the power systems are there and so on.

15:23.780 --> 15:28.200
And so because they had this really bizarre approach, they also were able to insulate

15:28.200 --> 15:33.760
themselves from criticism because sociologists, for example, if they wanted to challenge this

15:33.760 --> 15:37.960
stuff wouldn't be able to because it's using techniques of literary criticism, which they

15:37.960 --> 15:42.320
have no expertise in and have no idea about because why in the world would they?

15:42.320 --> 15:45.240
It's not a sociological technique, it's literary criticism.

15:45.240 --> 15:48.960
So you know, they could play these kinds of games with those like out of scope theory

15:48.960 --> 15:54.040
building and they've built an entire alternate universe in the process.

15:54.040 --> 15:58.160
I don't want to let sociology totally off the hook either.

15:58.160 --> 16:05.640
Sociology mostly, it technically began with people like Emil Durkheim, but it was taken

16:05.640 --> 16:08.680
up very heavily by the critical theorists very intentionally.

16:08.680 --> 16:15.760
Most of early sociology developed under the auspices of entities, think tank type entities

16:15.760 --> 16:24.240
like the critical theorist Frankfurt School and like the socialist think tank Fabian Society,

16:24.240 --> 16:30.040
which went on to spawn the London School of Economics, for example, in the UK.

16:30.040 --> 16:34.480
So I mean, a lot of sociology was always done in a very agendas way.

16:34.480 --> 16:37.600
So it also has some issues there.

16:37.600 --> 16:39.760
And you can talk about it in other fields as well.

16:39.760 --> 16:44.720
Cultural anthropology had problems from very early on and so on.

16:44.720 --> 16:49.760
It just sounds like a very systematic and well thought of kind of a process that, as

16:49.760 --> 16:52.040
you said, it took a couple of decades.

16:52.040 --> 16:58.820
But the turning point that you mentioned 2010 is very aligned and completely makes sense

16:58.820 --> 17:03.480
with the growth of social media and alternative media basically.

17:03.480 --> 17:08.280
The kind of alliances that have been created between the neo-Marxist and this new left,

17:08.280 --> 17:12.680
far left, whatever you want to call them, with big tech and mainstream media, was that

17:12.680 --> 17:16.560
a turning point for that alliance as well and was that the reason that they basically

17:16.560 --> 17:23.040
became such a real threat, I would say, to whoever who disagree with them?

17:23.040 --> 17:27.800
So I think the other two things actually happening and they are related to one another here or

17:27.800 --> 17:28.800
maybe three things.

17:28.800 --> 17:31.800
We'll see how they pan out.

17:31.800 --> 17:37.720
Certainly the new media environment, which doesn't just and everybody thinks, oh, it's

17:37.720 --> 17:43.440
the Internet, it actually extends backwards to when even mass broadcasting became more

17:43.440 --> 17:44.840
democratized.

17:44.840 --> 17:49.720
When it used to be the case that there was like a really strong media monopoly held by

17:49.720 --> 17:55.920
CBS, NBC, a very small number of companies or if you were outside of the United States

17:55.920 --> 18:00.680
possibly state run operations.

18:00.680 --> 18:05.220
So there's kind of a media monopoly going on there and then that started to break as

18:05.220 --> 18:08.240
technology allowed more people to start doing talk radio.

18:08.240 --> 18:13.400
This has been in the 1980s and then eventually cable television and a proliferation of cable

18:13.400 --> 18:14.480
television stations.

18:14.480 --> 18:16.560
So now you weren't locked into just a few channels.

18:16.560 --> 18:21.080
Now you had, I mean, I remember the old Bruce Springsteen song, 57 channels and nothing's

18:21.080 --> 18:22.080
on.

18:22.080 --> 18:23.640
It was 57 at the time and it was 400.

18:23.640 --> 18:26.560
Now there's like literally thousands of them, I think.

18:26.560 --> 18:31.920
And then the Internet came along and just exploded this to the next level and then handheld

18:31.920 --> 18:36.320
devices came along and it's with you everywhere and exploded it to another level.

18:36.320 --> 18:43.000
And so these features, blogs in particular, were very influential early on at being able

18:43.000 --> 18:52.200
to connect people who had similar ideas and they sort of enable this whole appeal to these

18:52.200 --> 18:58.640
grievances or victimhood or trauma or harm and whip up a mob of people who are going

18:58.640 --> 19:01.560
to agitate in support of that.

19:01.560 --> 19:06.960
So it very much does require this kind of new media environment for it to exist.

19:06.960 --> 19:08.520
And I think that genie's out of the bottle.

19:08.520 --> 19:14.000
I don't think we're going back and I don't think we would want to go back to gated media

19:14.000 --> 19:20.720
communities, but definitely it was in that situation that this was possible.

19:20.720 --> 19:27.640
So one feature of that in terms of activism were, like I said, blogs, famously Tumblr,

19:27.640 --> 19:32.200
if you want to talk about where most of queer and gender theory exploded in the past 20

19:32.200 --> 19:37.480
years, 15 years I guess, would have been through the platform Tumblr, which considers itself

19:37.480 --> 19:39.680
a social media blogging platform.

19:39.680 --> 19:43.680
But other blogs were happening and people were writing and developing these theories

19:43.680 --> 19:51.120
in a way that was never possible before because it had to happen through academic publishing

19:51.120 --> 19:54.440
or even regular publishing, which requires a lot of infrastructure.

19:54.440 --> 19:55.440
It's slow.

19:55.440 --> 19:56.440
It's heavy.

19:56.440 --> 19:59.960
To get something published in academia takes months and months and months and months, but

19:59.960 --> 20:03.560
a blog publishes as fast as you push click on the mouse.

20:03.560 --> 20:08.480
You submit or update or whatever it happens to be, post whatever the label is on the button,

20:08.480 --> 20:10.120
and then it's everywhere.

20:10.120 --> 20:14.280
It's literally got a global distribution audience if people know about your blog.

20:14.280 --> 20:18.160
So that was a massive change that caused a lot of this.

20:18.160 --> 20:24.960
Meanwhile, in the academy itself, while these developments were happening in technology,

20:24.960 --> 20:32.320
the academy was building up on layer upon layer upon layer of generations of theory.

20:32.320 --> 20:38.880
So when these first feminists were writing this stuff, was it the Feminine Mystique?

20:38.880 --> 20:39.880
Was that right?

20:39.880 --> 20:40.880
No.

20:40.880 --> 20:41.880
The second sex.

20:41.880 --> 20:46.120
Simone de Beauvoir's second sex was in 1949.

20:46.120 --> 20:54.680
So starting then and kind of moving forward, it was very avant-garde and it was while the

20:54.680 --> 21:00.720
theorist says this and according to this theory, that, and according to that theory, and the

21:00.720 --> 21:03.520
lens of theory was made very clear.

21:03.520 --> 21:09.360
And then by 2010, it just started to be accepted that this is just, we know this stuff now.

21:09.360 --> 21:10.960
We know about these systems of power.

21:10.960 --> 21:16.080
These are realities of the world and people started talking that way.

21:16.080 --> 21:18.040
The phrase is known, knowns.

21:18.040 --> 21:20.980
It's actually hard to say that verbally and have people hear it.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.140
It's easy to write.

21:22.140 --> 21:25.240
So it's things that people just know are known.

21:25.240 --> 21:29.720
And so within the academy, there was this academic literature, there's this big shift

21:29.720 --> 21:37.680
in the late 2000 aughts into the early 2010s in which they're no longer appealing to the

21:37.680 --> 21:38.900
theoretical construct.

21:38.900 --> 21:41.000
They're just stating it like fact.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.480
And there's no longer this reliance on this really deep complicated jargon for the most

21:45.480 --> 21:46.480
part.

21:46.480 --> 21:47.480
They start stating it in very simple terms.

21:47.480 --> 21:52.320
In fact, a lot of their literature in the last 10 years reads like they're talking down

21:52.320 --> 21:56.600
to a 10 year old and a 10 year old could probably read a lot of it.

21:56.600 --> 22:03.240
So there's been this massive change in the academy because in their view, their theory

22:03.240 --> 22:07.960
has matured to the point where it's just true.

22:07.960 --> 22:12.360
And so that changed their perspective rather considerably.

22:12.360 --> 22:16.840
So those kinds of things, the technological advances made it possible for it to take root

22:16.840 --> 22:18.280
in the world.

22:18.280 --> 22:26.120
And then I hate to call it the maturity of theory because it's a very immature theory

22:26.120 --> 22:31.200
in another sense, but the fact that their theory has had many decades of building on

22:31.200 --> 22:36.760
itself just made it able to just be taken as in a sense, gospel.

22:36.760 --> 22:40.280
How can a theory become mature when it's contained by morality though?

22:40.280 --> 22:41.280
That's the thing.

22:41.280 --> 22:45.560
I keep bringing up what AOC said that it's more important to be moral than being factual

22:45.560 --> 22:47.960
or morally right than factually correct.

22:47.960 --> 22:51.560
It says everything that people need to know about this whole thing, that morality that

22:51.560 --> 22:54.040
comes from lack of factuality.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.720
Right.

22:55.720 --> 22:58.200
That's why I hesitate around the word mature.

22:58.200 --> 23:01.040
It matured in the sense of its own kind of ecosystem.

23:01.040 --> 23:03.640
It is not a mature theory of the world.

23:03.640 --> 23:06.080
It does not have a good understanding of things.

23:06.080 --> 23:14.840
It is in a sense, so in 2014, I believe, the astrophysicist Sean Carroll, who incidentally

23:14.840 --> 23:20.280
is very taken in by this social theory, which is kind of funny, had a debate with the famous

23:20.280 --> 23:27.840
evangelical Christian apologist, William Lane Craig, and he did that in Louisiana, I think

23:27.840 --> 23:32.200
in New Orleans in February, I think, of 2014.

23:32.200 --> 23:34.680
And it was a stunning spectacle to watch.

23:34.680 --> 23:41.460
I think it was actually a turning point in a sense for designing arguments about kind

23:41.460 --> 23:44.200
of moral ideologies.

23:44.200 --> 23:47.360
And what Sean Carroll did was stood up there and, you know, if you know about William Lane

23:47.360 --> 23:49.160
Craig, he's a very detailed debater.

23:49.160 --> 23:50.480
He's a very educated man.

23:50.480 --> 23:51.760
He's a very intelligent man.

23:51.760 --> 23:55.660
He's a very sharp debater, and he does do his homework.

23:55.660 --> 23:59.360
So he knows the other side fairly well.

23:59.360 --> 24:03.800
He knows where the holes are to pick at, and he can do it really, really well.

24:03.800 --> 24:08.240
And normally, he goes in these debates and he convinces a lot of people, and it's kind

24:08.240 --> 24:11.160
of back and forth about the details and everything gets all murky.

24:11.160 --> 24:12.760
And Sean Carroll didn't take that approach.

24:12.760 --> 24:17.120
Sean Carroll stood up there and said, yeah, you're putting forth, you know, you're talking

24:17.120 --> 24:21.400
about this model, and then there's this other model in cosmology, and this other model.

24:21.400 --> 24:22.760
There's lots of models.

24:22.760 --> 24:27.460
There are a lot of models, and this thing you're doing with theology is another model.

24:27.460 --> 24:31.800
But we actually have ways to tell how mature a model is, how good of a model of the world

24:31.800 --> 24:32.800
it is.

24:32.800 --> 24:33.800
It has to meet certain criteria.

24:33.800 --> 24:37.560
And he starts listing the criteria for a model to be grown up.

24:37.560 --> 24:40.400
And it's, you know, it can do this, it can do that, it has these properties.

24:40.400 --> 24:45.860
And he starts laying them out, and he's like, I don't know which theory of cosmology is

24:45.860 --> 24:47.720
correct and neither do you.

24:47.720 --> 24:52.000
But these that we're talking about that fall within cosmology are mature models because

24:52.000 --> 24:56.880
they meet all of these criteria, whereas the theology model doesn't meet any of the criteria

24:56.880 --> 24:59.700
except maybe the first one or something like that.

24:59.700 --> 25:01.560
And so this is the same thing that's happening here.

25:01.560 --> 25:05.360
When you see somebody like AOC saying it's more important to be morally correct than

25:05.360 --> 25:10.160
factually correct or morally right than factually correct or however the exact phrasing goes,

25:10.160 --> 25:11.240
it's actually the same thing.

25:11.240 --> 25:16.120
It's appealing back to these immature models that suit our intuitions, our moral feelings

25:16.120 --> 25:21.120
about things, rather than trying to actually understand the world.

25:21.120 --> 25:27.160
And that is actually a catastrophe when you live in an advanced democracy and an advanced

25:27.160 --> 25:28.640
world.

25:28.640 --> 25:33.560
When you live in a world that has the kind of technological power that we have in the

25:33.560 --> 25:39.280
kind of complex systems, even for like food distribution, you cannot go away from factually

25:39.280 --> 25:45.480
correct and expect that things to go okay.

25:45.480 --> 25:47.480
It is actually catastrophic.

25:47.480 --> 25:49.680
So it is very alarming.

25:49.680 --> 25:54.680
And so when I say it matured, I mean, it's like, I don't know a good, there are no good

25:54.680 --> 26:01.400
metaphors to use for it, but it's like it doesn't have the, it's not a mature model,

26:01.400 --> 26:06.840
but within its own ecosystem, it is now seen as a mature model is maybe the best way to

26:06.840 --> 26:07.840
put it.

26:07.840 --> 26:10.480
It's seen as something that's got a long academic pedigree.

26:10.480 --> 26:15.200
And then people outside of the model, say like Sean Carroll in this case, look upon

26:15.200 --> 26:17.200
this, and they're like, oh, well, they've been doing whatever they're doing.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.960
I don't know the details, but they've been doing it for, it's important for at least

26:19.960 --> 26:20.960
50 years.

26:20.960 --> 26:23.360
So, you know, it's pretty well established at this point.

26:23.360 --> 26:28.480
And then they have that sense of pretty well established, even though what's inside is

26:28.480 --> 26:29.880
utter crap.

26:29.880 --> 26:37.560
It's a moral agenda that's rooted in a very particular political view rather than anything

26:37.560 --> 26:44.960
like truth or knowledge or accuracy or civility or any of the norms of liberal society, for

26:44.960 --> 26:45.960
example.

26:45.960 --> 26:49.760
And what's interesting to me is that based on what you said, it became what it became

26:49.760 --> 26:54.960
because of democratization of information that has worked like a double-edged sword.

26:54.960 --> 26:59.080
That now they want to contain it in favor of themselves, you know, pushing YouTube,

26:59.080 --> 27:03.120
for example, removing channels that are talking against what they believe or Twitter, the

27:03.120 --> 27:04.120
same thing.

27:04.120 --> 27:10.560
Which begs the question, is democracy itself a platform that allow these people to take

27:10.560 --> 27:16.160
over based on because one vote is equal to another vote and, you know, a far left vote

27:16.160 --> 27:20.880
can neutralize a vote of irrational thinker?

27:20.880 --> 27:26.760
Have we reached the limits of representative democracy because people who believe in whatever

27:26.760 --> 27:29.840
they want to believe in and there's nothing we can't do about it because they believe

27:29.840 --> 27:30.840
in it?

27:30.840 --> 27:35.200
See, that's an interesting question because, I mean, even the ancient Greeks knew that

27:35.200 --> 27:41.400
democracy had its limits and they were very afraid of democracy.

27:41.400 --> 27:49.800
And so when the enlightenment liberalism phase in the mostly 18th century arose and we started

27:49.800 --> 27:55.920
establishing these things, we didn't establish democracies, we established Republican democracies.

27:55.920 --> 28:00.800
So the idea was actually there was supposed to be a layer of experts between legislation

28:00.800 --> 28:05.760
and the people because the people directly will never protect the minority interests.

28:05.760 --> 28:11.800
There are all kinds of problems with either mob ruler, majority ruler, so on and so forth.

28:11.800 --> 28:17.680
And so the idea was that you would have a competent professional class who the public

28:17.680 --> 28:22.680
then decide upon and then the competent professional class are going to be the ones who actually

28:22.680 --> 28:26.160
do the legislating and the governance.

28:26.160 --> 28:30.000
And of course, it's never worked out perfectly because people are people.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.920
And there have been lots of problems with it.

28:31.920 --> 28:37.360
In this, there have been a few things that have been going on over the past centuries

28:37.360 --> 28:43.600
or century in particular, which has been this great push for more and more and more and

28:43.600 --> 28:50.120
more democracy, like democracy is this unfettered good without a balancing more and more and

28:50.120 --> 28:56.680
more republicanism, which means that there is not necessarily a technocratic expert class

28:56.680 --> 29:02.800
in between, but that there is a professional class of people who actually when put up as

29:02.800 --> 29:04.400
representatives know what they're doing.

29:04.400 --> 29:09.760
So now it's like, because again, probably the way that things have changed, it's very

29:09.760 --> 29:14.780
easy to just become famous and then get elected based on your fame.

29:14.780 --> 29:19.060
We now have a problem and there's this big bias toward, oh, we've got to get these professionals

29:19.060 --> 29:20.060
out of here.

29:20.060 --> 29:24.280
We've got to get these citizens in Congress and it's actually, we probably don't, not

29:24.280 --> 29:25.840
very often anyway.

29:25.840 --> 29:33.920
And so now there's this odd problem where we still have a republican representative

29:33.920 --> 29:36.640
democracy, but we're electing morons.

29:36.640 --> 29:38.600
We're electing agenda driven fools.

29:38.600 --> 29:43.060
Luckily, there's still enough of a balance of power to keep that from doing anything.

29:43.060 --> 29:47.020
But the answer that it's arrived us at is utter stalemate.

29:47.020 --> 29:51.480
And since there's utter political stalemate, the result is that everything switches down

29:51.480 --> 29:55.120
to the next level, which is to start trying to enforce power through culture.

29:55.120 --> 30:00.480
Now as for them trying to take away the keys to free speech, which is a separate issue,

30:00.480 --> 30:03.360
it's really interesting because you can think of, this actually reveals that these people

30:03.360 --> 30:07.080
are tin pot dictators.

30:07.080 --> 30:12.060
Because what's happening is the dictator's dilemma as it sometimes gets called.

30:12.060 --> 30:15.600
The dictator's dilemma is an information rule.

30:15.600 --> 30:21.120
So with the dictator's dilemma, if you're a dictator, you have to figure out how to

30:21.120 --> 30:22.520
handle information flow.

30:22.520 --> 30:25.960
You know that your regime is doing things you don't want the public to find out about

30:25.960 --> 30:28.240
because then they'll depose you.

30:28.240 --> 30:35.880
So you've got this problem and you have to decide, well, do I allow information to flow

30:35.880 --> 30:37.480
or do I shut it off?

30:37.480 --> 30:42.440
And the dictator is in a dilemma once you get to a sufficient amount of information

30:42.440 --> 30:48.640
flow, not just a couple of state channels like you say have in North Korea because once

30:48.640 --> 30:54.480
there's information flow, if they allow it, it will be their undoing because their corruption

30:54.480 --> 30:57.640
and so on and brutality will be unmasked.

30:57.640 --> 31:02.400
That's what you saw happen with the Arab Spring, for example, arising was the brutality, like

31:02.400 --> 31:11.520
the Mubarak, what was it, yeah, Hasni Mubarak in Egypt, the brutality of that regime was

31:11.520 --> 31:16.600
exposed and all of a sudden everything erupted in Cairo in 2011.

31:16.600 --> 31:22.280
And so the other side of the coin is they can repress information, but then people know

31:22.280 --> 31:23.960
that the information is being repressed.

31:23.960 --> 31:29.240
So you out yourself as a dictator and people don't much like feeling like they're being

31:29.240 --> 31:32.140
lied to and having information restricted from them.

31:32.140 --> 31:37.240
And so when you see this as a social justice crowd now with these kind of big tech companies,

31:37.240 --> 31:40.840
you're having the same thing play out actually, the exact same dynamic is playing out.

31:40.840 --> 31:47.900
It's very clearly the same thing because you have this group of people all over social

31:47.900 --> 31:48.900
media.

31:48.900 --> 31:52.640
I don't want to say it's a hard group, but you have a lot of people acting on social

31:52.640 --> 31:58.320
media who are very aware that there are YouTube sensors, that there are Twitter sensors, that

31:58.320 --> 32:03.040
there are Facebook sensors and that these people are enacting their social vision on

32:03.040 --> 32:04.040
the public.

32:04.040 --> 32:11.480
So they're picking the repressed side of the dictator's dilemma, but once you choose either

32:11.480 --> 32:14.080
course of that, you then reveal yourself to be a dictator.

32:14.080 --> 32:18.960
So these people trying to know that they have hegemonic control over a lot of culture are

32:18.960 --> 32:22.840
trying to enact a dictatorial program.

32:22.840 --> 32:27.000
And the reasons are obvious besides the fact that they're explicitly anti-liberal and have

32:27.000 --> 32:33.600
blamed liberal society for every problem in the world going back to the 1920s.

32:33.600 --> 32:35.600
If you didn't know that, they do.

32:35.600 --> 32:40.320
One of the core pillars of what's called critical race theory is anti-liberalism.

32:40.320 --> 32:43.640
It's like the third pillar when they list them in order.

32:43.640 --> 32:45.720
It's sort of important to be anti-liberal.

32:45.720 --> 32:51.640
What are the first two?

32:51.640 --> 33:01.240
The first one is that racism is ordinary in American society and the second one is interest

33:01.240 --> 33:06.120
convergence, which is that members of, since it's race, we'll say it was just white people,

33:06.120 --> 33:13.160
but it's generally dominant groups, don't give opportunities to minority groups or oppressed

33:13.160 --> 33:16.080
groups unless it's also in their interest to do so.

33:16.080 --> 33:24.000
So there's always a selfish motive if things get better for any minority group.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
Those are the first two.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
And the third one is anti-liberalism.

33:26.000 --> 33:30.080
Do you think someone like Joe Biden is kind of helping these people or hurting them by

33:30.080 --> 33:36.280
saying stuff like, if you don't vote for me, you ain't black?

33:36.280 --> 33:39.720
What does that say?

33:39.720 --> 33:40.720
He's hurting.

33:40.720 --> 33:45.680
It's such a complicated way to start helping and hurting because it's like who?

33:45.680 --> 33:48.240
He's not helping his cause to get elected.

33:48.240 --> 33:54.520
That's for certain, but he is signaling to the in-crowd for the most part that he's kind

33:54.520 --> 33:59.320
of hip to the social justice jive, if you will.

33:59.320 --> 34:05.400
But even within the, like that one fell, the bad part is that Biden was probably just making

34:05.400 --> 34:09.360
a joke that landed really badly, whereas other people really do make that argument.

34:09.360 --> 34:10.680
I mean, it's not only Biden.

34:10.680 --> 34:17.920
The guy in Virginia wore blackface or KKK hood and like, whatever, Trudeau in Canada,

34:17.920 --> 34:22.800
he says clearly, I don't even remember how many times I wore blackface.

34:22.800 --> 34:28.520
He groped a 18 year old reporter in Montreal and like, I didn't do it.

34:28.520 --> 34:31.040
But you know, just imagine if Trump would be doing any of that.

34:31.040 --> 34:34.960
So this hypocrisy, I'm just wondering until what point the mainstream would be like, you

34:34.960 --> 34:39.880
know, there is no way that we can cover for these people.

34:39.880 --> 34:45.460
So I mean, the far left will cover for these people literally forever because your politics

34:45.460 --> 34:47.080
are your person.

34:47.080 --> 34:50.520
And so literally forever.

34:50.520 --> 34:53.000
So you're just going to have to deal with that.

34:53.000 --> 34:57.840
But the deal is what you just pointed out, the hypocrisy is obvious and everybody else

34:57.840 --> 34:58.840
hates it.

34:58.840 --> 35:02.840
I don't know why human beings are as sensitive to hypocrisy as we are.

35:02.840 --> 35:04.520
I know why we're sensitive to it.

35:04.520 --> 35:08.800
I mean, the reasons are easy to work out why we would be sensitive to hypocrisy.

35:08.800 --> 35:12.480
But because you got people who would be, you know, double dealing and telling people what

35:12.480 --> 35:14.760
to do and working their own advantage.

35:14.760 --> 35:19.640
So it makes sense why we're sensitive to it, but we are like psychologically hyper sensitive

35:19.640 --> 35:24.500
to the level where I'm almost convinced that we would gladly watch the world be destroyed

35:24.500 --> 35:29.280
around us as long as and do nothing, as long as we could call everybody out as hypocrites

35:29.280 --> 35:30.280
who's being a hypocrite.

35:30.280 --> 35:33.600
It's like it blinds us to every other concern.

35:33.600 --> 35:39.920
So like when this happens with Biden or when Ta-Nehisi Coates says that Kanye West is no

35:39.920 --> 35:44.080
longer black because he wore a MAGA hat and you know, these different examples that you've

35:44.080 --> 35:50.320
brought up with more stuff with Biden stuff around Trudeau, I mean, it's really everywhere.

35:50.320 --> 35:56.800
The Virginia guy, when you bring these things up, everybody else is like, ah, screw these

35:56.800 --> 35:57.800
people.

35:57.800 --> 35:58.800
They're hypocrites, right?

35:58.800 --> 36:04.000
What they're detecting is in the literature called parochial altruism, they're showing

36:04.000 --> 36:06.240
that, you know, these people are just playing for their team.

36:06.240 --> 36:08.060
They're not honest brokers.

36:08.060 --> 36:10.940
And then that turns people away from them.

36:10.940 --> 36:17.600
So I mean, Biden hurt his electoral chances, which hurts the progressive agenda rather

36:17.600 --> 36:23.960
a lot when he said that, but as it works out, depending on who you're asking, some of them

36:23.960 --> 36:28.360
very much were glad he said it and defended it and all of these things because it signals

36:28.360 --> 36:29.520
the right kind of politics.

36:29.520 --> 36:34.960
So it's like, I don't know, back, I'm old enough to remember and it's happening now

36:34.960 --> 36:39.400
on the left, but it was definitely more happening on the right 10, 15 years ago.

36:39.400 --> 36:48.300
What the saying was that conservatism doesn't fail, people fail conservatism.

36:48.300 --> 36:50.360
And it's like the same thing's happening on the left now.

36:50.360 --> 36:52.680
It's like social justice can't fail.

36:52.680 --> 36:54.440
People fail social justice.

36:54.440 --> 36:58.440
And when you have that, you have this situation where literally you're doing something that

36:58.440 --> 37:04.320
hurts your own interests, driving your movement more into the crazy.

37:04.320 --> 37:10.200
And nevertheless, people within it think it's the right thing to have done and believe that

37:10.200 --> 37:14.440
it helps their interests because they're more concerned about the depth of moral purity

37:14.440 --> 37:20.540
in their fundamentally religious at that point movement than they are about actually succeeding

37:20.540 --> 37:21.540
at anything.

37:21.540 --> 37:26.560
And this is, I mean, it's got to be said at some point very clearly, progressive social

37:26.560 --> 37:32.000
justice stuff isn't actually progressive at all.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.320
People call it the regressive left for a reason.

37:34.320 --> 37:36.700
There's no real interest in progress.

37:36.700 --> 37:38.000
It's not about progress.

37:38.000 --> 37:43.400
It's about empowering the people that have the ability to push this stuff.

37:43.400 --> 37:47.820
It's not about progress in any respect whatsoever.

37:47.820 --> 37:54.980
You mentioned the new atheist movement was also hijacked by the social justice and feminism.

37:54.980 --> 37:56.060
Would you expand on that?

37:56.060 --> 38:01.160
Because I also asked this question from Peter Boghossian that he was also very instrumental,

38:01.160 --> 38:04.760
obviously, in the new atheist movement that one of the argument is that the reason that

38:04.760 --> 38:10.040
we are here was because we have moved away from the values that have been created in

38:10.040 --> 38:15.400
the West and especially the United States because of Judeo-Christian approach and ethics

38:15.400 --> 38:20.560
and morality that had allowed liberalism, classic liberalism to grow to where it was.

38:20.560 --> 38:25.920
But new atheism basically came and said, none of that matters, but it created its own tribe

38:25.920 --> 38:30.040
and tribal attitude and approach of itself.

38:30.040 --> 38:38.120
I think that is in very, very impressionistic pictures, kind of accurate, but it gives the

38:38.120 --> 38:41.520
new atheist movement more credit than it deserves.

38:41.520 --> 38:48.840
I think it is generally right that the decline of what you might call traditional Judeo-Christian

38:48.840 --> 38:54.440
values, I kind of recoil at that term, but we'll go with it, did create and make the

38:54.440 --> 39:01.460
space for this, but again, the new atheist thing started in 2004.

39:01.460 --> 39:04.720
You can date it to the publication of The End of Faith by Sam Harris.

39:04.720 --> 39:09.240
It's widely agreed to be the beginning of the so-called new atheist movement.

39:09.240 --> 39:18.440
The deep criticism of liberalism and of religion and its role in maintaining inequalities in

39:18.440 --> 39:25.240
society dates back to the 1920s with the Frankfurt School for certain among other kind of parallel

39:25.240 --> 39:26.240
movements.

39:26.240 --> 39:29.880
Certainly, Marxism had these kinds of things and Nietzsche talked about these kinds of

39:29.880 --> 39:30.880
things.

39:30.880 --> 39:36.080
I think once Darwin wrote down the theory of evolution and even in some sense when once

39:36.080 --> 39:43.880
Newton wrote down the laws of motion, the ability to believe in a properly pre-modern

39:43.880 --> 39:50.880
world that's guided by the hand of deities was going to just start dissolving.

39:50.880 --> 39:53.120
We've had a slow dissolution.

39:53.120 --> 40:00.920
Now the atheist movement itself, the new atheist movement in 2004, I think it died out by 2015.

40:00.920 --> 40:05.960
It believes it's still in existence, but I think it was dead by 2015, so we'll give

40:05.960 --> 40:08.200
it that 11-year run.

40:08.200 --> 40:14.400
That came along and was very much so a blend of a kind of enlightenment rationalist thing

40:14.400 --> 40:19.760
and a very much social justice pissed off at religion for the way that it has treated

40:19.760 --> 40:22.000
women and gay people in particular.

40:22.000 --> 40:27.320
You had this very strong kind of gender and feminism driven social justice movement that

40:27.320 --> 40:28.760
was in it.

40:28.760 --> 40:37.360
It really did allow the, it did help, I should say, the incubation of that movement in American

40:37.360 --> 40:43.400
society and other English speaking societies in the world because it gave it a home and

40:43.400 --> 40:47.040
it gave it a lot of ability and it started to further crack those structures that were

40:47.040 --> 40:48.360
keeping it at bay.

40:48.360 --> 40:53.080
But I don't think, I think we would still be pretty close, if the new atheism had never

40:53.080 --> 40:57.280
happened, I think we'd still be pretty close to where we are now just because of the internet.

40:57.280 --> 40:58.440
Feminism was still happening.

40:58.440 --> 41:00.400
It just would have caught on somewhere else.

41:00.400 --> 41:06.840
It caught on in atheism first really in a very significant way for I think very significant

41:06.840 --> 41:11.640
reasons, which I said most of them were, many of the people involved in the new atheist

41:11.640 --> 41:16.600
movement were there because they were pissed off about the way that Christianity in the

41:16.600 --> 41:21.400
United States in particular was treating women and homosexuals.

41:21.400 --> 41:26.360
And so it was a social justice rooted movement that took up a lot of these critical theories

41:26.360 --> 41:29.480
off of all the blogs they were reading and sharing at the time.

41:29.480 --> 41:32.680
And so by 2008, 2009, it had got really hot.

41:32.680 --> 41:39.920
By 2011, there was a incident that became kind of the triggering incident where the

41:39.920 --> 41:44.440
community split around it and it was a death spiral from there.

41:44.440 --> 41:49.280
That was the so-called elevator gate incident, which I don't know if you are familiar with

41:49.280 --> 41:50.280
what happened.

41:50.280 --> 41:52.160
Peter probably described it, but maybe not.

41:52.160 --> 41:55.880
Please expand on that, I don't think I know about that.

41:55.880 --> 42:01.520
Okay, so what was going on up to that point was this is what happens in general.

42:01.520 --> 42:06.520
So it's worth paying attention if you have an organization and it's tipping like, oh,

42:06.520 --> 42:08.360
let's do some diversity stuff.

42:08.360 --> 42:09.360
Let's let that in.

42:09.360 --> 42:14.440
This is what happens in general and the atheist movement went through this in, like I said,

42:14.440 --> 42:19.440
the lead up would have been 2007, 8, 9, 10.

42:19.440 --> 42:25.900
And what happens is people increasingly start pushing for the activist agenda, the social

42:25.900 --> 42:26.900
justice agenda.

42:26.900 --> 42:30.200
In this case, like I said, it was mostly feminism.

42:30.200 --> 42:32.680
They were very concerned about sexism in the atheist movement.

42:32.680 --> 42:36.400
They started saying that the atheist movement itself was systemically sexist.

42:36.400 --> 42:39.000
There's an old boys club, blah, blah, blah.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.720
It tried to keep women down.

42:40.720 --> 42:47.000
A lot of these people were people who were very just motivated by the activism.

42:47.000 --> 42:51.920
Other ones were very clearly careerist because they were trying to leverage that to get speaking

42:51.920 --> 42:56.800
arrangements and conferences and book deals and things like that.

42:56.800 --> 42:59.100
And many of them succeeded in doing so.

42:59.100 --> 43:05.960
So that by 2011, your typical atheist conference would have lots of panels by kind of these

43:05.960 --> 43:11.520
little activists who mostly their only claim to fame was having a blog.

43:11.520 --> 43:16.240
When I got involved in the atheism movement, my whole first thing was having a blog because

43:16.240 --> 43:17.680
it was all bloggers.

43:17.680 --> 43:23.040
And so you could actually become somebody with a salary, of a sense, in the movement

43:23.040 --> 43:26.200
by having an influential enough blog.

43:26.200 --> 43:29.760
And this kind of social complaining can give you a lot of influence.

43:29.760 --> 43:34.160
So as it pans out, there's this big conference that happens in 2011.

43:34.160 --> 43:40.960
And one of these activists has her panel that she's on and she delivers her talk in her

43:40.960 --> 43:41.960
panel.

43:41.960 --> 43:43.200
Her name's Rebecca Watson.

43:43.200 --> 43:46.240
She goes after the panel later in the day.

43:46.240 --> 43:50.280
She gets in the elevator to go up in the hotel to her room.

43:50.280 --> 43:55.120
Some man gets, I don't know, I think young, but I don't know for sure the details of the

43:55.120 --> 43:59.640
man gets in the elevator at the same time, just by coincidence.

43:59.640 --> 44:04.920
As the elevator's going up, he plucks up the courage, asks her out to coffee, says, I really

44:04.920 --> 44:10.060
liked your panel, would like to know if I could take you to coffee sometime or something

44:10.060 --> 44:11.320
like this.

44:11.320 --> 44:13.120
And the elevator stops at her floor.

44:13.120 --> 44:16.600
She says no, everything, that's it, the end.

44:16.600 --> 44:17.600
He doesn't chase her.

44:17.600 --> 44:20.080
He doesn't come into her room.

44:20.080 --> 44:23.600
He doesn't keep the elevator closed and try to kiss her or something crazy.

44:23.600 --> 44:24.600
Nothing happens.

44:24.600 --> 44:25.600
She said no.

44:25.600 --> 44:26.600
He gets shut down.

44:26.600 --> 44:27.600
He's like, okay.

44:27.600 --> 44:31.760
She gets off the elevator at her floor, goes to her room, immediately turns on her computer,

44:31.760 --> 44:39.560
flips on her video, her webcam and does a video blog about how this is completely inappropriate.

44:39.560 --> 44:42.120
This is sexism in the atheist movement.

44:42.120 --> 44:43.760
This is why the whole thing's sexist.

44:43.760 --> 44:46.240
It makes women like her very uncomfortable.

44:46.240 --> 44:49.360
She's a speaker and then some guy is just going to talk to her in the elevator.

44:49.360 --> 44:51.280
She doesn't know if he's going to rape her.

44:51.280 --> 44:52.560
She's terrified, blah, blah, blah.

44:52.560 --> 44:58.000
The whole kind of overblown, you know, typical reaction that we're all familiar with with

44:58.000 --> 44:59.840
this kind of shit now.

44:59.840 --> 45:08.920
And so this goes kind of viral in the atheist community and maybe it would have died a moderately

45:08.920 --> 45:14.480
quiet death and the big death knell incident would have waited till later.

45:14.480 --> 45:21.760
But then one Richard Dawkins decided to make fun of it publicly and I understand why.

45:21.760 --> 45:26.040
And so he writes this letter called the Dear Muslima Letter talking about how women are

45:26.040 --> 45:31.440
treated under the more brutal interpretations of Islam.

45:31.440 --> 45:36.040
And he's like, but don't worry, you know, Rebecca Watson got asked out in an elevator

45:36.040 --> 45:41.920
or something like, you know, some just perspective blasting snarky thing.

45:41.920 --> 45:47.440
And so this, of course, went absolutely viral because Richard Dawkins wrote it and it was

45:47.440 --> 45:50.140
this huge deal around that.

45:50.140 --> 45:54.480
And so what happens is generally to kind of like take one step back real quick, you're

45:54.480 --> 45:55.640
going to let some diversity in.

45:55.640 --> 45:57.000
That's a good idea.

45:57.000 --> 46:03.200
You start building up the pattern as you start building up a set of sympathies to that worldview

46:03.200 --> 46:07.200
and you start to build up a set of people.

46:07.200 --> 46:11.640
Once it hits 15 to 20 percent of your community, probably even 7 to 8 percent, you're in a

46:11.640 --> 46:13.440
lot of trouble.

46:13.440 --> 46:18.960
And then a precipitating event, in this case, it was Richard Dawkins responding to that

46:18.960 --> 46:24.440
video comes along and it forces now everybody to start taking sides.

46:24.440 --> 46:30.600
And so in a sense in 2011, starting with what was now called Elevator Gate, the Me Too movement

46:30.600 --> 46:35.920
actually started in the atheist movement, but nowhere else.

46:35.920 --> 46:37.720
And it went wildfire.

46:37.720 --> 46:41.520
It was to the point where people were scared to go to atheist conferences at all, lest

46:41.520 --> 46:45.360
they get accused of like hooking up with somebody, even if they didn't do it, maybe they're just

46:45.360 --> 46:46.720
going to get accused.

46:46.720 --> 46:49.280
But men were afraid to go to conferences.

46:49.280 --> 46:53.880
They started leveraging this to get Richard Dawkins isn't allowed to speak at conferences

46:53.880 --> 46:54.880
anymore.

46:54.880 --> 46:55.880
Well, guess what?

46:55.880 --> 46:58.040
People go to conferences to see headliners.

46:58.040 --> 47:02.500
They don't go to see some dork with a blog who's bitching about feminism.

47:02.500 --> 47:09.320
And so the whole architecture of conferences and book deals and all of these things started

47:09.320 --> 47:13.560
to change really rapidly and the whole community polarized around it.

47:13.560 --> 47:18.160
So you had to pick a side and your side was either going to be that you were going to

47:18.160 --> 47:25.600
be a feminist or you were going to be on the side of this patriarchal sexism that characterizes

47:25.600 --> 47:29.760
the true nature of the atheist movement, which has now been revealed because its biggest

47:29.760 --> 47:35.400
leaders have said things like what Richard Dawkins did or Sam Harris got caught out and

47:35.400 --> 47:36.400
so he didn't get caught out.

47:36.400 --> 47:42.400
He had asked some question in a gotcha style, answered with an odd joke that was probably

47:42.400 --> 47:46.040
ill-advised and somehow magically proved his sexism.

47:46.040 --> 47:50.280
So now all the great architects, I mean, Christopher Hitchens had famously written a piece called

47:50.280 --> 47:57.160
Women Aren't Funny and so all of them basically got nuked for being sexist.

47:57.160 --> 47:58.560
The whole program is sexist.

47:58.560 --> 48:01.600
So now we've got to undo systemic sexism.

48:01.600 --> 48:05.920
And then there's this rape culture throughout because some guy asked a woman out in an elevator.

48:05.920 --> 48:09.680
So now there's obviously rape culture and all these guys will hook up and there were

48:09.680 --> 48:16.640
all these powerful, I mean, this is what famous people tend to do is that famous men tend

48:16.640 --> 48:20.180
to have women become very interested in them.

48:20.180 --> 48:23.480
Some of them just want to have sex with the person because they're famous or maybe because

48:23.480 --> 48:26.480
they like them or they're interested or whatever the reasons are.

48:26.480 --> 48:30.580
But some of them see, man, maybe if so and so has sex with me, then he's going to help

48:30.580 --> 48:31.580
my career.

48:31.580 --> 48:35.360
And then a lot of times the man doesn't see it that way, doesn't help her career and all

48:35.360 --> 48:38.840
of a sudden she changed her mind and she was raped or sexually assaulted.

48:38.840 --> 48:44.200
And his power in the, which she was the only one paying attention to it, his power is the

48:44.200 --> 48:48.280
reason that he was able to coerce her into having sex, even though maybe it was her idea

48:48.280 --> 48:49.480
in the first place.

48:49.480 --> 48:51.960
And this actually, this stuff happens all the time.

48:51.960 --> 48:57.800
And so now it became like you couldn't go to conferences, they weren't fun, nothing

48:57.800 --> 48:59.480
interesting was going on.

48:59.480 --> 49:04.080
There were constant squabbles, people getting thrown out, deplatformed, canceled and so

49:04.080 --> 49:05.080
on.

49:05.080 --> 49:07.160
And everybody's afraid they're going to get accused.

49:07.160 --> 49:12.760
So the whole thing melted down and fell apart from within over this by, like I said, four

49:12.760 --> 49:18.320
years later, the thing was a burned out husk of what it used to be.

49:18.320 --> 49:22.900
And so again, I think it gives too much credit to say that the New Atheism Movement came

49:22.900 --> 49:25.000
in and made this happen.

49:25.000 --> 49:28.720
I think that that tracks back a lot longer.

49:28.720 --> 49:34.440
The Enlightenment, this is the consequence of the Enlightenment in some respect.

49:34.440 --> 49:40.040
But the New Atheist Movement, I mean, the decline of religion and thus open space for

49:40.040 --> 49:43.640
things like this is the consequence of the Enlightenment, not this specific thing, because

49:43.640 --> 49:46.480
this is definitely anti-Enlightenment.

49:46.480 --> 49:54.120
But then the New Atheist Movement itself provided a very nurturing spot to incubate one corner

49:54.120 --> 49:59.000
of that movement that then those people no longer having a movement, but having lots

49:59.000 --> 50:03.480
of activity left in them, lots of activism left in them, had to go out and start colonizing

50:03.480 --> 50:07.760
other places and ruining those places too.

50:07.760 --> 50:13.120
And that's, I think, kind of a more comprehensive picture of how that went down.

50:13.120 --> 50:15.120
But it's a model.

50:15.120 --> 50:21.520
It's a model for how this will play out in everything that takes this stuff on.

50:21.520 --> 50:27.000
And first of all, it's fascinating to me that the entire New Atheist Movement was derailed

50:27.000 --> 50:32.400
because of an elevator and a feminist and the whole microcosm of what happened and how

50:32.400 --> 50:35.640
much we can learn from it and people completely ignore what happened.

50:35.640 --> 50:39.760
But the atheism, I didn't know it was called New Atheism back then.

50:39.760 --> 50:44.080
When I came from Iran as a refugee to Canada, it was very attractive to me.

50:44.080 --> 50:46.480
I would call myself a militant atheist.

50:46.480 --> 50:54.120
I listened, you know, I got all of DVDs by the Four Horsemen, Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett,

50:54.120 --> 50:57.700
Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens.

50:57.700 --> 51:03.080
But I started criticizing political Islam because, you know, I'm an ex-Muslim.

51:03.080 --> 51:09.340
I grew up in that country and I know the kind of damage that it causes, beginning with Muslims.

51:09.340 --> 51:13.920
And I started getting attacked by people from that community, people who were atheists.

51:13.920 --> 51:17.280
And I'm like, well, maybe you should also criticize Christianity as much as you're

51:17.280 --> 51:18.880
criticizing Islam.

51:18.880 --> 51:21.800
And then I started getting, you know, attacked more and more and more and more and I was

51:21.800 --> 51:27.160
called a racist and a bigot and all of that.

51:27.160 --> 51:29.600
Of course you were.

51:29.600 --> 51:32.760
So that was happening too, but it wasn't as it wasn't.

51:32.760 --> 51:37.760
It would have eventually, by the way, that would have eventually been a precipitating

51:37.760 --> 51:41.800
event had it not been some feminist thing first or whatever.

51:41.800 --> 51:47.360
And so that's the deal is like this stuff, it will always it's like it's so toxic and

51:47.360 --> 51:51.240
it's so demanding that everybody take one side or the other.

51:51.240 --> 51:52.720
You hear this in the literature all the time.

51:52.720 --> 51:54.880
There's no such thing as a non-racist.

51:54.880 --> 51:57.200
There are only racists and anti-racists.

51:57.200 --> 51:58.560
So you have to pick a side.

51:58.560 --> 52:01.720
Are you on the side of the anti-racist or are you going to be on the side of the racist?

52:01.720 --> 52:03.140
And that's the game that they play.

52:03.140 --> 52:05.560
They put people in these weird positions.

52:05.560 --> 52:10.720
So you get you ended up in the racist position, which is kind of funny.

52:10.720 --> 52:15.560
So you know, we had this guy come to a talk one time, not to divert my point or I'd probably

52:15.560 --> 52:19.680
forget it, but I had this we had this talk in his intersectionality of religion.

52:19.680 --> 52:26.120
And this guy from India was there and professor forgot something, something hard, something

52:26.120 --> 52:27.120
very technical.

52:27.120 --> 52:28.120
Right.

52:28.120 --> 52:29.680
So this guy knows what he's talking about.

52:29.680 --> 52:33.640
And he's coming in and he's he listens to our whole thing and he stands up.

52:33.640 --> 52:37.720
He's like, I want to talk to you guys because I'm very excited and he always got the thickest

52:37.720 --> 52:38.720
possible accent.

52:38.720 --> 52:42.000
I mean, really dark skin, the whole thing.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.840
And he's like, they're accusing me of being a white supremacist.

52:44.840 --> 52:48.160
I don't know why they're accusing me of being a white supremacist.

52:48.160 --> 52:52.520
And it's just like to hear it, you know, super thick accent and everything else is just like

52:52.520 --> 52:55.120
almost hilarious that this is happening.

52:55.120 --> 52:59.160
And it's and it's because, you know, he taught this thing or whatever that supposedly has

52:59.160 --> 53:00.880
some possibly racist application.

53:00.880 --> 53:02.840
But he's like, but it's standard theory.

53:02.840 --> 53:03.840
I don't understand.

53:03.840 --> 53:06.200
And now I'm a white supremacist and all these kids.

53:06.200 --> 53:10.440
And he's like, I'm not even white, you know, and it's just like, OK, but they're the point

53:10.440 --> 53:15.960
I was making is they're the thing is toxic and it forces you to make to take sides.

53:15.960 --> 53:22.000
And there will always eventually be a precipitating event that once there's this in these things,

53:22.000 --> 53:25.080
these tests for these things are happening constantly.

53:25.080 --> 53:32.000
It's once you have a sufficiently large sympathetic community that thinks in these zero sum, like

53:32.000 --> 53:36.960
very Manichaean terms, that's when that's going to happen.

53:36.960 --> 53:41.800
And then sooner or later, an event will either be manufactured if you really want to be cynical

53:41.800 --> 53:45.800
about it or will one will occur eventually anyway, like somebody will ask somebody out

53:45.800 --> 53:50.440
in an elevator and then boom, you know, it's like you've got all this powder and somebody

53:50.440 --> 53:55.960
just set a spark to it and the whole thing blows up and then things are going to always

53:55.960 --> 53:56.960
fall apart.

53:56.960 --> 53:58.000
So there will always be one.

53:58.000 --> 54:02.600
So with the new atheist movement, seeing the way that ex-Muslims were getting treated in

54:02.600 --> 54:05.720
the way that Sam Harris was getting caught, you know, it's gross, it's racist to the very

54:05.720 --> 54:09.240
famous Ben Affleck incident on Bill Maher.

54:09.240 --> 54:14.920
It was only a matter of time if feminism didn't blow it up that it being allegedly racist

54:14.920 --> 54:17.560
to criticize Islam was going to be the thing.

54:17.560 --> 54:19.600
That was the other hot button issue there.

54:19.600 --> 54:23.120
It wasn't like, you know, the typical American black white racism thing.

54:23.120 --> 54:29.440
It was definitely the white versus, or even not even white, but like American or Western

54:29.440 --> 54:36.320
view versus, I should say, versus Islam, which that's covered under post-colonial theory

54:36.320 --> 54:41.400
more than it is under the other ones, but utterly forbidden.

54:41.400 --> 54:47.120
So that would have been, the same fate was happening sooner or later anyway, and that

54:47.120 --> 54:51.360
would have been the thing if it wasn't feminism or if it wasn't something else first.

54:51.360 --> 55:00.280
It just so happened that it was this idiotic feminist thing that just because somebody

55:00.280 --> 55:04.920
gave it the attention it needed to become a wildfire, it became a wildfire.

55:04.920 --> 55:10.600
But you can't ignore it either because if you ignore it, that's how it's growing sympathies.

55:10.600 --> 55:16.280
Maybe the silver lining is that because how awful this tribe of irrational fundamentalists

55:16.280 --> 55:20.360
are bringing everybody else together against them.

55:20.360 --> 55:23.480
Can that be considered as a silver lining or there is no silver lining?

55:23.480 --> 55:26.840
I don't know if there's a silver lining.

55:26.840 --> 55:34.200
I mean, it does help actually for people to see that this really is a fundamentalist religious

55:34.200 --> 55:35.200
type thing.

55:35.200 --> 55:40.560
I had actually somebody send me a direct message on Twitter earlier, who's also from Iran.

55:40.560 --> 55:45.600
And he was talking, he's like, it's killing me to watch, he was talking about something

55:45.600 --> 55:53.960
in medicine, to watch exactly the same kind of theocratic nonsense, brainwashing taking

55:53.960 --> 55:59.640
place even not just in the West, but in sciences like medicine and to watch people do the same

55:59.640 --> 56:02.680
kinds of contortions that they did to defend religion.

56:02.680 --> 56:06.400
He's like, I left Iran because I wanted to get away from this.

56:06.400 --> 56:11.200
And now he's like, I never in my life thought that not only would I see it in the West,

56:11.200 --> 56:15.280
but that I see it in medicine, in a science.

56:15.280 --> 56:21.160
And then at the same time, I get messages constantly from people who escaped some place,

56:21.160 --> 56:26.960
whether it's they or their parents escaped China during Mao or whether it's somebody

56:26.960 --> 56:33.000
whose family escaped Cuba, whether it's somebody who escaped Hungary or lived through Hungary.

56:33.000 --> 56:37.360
And it was communists or people who were in the Soviet Union or who are in East Germany

56:37.360 --> 56:39.400
or any of these kinds of stories.

56:39.400 --> 56:43.080
I get stuff all the time from these people are like, what's happening?

56:43.080 --> 56:49.080
We got out of, they say communism and communism is happening again.

56:49.080 --> 56:54.440
And here where we came for safety, and it's just like really a shocking phenomenon to

56:54.440 --> 57:02.980
hear it so regularly compared to both communism and theocracy by people who lived in regime

57:02.980 --> 57:03.980
regimes.

57:03.980 --> 57:06.360
It's just a shocking thing.

57:06.360 --> 57:12.920
And the fact that people seem just so asleep to the problem.

57:12.920 --> 57:15.800
I don't mean that I hate that whole wake up thing.

57:15.800 --> 57:16.800
Wake up sheeple.

57:16.800 --> 57:17.800
I hate that.

57:17.800 --> 57:18.800
Me too.

57:18.800 --> 57:19.800
I don't even know what that means.

57:19.800 --> 57:20.800
Wake up to what?

57:20.800 --> 57:21.800
To do what?

57:21.800 --> 57:22.800
Yeah.

57:22.800 --> 57:28.320
It's become aware is what it really means and become an activist, of course.

57:28.320 --> 57:32.600
So I don't want that to be the case, but it's like people really do have to understand

57:32.600 --> 57:40.760
that this isn't this benign thing that's fighting for human rights or human betterment.

57:40.760 --> 57:42.160
It's really something different.

57:42.160 --> 57:49.080
And when the people who have escaped theocracies, repressive theocracies, and people who have

57:49.080 --> 57:57.160
escaped literal communist regimes that were brutal and awful are saying, stop, stop, stop.

57:57.160 --> 57:58.160
What are you doing?

57:58.160 --> 57:59.160
You're making the same mistakes.

57:59.160 --> 58:04.020
At some point, you've really got to open your eyes and think, wait a minute.

58:04.020 --> 58:07.240
Maybe this isn't just some silly college kids yelling.

58:07.240 --> 58:09.640
Maybe something really bad is happening.

58:09.640 --> 58:14.560
Not to get too dramatic about it, but the Red Guard in China, which was one of the ways

58:14.560 --> 58:23.600
that Mao seized most of his power in his second big bid was after the Great Leap Forward failed.

58:23.600 --> 58:28.160
The Red Guard was a bunch of college kids yelling and whining.

58:28.160 --> 58:29.320
That's what they were.

58:29.320 --> 58:35.440
And so it's like, open your eyes, you know, this is actually serious.

58:35.440 --> 58:37.080
This is threatening stuff.

58:37.080 --> 58:38.080
Yeah.

58:38.080 --> 58:39.480
I wish we had more time.

58:39.480 --> 58:42.280
We could talk a little more about China, but I know your time is limited.

58:42.280 --> 58:44.800
I want to talk about mathematics.

58:44.800 --> 58:46.240
You have a PhD in mathematics.

58:46.240 --> 58:49.520
Do you think mathematics was invented or discovered?

58:49.520 --> 58:50.520
Both.

58:50.520 --> 58:51.520
Both.

58:51.520 --> 59:03.560
I have a very not common view about the ontology of mathematics.

59:03.560 --> 59:09.360
My philosophy of mathematics is I don't know if it's unique, but I've not read much of

59:09.360 --> 59:10.360
it.

59:10.360 --> 59:16.400
So I fundamentally think that mathematics is empirical.

59:16.400 --> 59:22.120
It all starts with numbers and our numbers start by counting things and seeing what happens

59:22.120 --> 59:24.040
when we count things.

59:24.040 --> 59:33.160
So what we call a single unit, one, is definable once we define a unit of what.

59:33.160 --> 59:39.680
And so we have this idea of one that is one of any particular unit that you might choose.

59:39.680 --> 59:44.120
And then you can see what happens if you take one and then you take a second one and you

59:44.120 --> 59:45.120
put them together.

59:45.120 --> 59:49.440
In other words, you can add and you see that you end up with what we define to be two units

59:49.440 --> 59:51.080
and then three units and so on.

59:51.080 --> 59:55.640
And you could do experiments, although they would be very boring, about what happens if

59:55.640 --> 59:56.640
you multiply.

59:56.640 --> 01:00:01.880
So what happens if I take, say, five units of this and put it this way and six units

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:03.800
of that and put it that way and make a grid?

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:10.080
I'm always going to end up with 30 total units and some multiplication comes out.

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:15.440
So the very fundamentals of number theory are, in my opinion, likely to be empirical.

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:19.480
And then they were axiomatized, they became a logical system.

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:27.360
And then that logical system, because the axioms are so easily agreed upon when you're

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:36.120
talking about relatively simple ones, like there is a number zero or one, whichever one

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:37.120
you want.

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:41.520
And if you add one to it, there's this idea of a successor, then you can start to predict

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:43.400
what other axioms might be.

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:46.720
And that's where you can start getting into the really abstract stuff, like being able

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:50.040
to take one and add one again and add one again and add one again.

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:55.880
In principle, indefinitely gives you this idea of what the infinite might be.

01:00:55.880 --> 01:01:00.360
It turns out you can't get to the infinite within basic number theory axioms.

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:03.760
So you have to add a new axiom called the axiom of infinity, but you can decide what

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:06.100
that axiom is going to be in a pretty clear way.

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:10.120
And then all of the rest of it just starts falling out.

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:17.960
So in a sense, what you have is you have this discovery, which is to see how numbers work

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:21.320
when you actually manipulate numbers of things.

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:23.000
So that's discover.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.040
And then this is going to go on three levels.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:33.120
The second level is that you start to formalize it as the language goes and make these abstract

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:40.880
mathematical formalisms, which we later learned, thanks to Gödel, are known as axiomatic systems.

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:45.920
And then the axiomatic system is something that we invent.

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:51.120
And then once you've laid down the axiomatic system, you've now created within abstract

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:58.540
space but not real space, a very large number of true statements, in fact, an infinite number

01:01:58.540 --> 01:01:59.540
of true statements.

01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:04.400
So there are lots and lots and lots of true statements that are interesting.

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:09.000
And you can then discover those truths within the abstract space.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.300
So it's like one step away from reality.

01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:18.360
Now why are they so heavily coordinated with what we see in reality when we look back out

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:20.040
of abstract space into reality space?

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.520
Well, it's because it was fundamentally empirical in the first place.

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:30.380
We started with very easily agreed upon self-evident axioms, created a philosophy that we call

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:38.720
a mathematics out of those axioms, and then discover truths within it as an abstract exercise.

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:44.640
And then those reflect back very accurately on reality because it's a very tight-knit

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:45.640
philosophy.

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:51.600
It's a very, very tight-knit philosophy with mostly very basic, easily agreed upon so-called

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:56.080
self-evident axioms that there's not a lot of wiggle room or argument to have about them.

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:59.160
So I have a very different view of mathematics.

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:01.920
Is it discovered or is it invented?

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:06.400
Depends on technically what you mean by mathematics, but the axioms of mathematics are fundamentally

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:14.400
… the basic ones are fundamentally discovered … or sorry, yeah, they're empirical, they're

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:15.400
discovered.

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:20.640
Then there's an entire axiomatic formal system that's invented to service those axioms,

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:24.160
which is called just that axiomatic system.

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:27.240
There are truths to be discovered within that on a … I don't want to say a different

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:33.280
plane of existence, but it's within abstract space, not within reality space.

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.280
So both.

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:35.280
I just find it very …

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:40.080
I don't think most people think … Nobody thinks clearly about this stuff.

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:41.720
I read so many things about this.

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:42.720
It gets so frustrating.

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:45.220
It's so, to me, muddle-headed.

01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:52.160
Even really brilliant guys like Max Tegmark … I mean, totally a brilliant guy.

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:56.080
I don't think I'm in his league, but I read his beliefs that reality is mathematics, and

01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:58.880
I'm just like, what the hell are you talking about?

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:02.960
How would you define reality?

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:08.000
I would say reality is what's out there.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:17.640
Reality is that which is, that's independent of any observer in any meaningful sense.

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:22.900
It's objective or subjective, the experience of reality that we are having.

01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:26.480
The experience of reality is necessarily subjective.

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:28.600
Reality itself is objective.

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:32.920
We have a variety of methods that we refer to under the term objectivity that allow us

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:37.720
to approximate … I don't want to say approximate.

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:42.680
I want to say it allows us to make statements about objective reality, which we don't

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:46.840
have any total access to.

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:55.400
But those statements are so likely to be reflective of what really happens that we can place bets

01:04:55.400 --> 01:05:01.520
on them and win with not only high levels of confidence in some cases, but with measurable

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:05.800
levels of confidence in all cases.

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:10.920
What's really interesting to me is based on this inherent subjective experience of

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:14.560
reality that we are having, if you want to think about the concept of a higher power,

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:20.740
a higher being, or God, which to me is a placeholder, we're just using these terms without really

01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:25.640
understanding them, love is another one, consciousness is another one, waking up people is another

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:28.320
one, we just throw these things around.

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:34.520
But would it be fair to say that a concept of a God or a higher being is inherently for

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:39.920
humans unknowable because it is everything and anything that has any kind of an experience

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:42.560
in the universal and beyond that scale?

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:45.080
I mean, yeah.

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:50.920
If you want to use the word God to describe that which is beyond one's own capacity

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:57.680
for comprehension or that which is beyond even society's total capacity for comprehension,

01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:58.680
I'm okay with that.

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:05.960
I have a friend who sometimes calls it God and sometimes uses the phrase infinity point,

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:09.720
which it's interesting that he was calling it that because he didn't really know the

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:13.120
math but I actually talked about this a long time ago.

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:19.600
When we have an infinite set like the numbers, one, two, three, dot, dot, dot, right?

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:24.520
When you have an infinite set, we have this concept that it's infinite, but you can't

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.960
actually know that it's infinite.

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:30.280
In fact, no matter how many numbers you list, we get one, two, three, four, five, six, we

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:34.200
could count for a long time and then eventually you still have to put dot, dot, dot.

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:36.160
That dot, dot, dot is the infinity point.

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:41.400
It's the point where if you look at numbers, we hit a point where we don't even have ways

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.000
to name the numbers anymore.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.920
We don't know how to say them, right?

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.880
There is no language for the numbers.

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:52.680
You could technically, if you had time, write it down, but there's no language for it.

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:57.560
We have what, million, billion, trillion, quadrillion, pentillion and you can go on

01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:00.640
and on but eventually you run out of terms.

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:03.880
Then you actually get to the point where you physically couldn't write the numbers down

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:07.720
and still it turns out all infinity of the numbers are still on the other side of that,

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:08.720
right?

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:09.720
In the dot, dot, dot.

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:13.080
So the infinity point, calling it the infinity point where you just have to punt and say,

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:16.600
well, there's infinitely more.

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:19.400
My friend sometimes identifies that with God, right?

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:23.000
I don't know that that's a great metaphor, but it does help.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:29.400
It's very much more Spinoza's God than it is like Christian God or Islamic God or even

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:32.720
a Hindu God or any of these other kinds of deities.

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:40.120
It's this idea that there's more out there than we can possibly grasp and I really mean

01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:42.200
that when I say it with infinity point.

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:45.760
We cannot possibly grasp or write down those numbers.

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.640
We cannot possibly name them.

01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:53.200
I mean that with absolute, like not even sincerity, but that is absolutely true.

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:58.520
And that's because of our limits of comprehension and cognition, right?

01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:00.800
No, it even goes beyond that.

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.560
It's also beyond the limits.

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:06.760
If you're talking about infinity, it's beyond the limits of physical reality.

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:11.220
You take all of the possible quantum states possible in the observable universe and there's

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:16.160
only so many and then infinite more numbers are bigger than that, right?

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:17.640
And so there's only so many.

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:24.520
So there's some point where you just have to put dot dot dot and all the magic is happening

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:27.160
in those three dots.

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:32.360
And so within a human though it is, it is our comprehension whether that's individually

01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:40.780
within our group of peers or our society or humanity as a whole.

01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:44.120
Different levels of course have different kind of ways of looking at knowledge.

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:47.840
But there is this point where it's like, well, it's not that we don't know, it's that we

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:50.180
actually can't know.

01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:53.800
And it's you can call that, you know, kind of Spinoza's God.

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:58.880
It's when I said to him, so how do you define reality, I said it's what's out there.

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:01.520
It's what's out there beyond like this.

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:07.440
You could call God what's out there beyond what we can know is out there.

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:16.360
And fine, but I think it's a bad metaphor because so many different religions are comfortable

01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:21.740
using that to say, see, everybody believes in God.

01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:26.560
But then the thing that they mean, my God, most people in the world, by definition, human

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:33.120
definition of God, nobody believes in, not nobody, I'm sorry.

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:35.540
Most people don't believe in any given God.

01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:39.560
You pick your favorite God in all of human history, most people haven't believed in it.

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:43.680
Doesn't matter which one it is, Christianity or Islam, you know, we're talking between

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:47.720
them will say it's the same God, you got something like three and change billion people believing

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:48.720
in it.

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:52.220
That leaves four and change billion people who don't right now.

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:55.760
So it's not how that works.

01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:00.040
Most people don't believe in any given God.

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:01.580
So you have to be careful.

01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:07.360
My argument since like 2014 or so around that has been, look, if you want to call that God,

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:14.000
fine, but you better be ready to acknowledge what you're saying God is, you know, and you've

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:19.440
got to be careful because it allows people who are being a little less scrupulous with

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:24.280
the definitions to play a bait and switch game and say, ah, see, you believe in God,

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:25.960
you're an atheist and you believe in God.

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:32.080
And what you mean is this like very abstract kind of what I can't know that which is beyond

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:39.160
me, that which is always bigger than me, that which is inherently beyond my control and

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:45.440
a belief that it works out or something as much of the time that all that stuff is not

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:48.760
the same thing as, you know, what you read about in the Old Testament.

01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:50.120
No, it's just not the same thing.

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:51.120
Absolutely.

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:57.560
The gods of Old Testament and Quran and the human God has been, to me, created for the

01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:03.440
sake of power, capitalize on it for power, the way that Christianity became the unity

01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:06.520
of church and state to get into politics.

01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:13.160
It has nothing to do with what, for example, mystics and Sufis or, you know, if you meditate

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:17.780
or whatever it is that you want to do, or if you want to focus on philosophical aspect

01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:19.560
of artificial intelligence.

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:24.120
That was one of the reasons that I asked, is it by nature unknowable, the infinity that

01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:25.120
you're talking about?

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:29.560
Because some of the argument is that, well, maybe if we have a higher cognition ability

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:33.820
in a form of whether artificial general intelligence or something beyond that, beyond the point

01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:36.780
of singularity, then that can't be known.

01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:39.840
But you were saying that it's unknowable by nature.

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:40.960
There's always an unknowable.

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:43.780
There's actually a short story and I'm trying to think of who it's by.

01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:51.760
It's one of the very famous writers, I cannot think of who it's by, but it's, somebody will

01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:55.240
be able to figure it out and tell us at some point.

01:11:55.240 --> 01:12:00.560
But it talks about, it's essentially that they built this AI machine and they ask it

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:05.080
the same question over and over again, like what is the nature of reality or whatever.

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:10.520
And it's trying to compute and it says, you know, insufficient data or whatever.

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:15.160
And then the machine gets upgraded to an even more powerful machine and it talks at each

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:19.800
stage, like there's five or six stages, about how incredibly powerful it is now and how

01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:25.160
incredibly, like the hard, hard questions it can answer that are just unbelievably complicated.

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:30.200
And it's like, you know, it keeps going stage after stage and then it gets asked, you know,

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:32.400
what is the ultimate nature of reality or whatever.

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:38.240
And it's like, you know, more data needed, can't compute.

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:45.680
And then it says that by the time that it finally, you know, becomes like AGI would,

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:49.500
it has the ability to build itself and to marshal resources to its own calculational

01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:50.840
powers and everything.

01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:55.240
And so it takes it out basically to the heat death of the universe and it has gathered

01:12:55.240 --> 01:13:00.280
all possible information to itself.

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:04.060
And the question is posed, you know, what's the ultimate nature of reality?

01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:08.360
And it's now got the, it literally is the only thing in the universe, right?

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:10.640
It's become the entire universe.

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:13.560
And it says, let there be light.

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:16.560
Oh, that's amazing.

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:20.480
This is by one of the big writers, Asimov or something like that, right?

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:21.480
It's really worth reading.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:22.480
It takes like 20 minutes.

01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:31.160
I think it was Asimov that wrote it, but, so even if you had this super intelligent

01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:35.760
artificial intelligence, the infinity point still exists.

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:38.480
Infinity really is infinity.

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:43.480
There's a funny saying that people who study mathematics learn, which is that all numbers

01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:45.900
are smaller than most.

01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:49.760
And so it doesn't matter how many numbers, how, you know, whatever number you think is

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:55.000
a big number, immediately I can say, well, think of a number 10 times that big, right?

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.360
And your number is not that big of a number.

01:13:56.360 --> 01:14:01.080
Or I could say, think of a number a trillion times that big and your number is now very

01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:02.080
small.

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:05.680
And, you know, and you, of course a trillion was also very small, so you can start thinking

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:10.240
about how that stacks up and multiplies on itself to the point where it becomes very

01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:15.600
quick to understand that all numbers are in fact very small compared to most numbers,

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:20.520
which all live in the dot, dot, dot to infinity.

01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:23.320
And that's a limitation of physical reality.

01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:27.840
So no artificial intelligence could surpass that.

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:30.440
So there's always an unknowable.

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:35.800
There's always an unknowable and there's always a bigger than whatever.

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:36.800
Even in the story.

01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:41.920
And like I said, I'm almost sure it's Asimov now, but I'm not gonna, I wouldn't bet anything

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:42.920
on it.

01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:43.920
We'll confirm.

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:44.920
Yeah.

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:45.920
We'll confirm that.

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:51.240
In that story, it literally takes all the way until it has every conceivable resource

01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:58.400
of the whole universe dedicated to its computational task, at which point it becomes God and starts

01:14:58.400 --> 01:14:59.400
the universe over.

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:00.400
Wow.

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:01.400
That was amazing.

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:02.400
That was awesome.

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.400
It's a pretty cool story.

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:05.400
Very.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:06.400
Yeah.

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:07.400
Very.

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:09.160
I have to think even more about it.

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:12.160
Let's wrap this up since you have stuff to do.

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:16.240
What's next for you and where can our audience follow your work?

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:18.280
Well, the follow is easy.

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:19.280
So I'll say that first.

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:25.960
You can find me on Twitter at Conceptual James and I have a website that's NewDiscourses.com

01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:30.800
and it's kind of a repository for pretty much everything that I'm doing.

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:35.200
And also it answers the other question, what's next for me?

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:36.600
Most of what's next is there.

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:43.720
I do have a book coming out on August, I think, 25th, Pandemic, depending, called Cynical

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:49.040
Theories written with Helen Pluckrose that traces the postmodern elements of social justice

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:53.520
theory and explains how it is an evolution of postmodernism that we're dealing with

01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:56.400
in the woke movement today.

01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:03.840
But on New Discourses, I'm trying to, I'm literally trying to lay out a comprehensive

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:09.040
picture of as much of that movement as I possibly can going into rather tremendous levels of

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.040
depth.

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:16.680
And I'm primarily spending my time writing what I've called social justice encyclopedia.

01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:22.080
So it focuses not on all the topics relevant to social justice, but just on the terminology.

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:25.800
So I'm trying to explain the way that they use words and the way that their mindset is

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:29.560
rooted in the way that they use words and make it very, very clear.

01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:36.880
When they say such and such was a racist incident or we need diversity or whatever, or as we

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:41.960
talked about earlier, non-consensual co-platforming, what in the world does this stuff really mean?

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:45.200
So I'm trying to build that out.

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:48.520
It's going to take me the better part of another year, year and a half to finish it, but there

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:54.720
is a metric ton of useful information there now.

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:56.040
People are reporting to me all the time.

01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:59.640
For example, they get in these discussions or arguments or whatever they get into online

01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:04.960
or they see these posts that people make and are like, oh, blah, blah, blah, diversity

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:10.960
initiative, and then they can go to my encyclopedia to where I've defined the term diversity,

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:14.980
and they can just take it and post, well, that term means more than what most people

01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:15.980
understand it to mean.

01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:19.960
This is a pretty comprehensive summary, and they post the link to the encyclopedia so

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:21.440
people can understand it.

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:28.320
My goal, by the way, with that is and always has been to make sure, look, maybe social

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.240
justice, I don't think it's right.

01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:34.520
I think it's a catastrophe, but what I think doesn't matter because I'm a person and I

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:36.400
mess up.

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:40.200
I think that people should be able to make a decision about social justice, but they

01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:44.920
should have to make the decision informed rather than uninformed, or ideally they should

01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:50.000
be making a decision in an informed capacity rather than an uninformed capacity.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.800
My feeling is that the movement is selling itself as one thing when it's actually something

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:59.740
very different, and if people understood it better, they could make a better decision

01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:00.960
about what they would want to do with it.

01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:07.480
I think most people, overwhelmingly most people, north of 90% of people would agree with me

01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:12.620
that implementing social justice as the movement is pushing it is a bad idea.

01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:15.200
Social justice as a concept is a different thing.

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:18.520
You can read about that on the encyclopedia too.

01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:22.080
I think most people would reject it if they understood it, so I'm trying to help people

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:23.080
understand it.

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:24.080
That's awesome.

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:27.200
I hope I can have you back on the show when your book is out.

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:29.200
We talk a little more about that.

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:30.360
Let me ask you the last question.

01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:36.160
I ask all my guests that if you come across an intelligent alien from a different civilization,

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:40.440
what would you say is the worst thing humanity has done, and what would you say is our greatest

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:44.720
achievement?

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:48.560
That is a hard question.

01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:52.000
Those are really, really hard questions.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:19:02.160
I would honestly say that our greatest achievement, that one's easier, was the recognition of

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:05.880
fundamentally liberal principles, and I mean this in a very specific way.

01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:12.880
I see liberalism as a means of conflict management that tries to minimize subjective influence

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:19.120
because everybody has self-interest involved in their perspectives on conflict.

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:24.320
The attempt to make our conflict management, whether it's in knowledge, whether it's

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:29.960
in law, whether it's in other arenas, as objective as possible, which isn't to say perfectly

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:36.160
objective, has probably been humanity's greatest achievement.

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:41.920
It's no small thing to have arrived there.

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:48.760
I don't know what humanity's greatest error would be, but if I had to try to talk in kind

01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:55.840
of blurry lines about it, it would be that we were unable to realize until we really

01:19:55.840 --> 01:20:04.080
messed it up that global conquest is not good.

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:10.520
The idea that going to take over other territory and call it your own by force or by other

01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:17.240
kind of seditious methods is really not good.

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:23.680
That is a huge, huge thing that I think of, to be honest with you, I think of World War

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:30.120
II, and the story of this isn't actually over, but I think of World War II as the West's

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:42.200
coming to terms with the fact that the colonial or imperial project is not compatible with

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:44.400
advanced technology.

01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:49.000
That's why I get really worried when I see nations right now, such as China, which are

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:55.000
blatantly colonizing, because they haven't seemed to have learned the lesson.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:04.560
The big lesson there was definitely that colonizing the other territory, especially by force,

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:08.840
is not compatible with a society that develops advanced technology.

01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:13.240
I guess if you're going around with horses and bows and arrows, maybe it's one story,

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:20.640
but when you have tanks and aircraft and nuclear weapons, it's another story altogether.

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:26.120
I would say that the greatest triumph then is the development of fundamentally liberal

01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:33.640
principles and the greatest failure is the belief that which one can take for their own

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:34.640
is their own.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:22:01.280
Of course, those two things are at odds.
