1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
somebody like AOC saying it's more important to be morally correct than factually correct

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,540
or morally right than factually correct or however the exact phrasing goes, that's actually

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,540
the same thing.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,720
It's this appealing back to these immature models that suit our intuitions, our moral

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:19,140
feelings about things, rather than trying to actually understand the world.

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:30,720
And that is actually a catastrophe when you live in an advanced democracy, in an advanced

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,000
world.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,880
Hello and welcome to the 76th episode of A New Human Podcast.

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,760
I'm a Gabbahari edigologist on Twitter and Instagram, and you can follow this show on

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,260
LiveInLimbo.com, iTunes, YouTube, BitChute, and soon on Spotify.

11
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,040
And today with me, I have the pleasure of having James Lindsay.

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,520
Welcome to New Human Podcast, James.

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,520
Thanks for having me.

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,520
Absolutely.

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,680
Let's start with your background, the work you've done, the lives you've lived, and what

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,320
do you mainly focus on now these days?

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,640
Oh, God.

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,020
So my background, I guess it's relevant to mention that I have a doctorate in mathematics,

19
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,520
but I don't do mathematics.

20
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,320
And I've not done mathematics professionally in 10 years.

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,720
So that kind of places me educationally, but maybe sort of professionally.

22
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:33,200
So what happened from finishing my doctorate and then leaving academia, I started to get

23
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,860
into kind of this independent vein of research around religion and ultimately mostly psychology

24
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,920
related to religion.

25
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,240
That developed for a number of years.

26
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,080
I was involved in what would have been called the New Atheist Movement.

27
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:53,600
And I kind of watched that get eaten from the inside by social justice, if you will.

28
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:01,080
And my attentions turned to that as that was unfolding in front of me.

29
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:07,480
I would say that if I had a consistent theme in life that's kind of driven me is that I

30
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,280
can't stand stupidness and unfairness.

31
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,520
And so that was exhibiting both.

32
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,800
So I felt like I had to say something about it and understand it and try to do something

33
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
with it.

34
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,040
And then I became something of a figure by my participation in what has come to be known

35
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,400
as the Grievance Studies Affair.

36
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:36,920
So I don't know if your listeners know what that is, but in 2017 and 18, I with two colleagues

37
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:45,720
who are named Peter Boghossian and Helen Pluckrose wrote a series of kind of quality assurance

38
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:52,340
testing of bogus academic papers that targeted fields like gender studies, which we summarized

39
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,080
under the heading Grievance Studies.

40
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:02,920
And we actually wrote 20 of them and we submitted them to the highest standing academic journals

41
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:10,160
that were within scope of what we were arguing and seven of those were accepted for publication.

42
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,040
Four of them were actually published.

43
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,480
One of them won an award for excellence.

44
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,420
Seven more were still under peer review.

45
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,720
Some of them were rather favorable reviews.

46
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:27,120
When the Wall Street Journal published an expose of what we were doing having been caught

47
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,180
out in the middle of it and not getting to wrap it up.

48
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,480
And so since then, I've been studying this material really deeply.

49
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,720
I've written a book with Peter Boghossian about how to have impossible conversations,

50
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:47,880
that's the title of it, to figure out how to talk to people with whom we don't agree.

51
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,980
And then I have written a book with the other of my colleagues, Helen Pluckrose, diving

52
00:03:52,980 --> 00:04:00,240
more deeply into the academic theory that has put the legs underneath social justice scholarship.

53
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:06,520
It's not exactly a book that explains how we did the fake papers project, but it does

54
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:12,080
explain the theory in which we were using it or an aspect of the theory.

55
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,800
In particular, it traces its postmodern roots.

56
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:22,040
So that book's called Cynical Theories and it comes out in August or after the pandemic

57
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,560
kind of more vaguely depending on what happens with the book industry.

58
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:33,040
And so I also started a website called New Discourses and it's kind of a platform for

59
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,160
educational resources.

60
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,000
My goal is to help people understand kind of the crazy currents in society.

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,600
So I've studied, for example, social justice theory rather deeply now.

62
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,760
I can understand it.

63
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,320
I can actually think kind of it's like, you know, when people learn other languages, they

64
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,840
say that there's this point you cross where you can dream in another language.

65
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,320
I can do that with the social justice mentality.

66
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,160
And so I'm trying to explain it and other related phenomena.

67
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,080
And I'm, you know, open to explaining other things that are kind of failures of communication

68
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,760
and sense making on the platform.

69
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,400
So that's what I've been up to.

70
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
That's who I am.

71
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,760
I had Peter on a podcast, Peter Boghossian, for the book, How to Have Impossible Conversations

72
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,440
and I found it interesting that the summary of our conversation was that, well, you must

73
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,120
be willing to have a conversation at first in order to learn how to have impossible conversations.

74
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,600
And it seems like such an impossible task to talk to these social justice people because

75
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,700
they're coming from the place of faith rather than reason and conversation.

76
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,240
Have you felt it the same way?

77
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,240
Yeah.

78
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,480
I mean, there's actually multiple levels upon which that's a problem.

79
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,320
One of those is that you're right.

80
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,040
They're coming from something that's much more a position of faith than it is from reason.

81
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,480
Secondly, the amount of, I mean, they've kind of, on one level, they've kind of given up

82
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:03,120
on having conversation because they occupy a completely different understanding of everything

83
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,120
in the world.

84
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,160
It's very difficult to communicate that and I sound crazy when I say it, but it's true.

85
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,000
They have a completely different theory of what a person is.

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,520
It started with the personal is the political and it's now arrived at a person is their

87
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,520
politics.

88
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,520
So if you don't understand that, you're just going to talk past them.

89
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,560
They have their own theory of mind, theory of agency, theory of knowledge, theory of

90
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,360
ethics.

91
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,960
They've got their kind of an entire, I said to somebody the other day, in fact, that to

92
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:39,800
call it a religion misses the full scope of how radically different a way of thinking

93
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,520
a fundamentalist religion maybe would be a better kind of a description, right?

94
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,360
It's a fundamentalist religion indeed.

95
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,360
Yes.

96
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,280
And I can defend that, you know, rooted in the literature about what a fundamentalist

97
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:58,280
religion is, but it's also, it's an, it's an entire culture that has it.

98
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,740
It's like, you know, you talk about the subculture or whatever.

99
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,680
It's no longer a subculture, but it is a completely different culture that understands the world

100
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,640
in a completely different way on almost every conceivable level.

101
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,800
And the third reason, so that they've shied away from conversation is the second reason

102
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,080
here because all the conversations are just people talking past each other and they tell

103
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,800
you over and over again that they're exhausted.

104
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,320
I don't want to have to have this conversation.

105
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,400
It's not my job to educate you, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

106
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
They've had it.

107
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,920
They tried it for a couple of years and it didn't work and they gave up.

108
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,160
So they're just going to browbeat people now because it's a moral conversation which places

109
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,400
it in the world of faith in a sense.

110
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,880
And then the third reason is that they actually, because they have this weird view about power

111
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:43,560
structures and the weird view about how language is relevant to power structures and association

112
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,480
is relevant to power structures.

113
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:51,120
They have this really weird view that the dialogue in fact is dangerous.

114
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,420
The dialogue itself is part of the problem.

115
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:59,720
So they have concepts like, well, I mean, just to talk about dialogue being dangerous

116
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,480
that has pretty deep roots, but they even have concepts like what's called non-consensual

117
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:10,720
co-platforming which means that, for example, if some social justice person published an

118
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,360
article in say New York Times Opinion and then later I published an article critical

119
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,800
of social justice things in New York Times Opinion because it's the same venue, the New

120
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,800
York Times Opinion editors have now non-consensually, because they didn't ask the social justice

121
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,320
person's permission to publish me, they have non-consensually co-platformed us, put us

122
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:37,800
in the same outlet and therefore they become guilty and complicit in the problem or whatever

123
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,800
that the social justice person is fighting.

124
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,800
Facilitating this rape.

125
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,840
Yeah.

126
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
It's pretty much like that.

127
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:48,640
And so they are actually not just exhausted of conversation, they're actually hostile

128
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,900
to the idea of conversation because they believe that it perpetuates the problematic discourses.

129
00:08:54,900 --> 00:09:00,960
It perpetuates the power structures in society to even have dialogue.

130
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,880
Their agenda is to, they have a different worldview and it is to utterly destroy the

131
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,160
previous worldview, the one that most of us still operate within.

132
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,200
So this alternate universe that they've created, this must have been built upon bunch of texts

133
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,760
and bunch of opinions and bunch of worldviews and perspective coming mainly, which is what

134
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,040
I learned from Peter, mainly from academia, right?

135
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,080
So what has happened there?

136
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:33,320
How all of this could have evolved in a way, this unreasonable course of action could have

137
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,280
evolved within academia that's supposed to be a free platform for discourse and debates

138
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,080
and conversation to the point that as you're saying, it's not a subculture anymore.

139
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,280
It's an alternative culture that can very well threaten the rest of us who, you know,

140
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,640
they're not even willing to talk to us.

141
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,520
Do you want the short answer?

142
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:59,400
I mean, I think it's really important to understand where does this come from that it all came

143
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,880
from feminism.

144
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,680
I can almost, not quite all from feminism, but and you know, this is a very long and

145
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,400
complicated story depending on how we want to tell it, but how did it actually make its

146
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:17,600
way into academia was primarily during the 1960s, but also going into the 1970s was this

147
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:24,280
transition that was beginning in mostly English literature departments where you started to

148
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:30,760
have, you know, mostly women doing feminism and occasionally you'd have, of course up

149
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:38,440
until the 1960s, you would not have had say black professors or other in America racial

150
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,720
minority professors being hired, but the university started to correct for this.

151
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,240
They started to desegregate and integrate and so on, and they started bringing in faculty

152
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,620
members of other races.

153
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:54,080
And so some of these, again, mostly in English literature departments started to do things

154
00:10:54,080 --> 00:11:01,120
like women's studies, feminist studies, ethnic studies, African-American studies.

155
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,340
And some of that's like, you know, obviously legit.

156
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,120
If you want to look into that, you want to like say you're a literature professor and

157
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,040
you want to focus on African-American literature or something like that, there's every reason

158
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,960
to think that that's an interesting project.

159
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:20,080
But because in particular with feminism, though it was in various degrees in all of this,

160
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:25,840
the goal in feminism was very blatantly, very activist from the beginning.

161
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,000
And they didn't have the, you know, a robust corpus of academic literature.

162
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,600
So they kind of had to manufacture one on the spot and they started to build one.

163
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,880
And more or less, the rest of the academy sort of turned a blind eye.

164
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:43,880
So what actually happened was that universities started to allow these feminist literature

165
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:49,640
professors to have feminist departments like women's studies, which went on to become gender

166
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,760
studies, occasionally but very rarely feminist studies.

167
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,640
It's much more commonly women's studies.

168
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,920
And so they started creating these alternative departments and staffing them with what turned

169
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,920
out to be activists.

170
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,200
And this, of course, blossomed heavily during the new left rise in the late 60s and early

171
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,960
1970s.

172
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:15,200
And there you start getting those deeper currents of, you know, philosophy and history.

173
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,160
The new left mostly was philosophically informed by the Frankfurt School, which is in a sense

174
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,880
a it's a critical theory think tank that, you know, neo-Marxism is actually what it's

175
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,760
called or sometimes cultural Marxism is what their project was called.

176
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,960
And it tried to move the views of Marx out of the ideas of economics and into the ideas

177
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,200
of culture.

178
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,180
And so there, you know, there are these deep currents, but these feminist departments started

179
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:46,880
to manufacture very agendas literature and a blind eye was turned to them for a very

180
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,920
long time.

181
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,160
Nobody wanted to criticize them.

182
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,400
Nobody knew what was going on.

183
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,560
Nobody wanted to get called a sexist for going after it.

184
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,120
And they just kind of let them do what they want to do.

185
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,440
And this corpus of literature started to build and build and build on itself.

186
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,600
And it started to take on various other elements of critical theories.

187
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:10,520
It took on postmodern theory in the 1980s or a garbled version thereof or something

188
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,520
like that.

189
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:18,440
And then it's just continued to grow where it's had the policy of saying that any criticism

190
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:24,040
of it is illegitimate because it must be attacking the people, the women or the minorities

191
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,060
rather than the scholarship itself.

192
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:36,360
And it's been very, very effective at manipulating scholars in particular into not properly criticizing

193
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,620
it because it'll call them sexist or racist or accuse them of complicity in some system

194
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,620
of power.

195
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:48,920
And so theory built upon theory, built upon theory, built upon theory for a number of

196
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:55,240
decades, actually, to the point where finally, and I do say finally in a sense of, you know,

197
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,200
there being a real turning point.

198
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,440
This started, like I said, in the 1960s.

199
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:06,760
It wasn't really until 2010 that this got a proper grip around the throat of society

200
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,320
and stopped being some weird little academic subculture.

201
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,560
But the short answer to your question is academic feminism is how it happened.

202
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,520
And I guess just to make one real quick point about that, one of the most interesting weird

203
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:25,880
things they did being literature professors is they took up the tools of literary criticism,

204
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:32,760
which in particular for activists like feminist literary critics, it's a tool called close

205
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,480
reading or discourse, also discourse analysis are two different tools.

206
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,480
And close reading is, you know, you might read a text, its theme doesn't matter.

207
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,560
You're only looking for the places where it supports, you know, maybe patriarchal ideas

208
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,760
or thought or narratives or something like that.

209
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:55,760
And then the whole text can be impugned based upon finding those things often which are

210
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,500
not there, but are read into the text by the feminist at hand.

211
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:09,920
And so because they took up this habit of studying women's issues in culture via tools

212
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,600
like literary criticism uses, like they're reading it like society, they started to read

213
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,000
literally like a book and to look for all of its little problematic features, which

214
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,780
it assumed must be baked in because the power systems are there and so on.

215
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:28,200
And so because they had this really bizarre approach, they also were able to insulate

216
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:33,760
themselves from criticism because sociologists, for example, if they wanted to challenge this

217
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,960
stuff wouldn't be able to because it's using techniques of literary criticism, which they

218
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:42,320
have no expertise in and have no idea about because why in the world would they?

219
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,240
It's not a sociological technique, it's literary criticism.

220
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,960
So you know, they could play these kinds of games with those like out of scope theory

221
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:54,040
building and they've built an entire alternate universe in the process.

222
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,160
I don't want to let sociology totally off the hook either.

223
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:05,640
Sociology mostly, it technically began with people like Emil Durkheim, but it was taken

224
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,680
up very heavily by the critical theorists very intentionally.

225
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:15,760
Most of early sociology developed under the auspices of entities, think tank type entities

226
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:24,240
like the critical theorist Frankfurt School and like the socialist think tank Fabian Society,

227
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,040
which went on to spawn the London School of Economics, for example, in the UK.

228
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,480
So I mean, a lot of sociology was always done in a very agendas way.

229
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,600
So it also has some issues there.

230
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,760
And you can talk about it in other fields as well.

231
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,720
Cultural anthropology had problems from very early on and so on.

232
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,760
It just sounds like a very systematic and well thought of kind of a process that, as

233
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,040
you said, it took a couple of decades.

234
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:58,820
But the turning point that you mentioned 2010 is very aligned and completely makes sense

235
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:03,480
with the growth of social media and alternative media basically.

236
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,280
The kind of alliances that have been created between the neo-Marxist and this new left,

237
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,680
far left, whatever you want to call them, with big tech and mainstream media, was that

238
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,560
a turning point for that alliance as well and was that the reason that they basically

239
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:23,040
became such a real threat, I would say, to whoever who disagree with them?

240
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,800
So I think the other two things actually happening and they are related to one another here or

241
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,800
maybe three things.

242
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,800
We'll see how they pan out.

243
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:37,720
Certainly the new media environment, which doesn't just and everybody thinks, oh, it's

244
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:43,440
the Internet, it actually extends backwards to when even mass broadcasting became more

245
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,840
democratized.

246
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,720
When it used to be the case that there was like a really strong media monopoly held by

247
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:55,920
CBS, NBC, a very small number of companies or if you were outside of the United States

248
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,680
possibly state run operations.

249
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:05,220
So there's kind of a media monopoly going on there and then that started to break as

250
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,240
technology allowed more people to start doing talk radio.

251
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,400
This has been in the 1980s and then eventually cable television and a proliferation of cable

252
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,480
television stations.

253
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,560
So now you weren't locked into just a few channels.

254
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:21,080
Now you had, I mean, I remember the old Bruce Springsteen song, 57 channels and nothing's

255
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,080
on.

256
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,640
It was 57 at the time and it was 400.

257
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,560
Now there's like literally thousands of them, I think.

258
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:31,920
And then the Internet came along and just exploded this to the next level and then handheld

259
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,320
devices came along and it's with you everywhere and exploded it to another level.

260
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:43,000
And so these features, blogs in particular, were very influential early on at being able

261
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:52,200
to connect people who had similar ideas and they sort of enable this whole appeal to these

262
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:58,640
grievances or victimhood or trauma or harm and whip up a mob of people who are going

263
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,560
to agitate in support of that.

264
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:06,960
So it very much does require this kind of new media environment for it to exist.

265
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,520
And I think that genie's out of the bottle.

266
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:14,000
I don't think we're going back and I don't think we would want to go back to gated media

267
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,720
communities, but definitely it was in that situation that this was possible.

268
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:27,640
So one feature of that in terms of activism were, like I said, blogs, famously Tumblr,

269
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,200
if you want to talk about where most of queer and gender theory exploded in the past 20

270
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,480
years, 15 years I guess, would have been through the platform Tumblr, which considers itself

271
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,680
a social media blogging platform.

272
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,680
But other blogs were happening and people were writing and developing these theories

273
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:51,120
in a way that was never possible before because it had to happen through academic publishing

274
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,440
or even regular publishing, which requires a lot of infrastructure.

275
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,440
It's slow.

276
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,440
It's heavy.

277
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,960
To get something published in academia takes months and months and months and months, but

278
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,560
a blog publishes as fast as you push click on the mouse.

279
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,480
You submit or update or whatever it happens to be, post whatever the label is on the button,

280
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,120
and then it's everywhere.

281
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,280
It's literally got a global distribution audience if people know about your blog.

282
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,160
So that was a massive change that caused a lot of this.

283
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:24,960
Meanwhile, in the academy itself, while these developments were happening in technology,

284
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:32,320
the academy was building up on layer upon layer upon layer of generations of theory.

285
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:38,880
So when these first feminists were writing this stuff, was it the Feminine Mystique?

286
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,880
Was that right?

287
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,880
No.

288
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,880
The second sex.

289
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,120
Simone de Beauvoir's second sex was in 1949.

290
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:54,680
So starting then and kind of moving forward, it was very avant-garde and it was while the

291
00:20:54,680 --> 00:21:00,720
theorist says this and according to this theory, that, and according to that theory, and the

292
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,520
lens of theory was made very clear.

293
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:09,360
And then by 2010, it just started to be accepted that this is just, we know this stuff now.

294
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,960
We know about these systems of power.

295
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,080
These are realities of the world and people started talking that way.

296
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,040
The phrase is known, knowns.

297
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,980
It's actually hard to say that verbally and have people hear it.

298
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,140
It's easy to write.

299
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,240
So it's things that people just know are known.

300
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,720
And so within the academy, there was this academic literature, there's this big shift

301
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:37,680
in the late 2000 aughts into the early 2010s in which they're no longer appealing to the

302
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,900
theoretical construct.

303
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,000
They're just stating it like fact.

304
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,480
And there's no longer this reliance on this really deep complicated jargon for the most

305
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,480
part.

306
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,480
They start stating it in very simple terms.

307
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,320
In fact, a lot of their literature in the last 10 years reads like they're talking down

308
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,600
to a 10 year old and a 10 year old could probably read a lot of it.

309
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:03,240
So there's been this massive change in the academy because in their view, their theory

310
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,960
has matured to the point where it's just true.

311
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,360
And so that changed their perspective rather considerably.

312
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,840
So those kinds of things, the technological advances made it possible for it to take root

313
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,280
in the world.

314
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:26,120
And then I hate to call it the maturity of theory because it's a very immature theory

315
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:31,200
in another sense, but the fact that their theory has had many decades of building on

316
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,760
itself just made it able to just be taken as in a sense, gospel.

317
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,280
How can a theory become mature when it's contained by morality though?

318
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,280
That's the thing.

319
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,560
I keep bringing up what AOC said that it's more important to be moral than being factual

320
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,960
or morally right than factually correct.

321
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,560
It says everything that people need to know about this whole thing, that morality that

322
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,040
comes from lack of factuality.

323
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,720
Right.

324
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,200
That's why I hesitate around the word mature.

325
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,040
It matured in the sense of its own kind of ecosystem.

326
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,640
It is not a mature theory of the world.

327
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,080
It does not have a good understanding of things.

328
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:14,840
It is in a sense, so in 2014, I believe, the astrophysicist Sean Carroll, who incidentally

329
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:20,280
is very taken in by this social theory, which is kind of funny, had a debate with the famous

330
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:27,840
evangelical Christian apologist, William Lane Craig, and he did that in Louisiana, I think

331
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,200
in New Orleans in February, I think, of 2014.

332
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,680
And it was a stunning spectacle to watch.

333
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:41,460
I think it was actually a turning point in a sense for designing arguments about kind

334
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,200
of moral ideologies.

335
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,360
And what Sean Carroll did was stood up there and, you know, if you know about William Lane

336
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,160
Craig, he's a very detailed debater.

337
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,480
He's a very educated man.

338
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,760
He's a very intelligent man.

339
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,660
He's a very sharp debater, and he does do his homework.

340
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,360
So he knows the other side fairly well.

341
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,800
He knows where the holes are to pick at, and he can do it really, really well.

342
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:08,240
And normally, he goes in these debates and he convinces a lot of people, and it's kind

343
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,160
of back and forth about the details and everything gets all murky.

344
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,760
And Sean Carroll didn't take that approach.

345
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:17,120
Sean Carroll stood up there and said, yeah, you're putting forth, you know, you're talking

346
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,400
about this model, and then there's this other model in cosmology, and this other model.

347
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,760
There's lots of models.

348
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:27,460
There are a lot of models, and this thing you're doing with theology is another model.

349
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,800
But we actually have ways to tell how mature a model is, how good of a model of the world

350
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,800
it is.

351
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,800
It has to meet certain criteria.

352
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,560
And he starts listing the criteria for a model to be grown up.

353
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,400
And it's, you know, it can do this, it can do that, it has these properties.

354
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,860
And he starts laying them out, and he's like, I don't know which theory of cosmology is

355
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,720
correct and neither do you.

356
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,000
But these that we're talking about that fall within cosmology are mature models because

357
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,880
they meet all of these criteria, whereas the theology model doesn't meet any of the criteria

358
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,700
except maybe the first one or something like that.

359
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,560
And so this is the same thing that's happening here.

360
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,360
When you see somebody like AOC saying it's more important to be morally correct than

361
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,160
factually correct or morally right than factually correct or however the exact phrasing goes,

362
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,240
it's actually the same thing.

363
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:16,120
It's appealing back to these immature models that suit our intuitions, our moral feelings

364
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:21,120
about things, rather than trying to actually understand the world.

365
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:27,160
And that is actually a catastrophe when you live in an advanced democracy and an advanced

366
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,640
world.

367
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,560
When you live in a world that has the kind of technological power that we have in the

368
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:39,280
kind of complex systems, even for like food distribution, you cannot go away from factually

369
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:45,480
correct and expect that things to go okay.

370
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,480
It is actually catastrophic.

371
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,680
So it is very alarming.

372
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,680
And so when I say it matured, I mean, it's like, I don't know a good, there are no good

373
00:25:54,680 --> 00:26:01,400
metaphors to use for it, but it's like it doesn't have the, it's not a mature model,

374
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:06,840
but within its own ecosystem, it is now seen as a mature model is maybe the best way to

375
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,840
put it.

376
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,480
It's seen as something that's got a long academic pedigree.

377
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,200
And then people outside of the model, say like Sean Carroll in this case, look upon

378
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
this, and they're like, oh, well, they've been doing whatever they're doing.

379
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,960
I don't know the details, but they've been doing it for, it's important for at least

380
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,960
50 years.

381
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,360
So, you know, it's pretty well established at this point.

382
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,480
And then they have that sense of pretty well established, even though what's inside is

383
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,880
utter crap.

384
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:37,560
It's a moral agenda that's rooted in a very particular political view rather than anything

385
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:44,960
like truth or knowledge or accuracy or civility or any of the norms of liberal society, for

386
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,960
example.

387
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,760
And what's interesting to me is that based on what you said, it became what it became

388
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,960
because of democratization of information that has worked like a double-edged sword.

389
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,080
That now they want to contain it in favor of themselves, you know, pushing YouTube,

390
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:03,120
for example, removing channels that are talking against what they believe or Twitter, the

391
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,120
same thing.

392
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:10,560
Which begs the question, is democracy itself a platform that allow these people to take

393
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:16,160
over based on because one vote is equal to another vote and, you know, a far left vote

394
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,880
can neutralize a vote of irrational thinker?

395
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,760
Have we reached the limits of representative democracy because people who believe in whatever

396
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,840
they want to believe in and there's nothing we can't do about it because they believe

397
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,840
in it?

398
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,200
See, that's an interesting question because, I mean, even the ancient Greeks knew that

399
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:41,400
democracy had its limits and they were very afraid of democracy.

400
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:49,800
And so when the enlightenment liberalism phase in the mostly 18th century arose and we started

401
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:55,920
establishing these things, we didn't establish democracies, we established Republican democracies.

402
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,800
So the idea was actually there was supposed to be a layer of experts between legislation

403
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:05,760
and the people because the people directly will never protect the minority interests.

404
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,800
There are all kinds of problems with either mob ruler, majority ruler, so on and so forth.

405
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:17,680
And so the idea was that you would have a competent professional class who the public

406
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:22,680
then decide upon and then the competent professional class are going to be the ones who actually

407
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,160
do the legislating and the governance.

408
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,000
And of course, it's never worked out perfectly because people are people.

409
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,920
And there have been lots of problems with it.

410
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:37,360
In this, there have been a few things that have been going on over the past centuries

411
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:43,600
or century in particular, which has been this great push for more and more and more and

412
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:50,120
more democracy, like democracy is this unfettered good without a balancing more and more and

413
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:56,680
more republicanism, which means that there is not necessarily a technocratic expert class

414
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:02,800
in between, but that there is a professional class of people who actually when put up as

415
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,400
representatives know what they're doing.

416
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:09,760
So now it's like, because again, probably the way that things have changed, it's very

417
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,780
easy to just become famous and then get elected based on your fame.

418
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:19,060
We now have a problem and there's this big bias toward, oh, we've got to get these professionals

419
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,060
out of here.

420
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:24,280
We've got to get these citizens in Congress and it's actually, we probably don't, not

421
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,840
very often anyway.

422
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:33,920
And so now there's this odd problem where we still have a republican representative

423
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,640
democracy, but we're electing morons.

424
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,600
We're electing agenda driven fools.

425
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:43,060
Luckily, there's still enough of a balance of power to keep that from doing anything.

426
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:47,020
But the answer that it's arrived us at is utter stalemate.

427
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:51,480
And since there's utter political stalemate, the result is that everything switches down

428
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,120
to the next level, which is to start trying to enforce power through culture.

429
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,480
Now as for them trying to take away the keys to free speech, which is a separate issue,

430
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,360
it's really interesting because you can think of, this actually reveals that these people

431
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,080
are tin pot dictators.

432
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:12,060
Because what's happening is the dictator's dilemma as it sometimes gets called.

433
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,600
The dictator's dilemma is an information rule.

434
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:21,120
So with the dictator's dilemma, if you're a dictator, you have to figure out how to

435
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,520
handle information flow.

436
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,960
You know that your regime is doing things you don't want the public to find out about

437
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,240
because then they'll depose you.

438
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:35,880
So you've got this problem and you have to decide, well, do I allow information to flow

439
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,480
or do I shut it off?

440
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:42,440
And the dictator is in a dilemma once you get to a sufficient amount of information

441
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:48,640
flow, not just a couple of state channels like you say have in North Korea because once

442
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:54,480
there's information flow, if they allow it, it will be their undoing because their corruption

443
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,640
and so on and brutality will be unmasked.

444
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:02,400
That's what you saw happen with the Arab Spring, for example, arising was the brutality, like

445
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:11,520
the Mubarak, what was it, yeah, Hasni Mubarak in Egypt, the brutality of that regime was

446
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,600
exposed and all of a sudden everything erupted in Cairo in 2011.

447
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:22,280
And so the other side of the coin is they can repress information, but then people know

448
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,960
that the information is being repressed.

449
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:29,240
So you out yourself as a dictator and people don't much like feeling like they're being

450
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,140
lied to and having information restricted from them.

451
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:37,240
And so when you see this as a social justice crowd now with these kind of big tech companies,

452
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,840
you're having the same thing play out actually, the exact same dynamic is playing out.

453
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:47,900
It's very clearly the same thing because you have this group of people all over social

454
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,900
media.

455
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,640
I don't want to say it's a hard group, but you have a lot of people acting on social

456
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:58,320
media who are very aware that there are YouTube sensors, that there are Twitter sensors, that

457
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,040
there are Facebook sensors and that these people are enacting their social vision on

458
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,040
the public.

459
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:11,480
So they're picking the repressed side of the dictator's dilemma, but once you choose either

460
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,080
course of that, you then reveal yourself to be a dictator.

461
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,960
So these people trying to know that they have hegemonic control over a lot of culture are

462
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,840
trying to enact a dictatorial program.

463
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,000
And the reasons are obvious besides the fact that they're explicitly anti-liberal and have

464
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:33,600
blamed liberal society for every problem in the world going back to the 1920s.

465
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,600
If you didn't know that, they do.

466
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,320
One of the core pillars of what's called critical race theory is anti-liberalism.

467
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,640
It's like the third pillar when they list them in order.

468
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,720
It's sort of important to be anti-liberal.

469
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:51,640
What are the first two?

470
00:32:51,640 --> 00:33:01,240
The first one is that racism is ordinary in American society and the second one is interest

471
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:06,120
convergence, which is that members of, since it's race, we'll say it was just white people,

472
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:13,160
but it's generally dominant groups, don't give opportunities to minority groups or oppressed

473
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,080
groups unless it's also in their interest to do so.

474
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:24,000
So there's always a selfish motive if things get better for any minority group.

475
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Those are the first two.

476
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And the third one is anti-liberalism.

477
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,080
Do you think someone like Joe Biden is kind of helping these people or hurting them by

478
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:36,280
saying stuff like, if you don't vote for me, you ain't black?

479
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,720
What does that say?

480
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,720
He's hurting.

481
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,680
It's such a complicated way to start helping and hurting because it's like who?

482
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,240
He's not helping his cause to get elected.

483
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:54,520
That's for certain, but he is signaling to the in-crowd for the most part that he's kind

484
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:59,320
of hip to the social justice jive, if you will.

485
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:05,400
But even within the, like that one fell, the bad part is that Biden was probably just making

486
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:09,360
a joke that landed really badly, whereas other people really do make that argument.

487
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,680
I mean, it's not only Biden.

488
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:17,920
The guy in Virginia wore blackface or KKK hood and like, whatever, Trudeau in Canada,

489
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:22,800
he says clearly, I don't even remember how many times I wore blackface.

490
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:28,520
He groped a 18 year old reporter in Montreal and like, I didn't do it.

491
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,040
But you know, just imagine if Trump would be doing any of that.

492
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,960
So this hypocrisy, I'm just wondering until what point the mainstream would be like, you

493
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,880
know, there is no way that we can cover for these people.

494
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:45,460
So I mean, the far left will cover for these people literally forever because your politics

495
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,080
are your person.

496
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,520
And so literally forever.

497
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,000
So you're just going to have to deal with that.

498
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,840
But the deal is what you just pointed out, the hypocrisy is obvious and everybody else

499
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,840
hates it.

500
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,840
I don't know why human beings are as sensitive to hypocrisy as we are.

501
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,520
I know why we're sensitive to it.

502
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,800
I mean, the reasons are easy to work out why we would be sensitive to hypocrisy.

503
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,480
But because you got people who would be, you know, double dealing and telling people what

504
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,760
to do and working their own advantage.

505
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,640
So it makes sense why we're sensitive to it, but we are like psychologically hyper sensitive

506
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:24,500
to the level where I'm almost convinced that we would gladly watch the world be destroyed

507
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:29,280
around us as long as and do nothing, as long as we could call everybody out as hypocrites

508
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,280
who's being a hypocrite.

509
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,600
It's like it blinds us to every other concern.

510
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:39,920
So like when this happens with Biden or when Ta-Nehisi Coates says that Kanye West is no

511
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,080
longer black because he wore a MAGA hat and you know, these different examples that you've

512
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:50,320
brought up with more stuff with Biden stuff around Trudeau, I mean, it's really everywhere.

513
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:56,800
The Virginia guy, when you bring these things up, everybody else is like, ah, screw these

514
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,800
people.

515
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,800
They're hypocrites, right?

516
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,000
What they're detecting is in the literature called parochial altruism, they're showing

517
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,240
that, you know, these people are just playing for their team.

518
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,060
They're not honest brokers.

519
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,940
And then that turns people away from them.

520
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:17,600
So I mean, Biden hurt his electoral chances, which hurts the progressive agenda rather

521
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:23,960
a lot when he said that, but as it works out, depending on who you're asking, some of them

522
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:28,360
very much were glad he said it and defended it and all of these things because it signals

523
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,520
the right kind of politics.

524
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,960
So it's like, I don't know, back, I'm old enough to remember and it's happening now

525
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,400
on the left, but it was definitely more happening on the right 10, 15 years ago.

526
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:48,300
What the saying was that conservatism doesn't fail, people fail conservatism.

527
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,360
And it's like the same thing's happening on the left now.

528
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,680
It's like social justice can't fail.

529
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,440
People fail social justice.

530
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,440
And when you have that, you have this situation where literally you're doing something that

531
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:04,320
hurts your own interests, driving your movement more into the crazy.

532
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:10,200
And nevertheless, people within it think it's the right thing to have done and believe that

533
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,440
it helps their interests because they're more concerned about the depth of moral purity

534
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:20,540
in their fundamentally religious at that point movement than they are about actually succeeding

535
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,540
at anything.

536
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:26,560
And this is, I mean, it's got to be said at some point very clearly, progressive social

537
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:32,000
justice stuff isn't actually progressive at all.

538
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,320
People call it the regressive left for a reason.

539
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,700
There's no real interest in progress.

540
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,000
It's not about progress.

541
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,400
It's about empowering the people that have the ability to push this stuff.

542
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,820
It's not about progress in any respect whatsoever.

543
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:54,980
You mentioned the new atheist movement was also hijacked by the social justice and feminism.

544
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,060
Would you expand on that?

545
00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:01,160
Because I also asked this question from Peter Boghossian that he was also very instrumental,

546
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,760
obviously, in the new atheist movement that one of the argument is that the reason that

547
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:10,040
we are here was because we have moved away from the values that have been created in

548
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:15,400
the West and especially the United States because of Judeo-Christian approach and ethics

549
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,560
and morality that had allowed liberalism, classic liberalism to grow to where it was.

550
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,920
But new atheism basically came and said, none of that matters, but it created its own tribe

551
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,040
and tribal attitude and approach of itself.

552
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:38,120
I think that is in very, very impressionistic pictures, kind of accurate, but it gives the

553
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,520
new atheist movement more credit than it deserves.

554
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:48,840
I think it is generally right that the decline of what you might call traditional Judeo-Christian

555
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:54,440
values, I kind of recoil at that term, but we'll go with it, did create and make the

556
00:38:54,440 --> 00:39:01,460
space for this, but again, the new atheist thing started in 2004.

557
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:04,720
You can date it to the publication of The End of Faith by Sam Harris.

558
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,240
It's widely agreed to be the beginning of the so-called new atheist movement.

559
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:18,440
The deep criticism of liberalism and of religion and its role in maintaining inequalities in

560
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:25,240
society dates back to the 1920s with the Frankfurt School for certain among other kind of parallel

561
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,240
movements.

562
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,880
Certainly, Marxism had these kinds of things and Nietzsche talked about these kinds of

563
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,880
things.

564
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,080
I think once Darwin wrote down the theory of evolution and even in some sense when once

565
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:43,880
Newton wrote down the laws of motion, the ability to believe in a properly pre-modern

566
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:50,880
world that's guided by the hand of deities was going to just start dissolving.

567
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,120
We've had a slow dissolution.

568
00:39:53,120 --> 00:40:00,920
Now the atheist movement itself, the new atheist movement in 2004, I think it died out by 2015.

569
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:05,960
It believes it's still in existence, but I think it was dead by 2015, so we'll give

570
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,200
it that 11-year run.

571
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:14,400
That came along and was very much so a blend of a kind of enlightenment rationalist thing

572
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,760
and a very much social justice pissed off at religion for the way that it has treated

573
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,000
women and gay people in particular.

574
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,320
You had this very strong kind of gender and feminism driven social justice movement that

575
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,760
was in it.

576
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:37,360
It really did allow the, it did help, I should say, the incubation of that movement in American

577
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:43,400
society and other English speaking societies in the world because it gave it a home and

578
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,040
it gave it a lot of ability and it started to further crack those structures that were

579
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,360
keeping it at bay.

580
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:53,080
But I don't think, I think we would still be pretty close, if the new atheism had never

581
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:57,280
happened, I think we'd still be pretty close to where we are now just because of the internet.

582
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,440
Feminism was still happening.

583
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,400
It just would have caught on somewhere else.

584
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:06,840
It caught on in atheism first really in a very significant way for I think very significant

585
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:11,640
reasons, which I said most of them were, many of the people involved in the new atheist

586
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:16,600
movement were there because they were pissed off about the way that Christianity in the

587
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:21,400
United States in particular was treating women and homosexuals.

588
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:26,360
And so it was a social justice rooted movement that took up a lot of these critical theories

589
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,480
off of all the blogs they were reading and sharing at the time.

590
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,680
And so by 2008, 2009, it had got really hot.

591
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:39,920
By 2011, there was a incident that became kind of the triggering incident where the

592
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,440
community split around it and it was a death spiral from there.

593
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:49,280
That was the so-called elevator gate incident, which I don't know if you are familiar with

594
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,280
what happened.

595
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,160
Peter probably described it, but maybe not.

596
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,880
Please expand on that, I don't think I know about that.

597
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:01,520
Okay, so what was going on up to that point was this is what happens in general.

598
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,520
So it's worth paying attention if you have an organization and it's tipping like, oh,

599
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,360
let's do some diversity stuff.

600
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,360
Let's let that in.

601
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:14,440
This is what happens in general and the atheist movement went through this in, like I said,

602
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:19,440
the lead up would have been 2007, 8, 9, 10.

603
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:25,900
And what happens is people increasingly start pushing for the activist agenda, the social

604
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,900
justice agenda.

605
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,200
In this case, like I said, it was mostly feminism.

606
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,680
They were very concerned about sexism in the atheist movement.

607
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,400
They started saying that the atheist movement itself was systemically sexist.

608
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,000
There's an old boys club, blah, blah, blah.

609
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,720
It tried to keep women down.

610
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:47,000
A lot of these people were people who were very just motivated by the activism.

611
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,920
Other ones were very clearly careerist because they were trying to leverage that to get speaking

612
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,800
arrangements and conferences and book deals and things like that.

613
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,100
And many of them succeeded in doing so.

614
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:05,960
So that by 2011, your typical atheist conference would have lots of panels by kind of these

615
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,520
little activists who mostly their only claim to fame was having a blog.

616
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:16,240
When I got involved in the atheism movement, my whole first thing was having a blog because

617
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,680
it was all bloggers.

618
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:23,040
And so you could actually become somebody with a salary, of a sense, in the movement

619
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,200
by having an influential enough blog.

620
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,760
And this kind of social complaining can give you a lot of influence.

621
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,160
So as it pans out, there's this big conference that happens in 2011.

622
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:40,960
And one of these activists has her panel that she's on and she delivers her talk in her

623
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:41,960
panel.

624
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,200
Her name's Rebecca Watson.

625
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,240
She goes after the panel later in the day.

626
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,280
She gets in the elevator to go up in the hotel to her room.

627
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:55,120
Some man gets, I don't know, I think young, but I don't know for sure the details of the

628
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:59,640
man gets in the elevator at the same time, just by coincidence.

629
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:04,920
As the elevator's going up, he plucks up the courage, asks her out to coffee, says, I really

630
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:10,060
liked your panel, would like to know if I could take you to coffee sometime or something

631
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,320
like this.

632
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,120
And the elevator stops at her floor.

633
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,600
She says no, everything, that's it, the end.

634
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,600
He doesn't chase her.

635
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,080
He doesn't come into her room.

636
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,600
He doesn't keep the elevator closed and try to kiss her or something crazy.

637
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,600
Nothing happens.

638
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,600
She said no.

639
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,600
He gets shut down.

640
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,600
He's like, okay.

641
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,760
She gets off the elevator at her floor, goes to her room, immediately turns on her computer,

642
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:39,560
flips on her video, her webcam and does a video blog about how this is completely inappropriate.

643
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,120
This is sexism in the atheist movement.

644
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,760
This is why the whole thing's sexist.

645
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,240
It makes women like her very uncomfortable.

646
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,360
She's a speaker and then some guy is just going to talk to her in the elevator.

647
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,280
She doesn't know if he's going to rape her.

648
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,560
She's terrified, blah, blah, blah.

649
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:58,000
The whole kind of overblown, you know, typical reaction that we're all familiar with with

650
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,840
this kind of shit now.

651
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:08,920
And so this goes kind of viral in the atheist community and maybe it would have died a moderately

652
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:14,480
quiet death and the big death knell incident would have waited till later.

653
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:21,760
But then one Richard Dawkins decided to make fun of it publicly and I understand why.

654
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,040
And so he writes this letter called the Dear Muslima Letter talking about how women are

655
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:31,440
treated under the more brutal interpretations of Islam.

656
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,040
And he's like, but don't worry, you know, Rebecca Watson got asked out in an elevator

657
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:41,920
or something like, you know, some just perspective blasting snarky thing.

658
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:47,440
And so this, of course, went absolutely viral because Richard Dawkins wrote it and it was

659
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,140
this huge deal around that.

660
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:54,480
And so what happens is generally to kind of like take one step back real quick, you're

661
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,640
going to let some diversity in.

662
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,000
That's a good idea.

663
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,200
You start building up the pattern as you start building up a set of sympathies to that worldview

664
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,200
and you start to build up a set of people.

665
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,640
Once it hits 15 to 20 percent of your community, probably even 7 to 8 percent, you're in a

666
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,440
lot of trouble.

667
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,960
And then a precipitating event, in this case, it was Richard Dawkins responding to that

668
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:24,440
video comes along and it forces now everybody to start taking sides.

669
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:30,600
And so in a sense in 2011, starting with what was now called Elevator Gate, the Me Too movement

670
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:35,920
actually started in the atheist movement, but nowhere else.

671
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,720
And it went wildfire.

672
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:41,520
It was to the point where people were scared to go to atheist conferences at all, lest

673
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,360
they get accused of like hooking up with somebody, even if they didn't do it, maybe they're just

674
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,720
going to get accused.

675
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,280
But men were afraid to go to conferences.

676
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,880
They started leveraging this to get Richard Dawkins isn't allowed to speak at conferences

677
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,880
anymore.

678
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,880
Well, guess what?

679
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,040
People go to conferences to see headliners.

680
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:02,500
They don't go to see some dork with a blog who's bitching about feminism.

681
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:09,320
And so the whole architecture of conferences and book deals and all of these things started

682
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:13,560
to change really rapidly and the whole community polarized around it.

683
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:18,160
So you had to pick a side and your side was either going to be that you were going to

684
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:25,600
be a feminist or you were going to be on the side of this patriarchal sexism that characterizes

685
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,760
the true nature of the atheist movement, which has now been revealed because its biggest

686
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,400
leaders have said things like what Richard Dawkins did or Sam Harris got caught out and

687
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,400
so he didn't get caught out.

688
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:42,400
He had asked some question in a gotcha style, answered with an odd joke that was probably

689
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,040
ill-advised and somehow magically proved his sexism.

690
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:50,280
So now all the great architects, I mean, Christopher Hitchens had famously written a piece called

691
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:57,160
Women Aren't Funny and so all of them basically got nuked for being sexist.

692
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,560
The whole program is sexist.

693
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,600
So now we've got to undo systemic sexism.

694
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,920
And then there's this rape culture throughout because some guy asked a woman out in an elevator.

695
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,680
So now there's obviously rape culture and all these guys will hook up and there were

696
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:16,640
all these powerful, I mean, this is what famous people tend to do is that famous men tend

697
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,180
to have women become very interested in them.

698
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:23,480
Some of them just want to have sex with the person because they're famous or maybe because

699
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,480
they like them or they're interested or whatever the reasons are.

700
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,580
But some of them see, man, maybe if so and so has sex with me, then he's going to help

701
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:31,580
my career.

702
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:35,360
And then a lot of times the man doesn't see it that way, doesn't help her career and all

703
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:38,840
of a sudden she changed her mind and she was raped or sexually assaulted.

704
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:44,200
And his power in the, which she was the only one paying attention to it, his power is the

705
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:48,280
reason that he was able to coerce her into having sex, even though maybe it was her idea

706
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,480
in the first place.

707
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,960
And this actually, this stuff happens all the time.

708
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:57,800
And so now it became like you couldn't go to conferences, they weren't fun, nothing

709
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,480
interesting was going on.

710
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:04,080
There were constant squabbles, people getting thrown out, deplatformed, canceled and so

711
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,080
on.

712
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,160
And everybody's afraid they're going to get accused.

713
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:12,760
So the whole thing melted down and fell apart from within over this by, like I said, four

714
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:18,320
years later, the thing was a burned out husk of what it used to be.

715
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:22,900
And so again, I think it gives too much credit to say that the New Atheism Movement came

716
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,000
in and made this happen.

717
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,720
I think that that tracks back a lot longer.

718
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:34,440
The Enlightenment, this is the consequence of the Enlightenment in some respect.

719
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:40,040
But the New Atheist Movement, I mean, the decline of religion and thus open space for

720
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:43,640
things like this is the consequence of the Enlightenment, not this specific thing, because

721
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,480
this is definitely anti-Enlightenment.

722
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:54,120
But then the New Atheist Movement itself provided a very nurturing spot to incubate one corner

723
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:59,000
of that movement that then those people no longer having a movement, but having lots

724
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,480
of activity left in them, lots of activism left in them, had to go out and start colonizing

725
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:07,760
other places and ruining those places too.

726
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:13,120
And that's, I think, kind of a more comprehensive picture of how that went down.

727
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,120
But it's a model.

728
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:21,520
It's a model for how this will play out in everything that takes this stuff on.

729
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:27,000
And first of all, it's fascinating to me that the entire New Atheist Movement was derailed

730
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,400
because of an elevator and a feminist and the whole microcosm of what happened and how

731
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,640
much we can learn from it and people completely ignore what happened.

732
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,760
But the atheism, I didn't know it was called New Atheism back then.

733
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:44,080
When I came from Iran as a refugee to Canada, it was very attractive to me.

734
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,480
I would call myself a militant atheist.

735
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:54,120
I listened, you know, I got all of DVDs by the Four Horsemen, Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett,

736
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:57,700
Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens.

737
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:03,080
But I started criticizing political Islam because, you know, I'm an ex-Muslim.

738
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:09,340
I grew up in that country and I know the kind of damage that it causes, beginning with Muslims.

739
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:13,920
And I started getting attacked by people from that community, people who were atheists.

740
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,280
And I'm like, well, maybe you should also criticize Christianity as much as you're

741
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,880
criticizing Islam.

742
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,800
And then I started getting, you know, attacked more and more and more and more and I was

743
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:27,160
called a racist and a bigot and all of that.

744
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,600
Of course you were.

745
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,760
So that was happening too, but it wasn't as it wasn't.

746
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:37,760
It would have eventually, by the way, that would have eventually been a precipitating

747
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,800
event had it not been some feminist thing first or whatever.

748
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:47,360
And so that's the deal is like this stuff, it will always it's like it's so toxic and

749
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:51,240
it's so demanding that everybody take one side or the other.

750
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,720
You hear this in the literature all the time.

751
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,880
There's no such thing as a non-racist.

752
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,200
There are only racists and anti-racists.

753
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,560
So you have to pick a side.

754
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,720
Are you on the side of the anti-racist or are you going to be on the side of the racist?

755
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,140
And that's the game that they play.

756
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:05,560
They put people in these weird positions.

757
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:10,720
So you get you ended up in the racist position, which is kind of funny.

758
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:15,560
So you know, we had this guy come to a talk one time, not to divert my point or I'd probably

759
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:19,680
forget it, but I had this we had this talk in his intersectionality of religion.

760
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:26,120
And this guy from India was there and professor forgot something, something hard, something

761
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,120
very technical.

762
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,120
Right.

763
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,680
So this guy knows what he's talking about.

764
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,640
And he's coming in and he's he listens to our whole thing and he stands up.

765
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,720
He's like, I want to talk to you guys because I'm very excited and he always got the thickest

766
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:38,720
possible accent.

767
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,000
I mean, really dark skin, the whole thing.

768
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,840
And he's like, they're accusing me of being a white supremacist.

769
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:48,160
I don't know why they're accusing me of being a white supremacist.

770
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:52,520
And it's just like to hear it, you know, super thick accent and everything else is just like

771
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,120
almost hilarious that this is happening.

772
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:59,160
And it's and it's because, you know, he taught this thing or whatever that supposedly has

773
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,880
some possibly racist application.

774
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,840
But he's like, but it's standard theory.

775
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:03,840
I don't understand.

776
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,200
And now I'm a white supremacist and all these kids.

777
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:10,440
And he's like, I'm not even white, you know, and it's just like, OK, but they're the point

778
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:15,960
I was making is they're the thing is toxic and it forces you to make to take sides.

779
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:22,000
And there will always eventually be a precipitating event that once there's this in these things,

780
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,080
these tests for these things are happening constantly.

781
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:32,000
It's once you have a sufficiently large sympathetic community that thinks in these zero sum, like

782
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,960
very Manichaean terms, that's when that's going to happen.

783
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,800
And then sooner or later, an event will either be manufactured if you really want to be cynical

784
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:45,800
about it or will one will occur eventually anyway, like somebody will ask somebody out

785
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:50,440
in an elevator and then boom, you know, it's like you've got all this powder and somebody

786
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:55,960
just set a spark to it and the whole thing blows up and then things are going to always

787
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:56,960
fall apart.

788
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,000
So there will always be one.

789
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,600
So with the new atheist movement, seeing the way that ex-Muslims were getting treated in

790
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,720
the way that Sam Harris was getting caught, you know, it's gross, it's racist to the very

791
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:09,240
famous Ben Affleck incident on Bill Maher.

792
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:14,920
It was only a matter of time if feminism didn't blow it up that it being allegedly racist

793
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,560
to criticize Islam was going to be the thing.

794
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,600
That was the other hot button issue there.

795
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:23,120
It wasn't like, you know, the typical American black white racism thing.

796
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:29,440
It was definitely the white versus, or even not even white, but like American or Western

797
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:36,320
view versus, I should say, versus Islam, which that's covered under post-colonial theory

798
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:41,400
more than it is under the other ones, but utterly forbidden.

799
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:47,120
So that would have been, the same fate was happening sooner or later anyway, and that

800
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:51,360
would have been the thing if it wasn't feminism or if it wasn't something else first.

801
00:54:51,360 --> 00:55:00,280
It just so happened that it was this idiotic feminist thing that just because somebody

802
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:04,920
gave it the attention it needed to become a wildfire, it became a wildfire.

803
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:10,600
But you can't ignore it either because if you ignore it, that's how it's growing sympathies.

804
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:16,280
Maybe the silver lining is that because how awful this tribe of irrational fundamentalists

805
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,360
are bringing everybody else together against them.

806
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,480
Can that be considered as a silver lining or there is no silver lining?

807
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,840
I don't know if there's a silver lining.

808
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:34,200
I mean, it does help actually for people to see that this really is a fundamentalist religious

809
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,200
type thing.

810
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:40,560
I had actually somebody send me a direct message on Twitter earlier, who's also from Iran.

811
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:45,600
And he was talking, he's like, it's killing me to watch, he was talking about something

812
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:53,960
in medicine, to watch exactly the same kind of theocratic nonsense, brainwashing taking

813
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:59,640
place even not just in the West, but in sciences like medicine and to watch people do the same

814
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,680
kinds of contortions that they did to defend religion.

815
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:06,400
He's like, I left Iran because I wanted to get away from this.

816
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:11,200
And now he's like, I never in my life thought that not only would I see it in the West,

817
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,280
but that I see it in medicine, in a science.

818
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:21,160
And then at the same time, I get messages constantly from people who escaped some place,

819
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:26,960
whether it's they or their parents escaped China during Mao or whether it's somebody

820
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:33,000
whose family escaped Cuba, whether it's somebody who escaped Hungary or lived through Hungary.

821
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,360
And it was communists or people who were in the Soviet Union or who are in East Germany

822
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,400
or any of these kinds of stories.

823
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:43,080
I get stuff all the time from these people are like, what's happening?

824
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:49,080
We got out of, they say communism and communism is happening again.

825
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:54,440
And here where we came for safety, and it's just like really a shocking phenomenon to

826
00:56:54,440 --> 00:57:02,980
hear it so regularly compared to both communism and theocracy by people who lived in regime

827
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:03,980
regimes.

828
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:06,360
It's just a shocking thing.

829
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:12,920
And the fact that people seem just so asleep to the problem.

830
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,800
I don't mean that I hate that whole wake up thing.

831
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:16,800
Wake up sheeple.

832
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,800
I hate that.

833
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:18,800
Me too.

834
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:19,800
I don't even know what that means.

835
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:20,800
Wake up to what?

836
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:21,800
To do what?

837
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:22,800
Yeah.

838
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:28,320
It's become aware is what it really means and become an activist, of course.

839
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:32,600
So I don't want that to be the case, but it's like people really do have to understand

840
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:40,760
that this isn't this benign thing that's fighting for human rights or human betterment.

841
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,160
It's really something different.

842
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:49,080
And when the people who have escaped theocracies, repressive theocracies, and people who have

843
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:57,160
escaped literal communist regimes that were brutal and awful are saying, stop, stop, stop.

844
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,160
What are you doing?

845
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,160
You're making the same mistakes.

846
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:04,020
At some point, you've really got to open your eyes and think, wait a minute.

847
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:07,240
Maybe this isn't just some silly college kids yelling.

848
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,640
Maybe something really bad is happening.

849
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:14,560
Not to get too dramatic about it, but the Red Guard in China, which was one of the ways

850
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:23,600
that Mao seized most of his power in his second big bid was after the Great Leap Forward failed.

851
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:28,160
The Red Guard was a bunch of college kids yelling and whining.

852
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,320
That's what they were.

853
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:35,440
And so it's like, open your eyes, you know, this is actually serious.

854
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,080
This is threatening stuff.

855
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,080
Yeah.

856
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,480
I wish we had more time.

857
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:42,280
We could talk a little more about China, but I know your time is limited.

858
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,800
I want to talk about mathematics.

859
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,240
You have a PhD in mathematics.

860
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:49,520
Do you think mathematics was invented or discovered?

861
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:50,520
Both.

862
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:51,520
Both.

863
00:58:51,520 --> 00:59:03,560
I have a very not common view about the ontology of mathematics.

864
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:09,360
My philosophy of mathematics is I don't know if it's unique, but I've not read much of

865
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,360
it.

866
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:16,400
So I fundamentally think that mathematics is empirical.

867
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:22,120
It all starts with numbers and our numbers start by counting things and seeing what happens

868
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:24,040
when we count things.

869
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:33,160
So what we call a single unit, one, is definable once we define a unit of what.

870
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:39,680
And so we have this idea of one that is one of any particular unit that you might choose.

871
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:44,120
And then you can see what happens if you take one and then you take a second one and you

872
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,120
put them together.

873
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:49,440
In other words, you can add and you see that you end up with what we define to be two units

874
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,080
and then three units and so on.

875
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:55,640
And you could do experiments, although they would be very boring, about what happens if

876
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,640
you multiply.

877
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:01,880
So what happens if I take, say, five units of this and put it this way and six units

878
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,800
of that and put it that way and make a grid?

879
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:10,080
I'm always going to end up with 30 total units and some multiplication comes out.

880
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:15,440
So the very fundamentals of number theory are, in my opinion, likely to be empirical.

881
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,480
And then they were axiomatized, they became a logical system.

882
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:27,360
And then that logical system, because the axioms are so easily agreed upon when you're

883
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:36,120
talking about relatively simple ones, like there is a number zero or one, whichever one

884
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,120
you want.

885
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:41,520
And if you add one to it, there's this idea of a successor, then you can start to predict

886
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,400
what other axioms might be.

887
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,720
And that's where you can start getting into the really abstract stuff, like being able

888
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,040
to take one and add one again and add one again and add one again.

889
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:55,880
In principle, indefinitely gives you this idea of what the infinite might be.

890
01:00:55,880 --> 01:01:00,360
It turns out you can't get to the infinite within basic number theory axioms.

891
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:03,760
So you have to add a new axiom called the axiom of infinity, but you can decide what

892
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,100
that axiom is going to be in a pretty clear way.

893
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:10,120
And then all of the rest of it just starts falling out.

894
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:17,960
So in a sense, what you have is you have this discovery, which is to see how numbers work

895
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:21,320
when you actually manipulate numbers of things.

896
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,000
So that's discover.

897
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,040
And then this is going to go on three levels.

898
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:33,120
The second level is that you start to formalize it as the language goes and make these abstract

899
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:40,880
mathematical formalisms, which we later learned, thanks to Gödel, are known as axiomatic systems.

900
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:45,920
And then the axiomatic system is something that we invent.

901
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:51,120
And then once you've laid down the axiomatic system, you've now created within abstract

902
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:58,540
space but not real space, a very large number of true statements, in fact, an infinite number

903
01:01:58,540 --> 01:01:59,540
of true statements.

904
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:04,400
So there are lots and lots and lots of true statements that are interesting.

905
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:09,000
And you can then discover those truths within the abstract space.

906
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,300
So it's like one step away from reality.

907
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:18,360
Now why are they so heavily coordinated with what we see in reality when we look back out

908
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,040
of abstract space into reality space?

909
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,520
Well, it's because it was fundamentally empirical in the first place.

910
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:30,380
We started with very easily agreed upon self-evident axioms, created a philosophy that we call

911
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:38,720
a mathematics out of those axioms, and then discover truths within it as an abstract exercise.

912
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:44,640
And then those reflect back very accurately on reality because it's a very tight-knit

913
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:45,640
philosophy.

914
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:51,600
It's a very, very tight-knit philosophy with mostly very basic, easily agreed upon so-called

915
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:56,080
self-evident axioms that there's not a lot of wiggle room or argument to have about them.

916
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:59,160
So I have a very different view of mathematics.

917
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,920
Is it discovered or is it invented?

918
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:06,400
Depends on technically what you mean by mathematics, but the axioms of mathematics are fundamentally

919
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:14,400
… the basic ones are fundamentally discovered … or sorry, yeah, they're empirical, they're

920
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,400
discovered.

921
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:20,640
Then there's an entire axiomatic formal system that's invented to service those axioms,

922
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:24,160
which is called just that axiomatic system.

923
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:27,240
There are truths to be discovered within that on a … I don't want to say a different

924
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:33,280
plane of existence, but it's within abstract space, not within reality space.

925
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,280
So both.

926
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,280
I just find it very …

927
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:40,080
I don't think most people think … Nobody thinks clearly about this stuff.

928
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,720
I read so many things about this.

929
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:42,720
It gets so frustrating.

930
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:45,220
It's so, to me, muddle-headed.

931
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:52,160
Even really brilliant guys like Max Tegmark … I mean, totally a brilliant guy.

932
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:56,080
I don't think I'm in his league, but I read his beliefs that reality is mathematics, and

933
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,880
I'm just like, what the hell are you talking about?

934
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:02,960
How would you define reality?

935
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:08,000
I would say reality is what's out there.

936
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:17,640
Reality is that which is, that's independent of any observer in any meaningful sense.

937
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:22,900
It's objective or subjective, the experience of reality that we are having.

938
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:26,480
The experience of reality is necessarily subjective.

939
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,600
Reality itself is objective.

940
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:32,920
We have a variety of methods that we refer to under the term objectivity that allow us

941
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:37,720
to approximate … I don't want to say approximate.

942
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:42,680
I want to say it allows us to make statements about objective reality, which we don't

943
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:46,840
have any total access to.

944
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:55,400
But those statements are so likely to be reflective of what really happens that we can place bets

945
01:04:55,400 --> 01:05:01,520
on them and win with not only high levels of confidence in some cases, but with measurable

946
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:05,800
levels of confidence in all cases.

947
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:10,920
What's really interesting to me is based on this inherent subjective experience of

948
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:14,560
reality that we are having, if you want to think about the concept of a higher power,

949
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:20,740
a higher being, or God, which to me is a placeholder, we're just using these terms without really

950
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:25,640
understanding them, love is another one, consciousness is another one, waking up people is another

951
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:28,320
one, we just throw these things around.

952
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:34,520
But would it be fair to say that a concept of a God or a higher being is inherently for

953
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:39,920
humans unknowable because it is everything and anything that has any kind of an experience

954
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,560
in the universal and beyond that scale?

955
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:45,080
I mean, yeah.

956
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:50,920
If you want to use the word God to describe that which is beyond one's own capacity

957
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:57,680
for comprehension or that which is beyond even society's total capacity for comprehension,

958
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:58,680
I'm okay with that.

959
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:05,960
I have a friend who sometimes calls it God and sometimes uses the phrase infinity point,

960
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:09,720
which it's interesting that he was calling it that because he didn't really know the

961
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:13,120
math but I actually talked about this a long time ago.

962
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:19,600
When we have an infinite set like the numbers, one, two, three, dot, dot, dot, right?

963
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:24,520
When you have an infinite set, we have this concept that it's infinite, but you can't

964
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:25,960
actually know that it's infinite.

965
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:30,280
In fact, no matter how many numbers you list, we get one, two, three, four, five, six, we

966
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:34,200
could count for a long time and then eventually you still have to put dot, dot, dot.

967
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,160
That dot, dot, dot is the infinity point.

968
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:41,400
It's the point where if you look at numbers, we hit a point where we don't even have ways

969
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,000
to name the numbers anymore.

970
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,920
We don't know how to say them, right?

971
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,880
There is no language for the numbers.

972
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:52,680
You could technically, if you had time, write it down, but there's no language for it.

973
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:57,560
We have what, million, billion, trillion, quadrillion, pentillion and you can go on

974
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:00,640
and on but eventually you run out of terms.

975
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,880
Then you actually get to the point where you physically couldn't write the numbers down

976
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:07,720
and still it turns out all infinity of the numbers are still on the other side of that,

977
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:08,720
right?

978
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,720
In the dot, dot, dot.

979
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:13,080
So the infinity point, calling it the infinity point where you just have to punt and say,

980
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:16,600
well, there's infinitely more.

981
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,400
My friend sometimes identifies that with God, right?

982
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:23,000
I don't know that that's a great metaphor, but it does help.

983
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:29,400
It's very much more Spinoza's God than it is like Christian God or Islamic God or even

984
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,720
a Hindu God or any of these other kinds of deities.

985
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:40,120
It's this idea that there's more out there than we can possibly grasp and I really mean

986
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:42,200
that when I say it with infinity point.

987
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:45,760
We cannot possibly grasp or write down those numbers.

988
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,640
We cannot possibly name them.

989
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:53,200
I mean that with absolute, like not even sincerity, but that is absolutely true.

990
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:58,520
And that's because of our limits of comprehension and cognition, right?

991
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,800
No, it even goes beyond that.

992
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,560
It's also beyond the limits.

993
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:06,760
If you're talking about infinity, it's beyond the limits of physical reality.

994
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:11,220
You take all of the possible quantum states possible in the observable universe and there's

995
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:16,160
only so many and then infinite more numbers are bigger than that, right?

996
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,640
And so there's only so many.

997
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:24,520
So there's some point where you just have to put dot dot dot and all the magic is happening

998
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:27,160
in those three dots.

999
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:32,360
And so within a human though it is, it is our comprehension whether that's individually

1000
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:40,780
within our group of peers or our society or humanity as a whole.

1001
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:44,120
Different levels of course have different kind of ways of looking at knowledge.

1002
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:47,840
But there is this point where it's like, well, it's not that we don't know, it's that we

1003
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:50,180
actually can't know.

1004
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:53,800
And it's you can call that, you know, kind of Spinoza's God.

1005
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:58,880
It's when I said to him, so how do you define reality, I said it's what's out there.

1006
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,520
It's what's out there beyond like this.

1007
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:07,440
You could call God what's out there beyond what we can know is out there.

1008
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:16,360
And fine, but I think it's a bad metaphor because so many different religions are comfortable

1009
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:21,740
using that to say, see, everybody believes in God.

1010
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:26,560
But then the thing that they mean, my God, most people in the world, by definition, human

1011
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:33,120
definition of God, nobody believes in, not nobody, I'm sorry.

1012
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,540
Most people don't believe in any given God.

1013
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:39,560
You pick your favorite God in all of human history, most people haven't believed in it.

1014
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:43,680
Doesn't matter which one it is, Christianity or Islam, you know, we're talking between

1015
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:47,720
them will say it's the same God, you got something like three and change billion people believing

1016
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:48,720
in it.

1017
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:52,220
That leaves four and change billion people who don't right now.

1018
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:55,760
So it's not how that works.

1019
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:00,040
Most people don't believe in any given God.

1020
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:01,580
So you have to be careful.

1021
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:07,360
My argument since like 2014 or so around that has been, look, if you want to call that God,

1022
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:14,000
fine, but you better be ready to acknowledge what you're saying God is, you know, and you've

1023
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:19,440
got to be careful because it allows people who are being a little less scrupulous with

1024
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:24,280
the definitions to play a bait and switch game and say, ah, see, you believe in God,

1025
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:25,960
you're an atheist and you believe in God.

1026
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:32,080
And what you mean is this like very abstract kind of what I can't know that which is beyond

1027
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:39,160
me, that which is always bigger than me, that which is inherently beyond my control and

1028
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:45,440
a belief that it works out or something as much of the time that all that stuff is not

1029
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:48,760
the same thing as, you know, what you read about in the Old Testament.

1030
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:50,120
No, it's just not the same thing.

1031
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,120
Absolutely.

1032
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:57,560
The gods of Old Testament and Quran and the human God has been, to me, created for the

1033
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:03,440
sake of power, capitalize on it for power, the way that Christianity became the unity

1034
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:06,520
of church and state to get into politics.

1035
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:13,160
It has nothing to do with what, for example, mystics and Sufis or, you know, if you meditate

1036
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:17,780
or whatever it is that you want to do, or if you want to focus on philosophical aspect

1037
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:19,560
of artificial intelligence.

1038
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:24,120
That was one of the reasons that I asked, is it by nature unknowable, the infinity that

1039
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:25,120
you're talking about?

1040
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:29,560
Because some of the argument is that, well, maybe if we have a higher cognition ability

1041
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:33,820
in a form of whether artificial general intelligence or something beyond that, beyond the point

1042
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:36,780
of singularity, then that can't be known.

1043
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:39,840
But you were saying that it's unknowable by nature.

1044
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:40,960
There's always an unknowable.

1045
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,780
There's actually a short story and I'm trying to think of who it's by.

1046
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:51,760
It's one of the very famous writers, I cannot think of who it's by, but it's, somebody will

1047
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:55,240
be able to figure it out and tell us at some point.

1048
01:11:55,240 --> 01:12:00,560
But it talks about, it's essentially that they built this AI machine and they ask it

1049
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:05,080
the same question over and over again, like what is the nature of reality or whatever.

1050
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:10,520
And it's trying to compute and it says, you know, insufficient data or whatever.

1051
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:15,160
And then the machine gets upgraded to an even more powerful machine and it talks at each

1052
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:19,800
stage, like there's five or six stages, about how incredibly powerful it is now and how

1053
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:25,160
incredibly, like the hard, hard questions it can answer that are just unbelievably complicated.

1054
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:30,200
And it's like, you know, it keeps going stage after stage and then it gets asked, you know,

1055
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:32,400
what is the ultimate nature of reality or whatever.

1056
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:38,240
And it's like, you know, more data needed, can't compute.

1057
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:45,680
And then it says that by the time that it finally, you know, becomes like AGI would,

1058
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:49,500
it has the ability to build itself and to marshal resources to its own calculational

1059
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:50,840
powers and everything.

1060
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:55,240
And so it takes it out basically to the heat death of the universe and it has gathered

1061
01:12:55,240 --> 01:13:00,280
all possible information to itself.

1062
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:04,060
And the question is posed, you know, what's the ultimate nature of reality?

1063
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:08,360
And it's now got the, it literally is the only thing in the universe, right?

1064
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:10,640
It's become the entire universe.

1065
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:13,560
And it says, let there be light.

1066
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:16,560
Oh, that's amazing.

1067
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:20,480
This is by one of the big writers, Asimov or something like that, right?

1068
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:21,480
It's really worth reading.

1069
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,480
It takes like 20 minutes.

1070
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:31,160
I think it was Asimov that wrote it, but, so even if you had this super intelligent

1071
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:35,760
artificial intelligence, the infinity point still exists.

1072
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:38,480
Infinity really is infinity.

1073
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:43,480
There's a funny saying that people who study mathematics learn, which is that all numbers

1074
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:45,900
are smaller than most.

1075
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:49,760
And so it doesn't matter how many numbers, how, you know, whatever number you think is

1076
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:55,000
a big number, immediately I can say, well, think of a number 10 times that big, right?

1077
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,360
And your number is not that big of a number.

1078
01:13:56,360 --> 01:14:01,080
Or I could say, think of a number a trillion times that big and your number is now very

1079
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,080
small.

1080
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:05,680
And, you know, and you, of course a trillion was also very small, so you can start thinking

1081
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:10,240
about how that stacks up and multiplies on itself to the point where it becomes very

1082
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:15,600
quick to understand that all numbers are in fact very small compared to most numbers,

1083
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:20,520
which all live in the dot, dot, dot to infinity.

1084
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:23,320
And that's a limitation of physical reality.

1085
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:27,840
So no artificial intelligence could surpass that.

1086
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,440
So there's always an unknowable.

1087
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:35,800
There's always an unknowable and there's always a bigger than whatever.

1088
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:36,800
Even in the story.

1089
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:41,920
And like I said, I'm almost sure it's Asimov now, but I'm not gonna, I wouldn't bet anything

1090
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:42,920
on it.

1091
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:43,920
We'll confirm.

1092
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:44,920
Yeah.

1093
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:45,920
We'll confirm that.

1094
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:51,240
In that story, it literally takes all the way until it has every conceivable resource

1095
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:58,400
of the whole universe dedicated to its computational task, at which point it becomes God and starts

1096
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,400
the universe over.

1097
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,400
Wow.

1098
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:01,400
That was amazing.

1099
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:02,400
That was awesome.

1100
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,400
It's a pretty cool story.

1101
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,400
Very.

1102
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:06,400
Yeah.

1103
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,400
Very.

1104
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,160
I have to think even more about it.

1105
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:12,160
Let's wrap this up since you have stuff to do.

1106
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:16,240
What's next for you and where can our audience follow your work?

1107
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:18,280
Well, the follow is easy.

1108
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,280
So I'll say that first.

1109
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:25,960
You can find me on Twitter at Conceptual James and I have a website that's NewDiscourses.com

1110
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:30,800
and it's kind of a repository for pretty much everything that I'm doing.

1111
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:35,200
And also it answers the other question, what's next for me?

1112
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:36,600
Most of what's next is there.

1113
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:43,720
I do have a book coming out on August, I think, 25th, Pandemic, depending, called Cynical

1114
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:49,040
Theories written with Helen Pluckrose that traces the postmodern elements of social justice

1115
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:53,520
theory and explains how it is an evolution of postmodernism that we're dealing with

1116
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,400
in the woke movement today.

1117
01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:03,840
But on New Discourses, I'm trying to, I'm literally trying to lay out a comprehensive

1118
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:09,040
picture of as much of that movement as I possibly can going into rather tremendous levels of

1119
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,040
depth.

1120
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:16,680
And I'm primarily spending my time writing what I've called social justice encyclopedia.

1121
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:22,080
So it focuses not on all the topics relevant to social justice, but just on the terminology.

1122
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:25,800
So I'm trying to explain the way that they use words and the way that their mindset is

1123
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:29,560
rooted in the way that they use words and make it very, very clear.

1124
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:36,880
When they say such and such was a racist incident or we need diversity or whatever, or as we

1125
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:41,960
talked about earlier, non-consensual co-platforming, what in the world does this stuff really mean?

1126
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:45,200
So I'm trying to build that out.

1127
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:48,520
It's going to take me the better part of another year, year and a half to finish it, but there

1128
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:54,720
is a metric ton of useful information there now.

1129
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:56,040
People are reporting to me all the time.

1130
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:59,640
For example, they get in these discussions or arguments or whatever they get into online

1131
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:04,960
or they see these posts that people make and are like, oh, blah, blah, blah, diversity

1132
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:10,960
initiative, and then they can go to my encyclopedia to where I've defined the term diversity,

1133
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,980
and they can just take it and post, well, that term means more than what most people

1134
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:15,980
understand it to mean.

1135
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:19,960
This is a pretty comprehensive summary, and they post the link to the encyclopedia so

1136
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:21,440
people can understand it.

1137
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:28,320
My goal, by the way, with that is and always has been to make sure, look, maybe social

1138
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,240
justice, I don't think it's right.

1139
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:34,520
I think it's a catastrophe, but what I think doesn't matter because I'm a person and I

1140
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,400
mess up.

1141
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:40,200
I think that people should be able to make a decision about social justice, but they

1142
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:44,920
should have to make the decision informed rather than uninformed, or ideally they should

1143
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:50,000
be making a decision in an informed capacity rather than an uninformed capacity.

1144
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,800
My feeling is that the movement is selling itself as one thing when it's actually something

1145
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:59,740
very different, and if people understood it better, they could make a better decision

1146
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:00,960
about what they would want to do with it.

1147
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:07,480
I think most people, overwhelmingly most people, north of 90% of people would agree with me

1148
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:12,620
that implementing social justice as the movement is pushing it is a bad idea.

1149
01:18:12,620 --> 01:18:15,200
Social justice as a concept is a different thing.

1150
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:18,520
You can read about that on the encyclopedia too.

1151
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:22,080
I think most people would reject it if they understood it, so I'm trying to help people

1152
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,080
understand it.

1153
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:24,080
That's awesome.

1154
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:27,200
I hope I can have you back on the show when your book is out.

1155
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:29,200
We talk a little more about that.

1156
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:30,360
Let me ask you the last question.

1157
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:36,160
I ask all my guests that if you come across an intelligent alien from a different civilization,

1158
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:40,440
what would you say is the worst thing humanity has done, and what would you say is our greatest

1159
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:44,720
achievement?

1160
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:48,560
That is a hard question.

1161
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:52,000
Those are really, really hard questions.

1162
01:18:52,000 --> 01:19:02,160
I would honestly say that our greatest achievement, that one's easier, was the recognition of

1163
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:05,880
fundamentally liberal principles, and I mean this in a very specific way.

1164
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:12,880
I see liberalism as a means of conflict management that tries to minimize subjective influence

1165
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:19,120
because everybody has self-interest involved in their perspectives on conflict.

1166
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:24,320
The attempt to make our conflict management, whether it's in knowledge, whether it's

1167
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:29,960
in law, whether it's in other arenas, as objective as possible, which isn't to say perfectly

1168
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:36,160
objective, has probably been humanity's greatest achievement.

1169
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:41,920
It's no small thing to have arrived there.

1170
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:48,760
I don't know what humanity's greatest error would be, but if I had to try to talk in kind

1171
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:55,840
of blurry lines about it, it would be that we were unable to realize until we really

1172
01:19:55,840 --> 01:20:04,080
messed it up that global conquest is not good.

1173
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:10,520
The idea that going to take over other territory and call it your own by force or by other

1174
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:17,240
kind of seditious methods is really not good.

1175
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:23,680
That is a huge, huge thing that I think of, to be honest with you, I think of World War

1176
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:30,120
II, and the story of this isn't actually over, but I think of World War II as the West's

1177
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:42,200
coming to terms with the fact that the colonial or imperial project is not compatible with

1178
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:44,400
advanced technology.

1179
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:49,000
That's why I get really worried when I see nations right now, such as China, which are

1180
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:55,000
blatantly colonizing, because they haven't seemed to have learned the lesson.

1181
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:04,560
The big lesson there was definitely that colonizing the other territory, especially by force,

1182
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:08,840
is not compatible with a society that develops advanced technology.

1183
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:13,240
I guess if you're going around with horses and bows and arrows, maybe it's one story,

1184
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:20,640
but when you have tanks and aircraft and nuclear weapons, it's another story altogether.

1185
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:26,120
I would say that the greatest triumph then is the development of fundamentally liberal

1186
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:33,640
principles and the greatest failure is the belief that which one can take for their own

1187
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:34,640
is their own.

1188
01:21:34,640 --> 01:22:01,280
Of course, those two things are at odds.
