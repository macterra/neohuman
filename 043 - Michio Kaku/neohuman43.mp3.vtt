00:00.000 --> 00:05.440
because we are sentient, because we have self-consciousness, we are masters of our

00:05.440 --> 00:13.760
fate. And I think one possible destiny for us is to become a star-faring species, that is,

00:13.760 --> 00:27.440
to reach for the stars. Hello and welcome to the 43rd episode of Neohuman Podcast. I'm a

00:27.440 --> 00:33.200
Gabbahari etygologist on Twitter and Instagram, and you can follow the show on liveinlimbo.com,

00:33.200 --> 00:41.640
iTunes, and YouTube. My guest this week is Dr. Michio Kaku. Welcome to the show, Dr. Kaku. Okay,

00:41.640 --> 00:46.440
well glad to be on. Thank you. Why don't we start with your background, the work you've done, and

00:46.440 --> 00:52.640
what are you focused on now these days? Currently, I work on something called string theory. I'm the

00:52.640 --> 00:57.800
co-founder of string field theory, which is one of the main formulations of the theory. And we want

00:57.800 --> 01:03.760
to get the theory down to a one-inch equation that will allow us to fulfill Einstein's dream of,

01:03.760 --> 01:10.560
quote, reading the mind of God. Now, string theory in its present-day form, there are five

01:10.560 --> 01:14.880
different string theories, and each one can be summarized by string field theory. In fact,

01:14.880 --> 01:20.840
that equation is my equation. However, my equation is about an inch and a half long. We want to get

01:20.840 --> 01:28.440
it down even further and allow membranes to coexist. This is called M theory, and that's even a more

01:28.440 --> 01:34.000
advanced version of string theory. So right now, some of the brightest minds on earth are working

01:34.000 --> 01:41.360
on M theory to try to find the ultimate formulation of the theory of everything. And how is the work

01:41.360 --> 01:48.080
progressing? Well, pretty good. We have a pretty good handle on string theory in ten dimensions. Ten

01:48.080 --> 01:52.880
dimensions is the dimension I usually work in. However, we now know from the work of people at

01:52.880 --> 01:59.440
Princeton that there is an eleven-dimensional model out there, and we want to find the reformulation

01:59.440 --> 02:04.320
of string theory in terms of eleven dimensions. That's really hard, because eleven dimensions,

02:04.320 --> 02:09.840
they are membranes, and membranes are much more difficult to work with than strings. And so,

02:09.840 --> 02:16.680
like I said, some of the brightest minds on earth now are trying to understand M theory. M for

02:16.680 --> 02:23.040
mystery, magic, or membranes. You have a new book. I want to talk extensively about that. But before

02:23.040 --> 02:27.920
that, I'm just wondering, I read a couple of years ago that physics is turning into a philosophy,

02:27.920 --> 02:32.360
because there are a lot of theories that are very difficult or close to impossible to prove. What

02:32.360 --> 02:37.840
do you think about that? Well, that's a valid criticism, because physics should be based on

02:37.840 --> 02:44.240
things that are testable, reproducible, and falsifiable. However, now we're after bigger

02:44.240 --> 02:50.200
game. We're after the theory of everything, the theory of the entire universe. Each solution of

02:50.200 --> 02:56.680
string theory is an entire universe. A direct proof of that would require creating a baby universe in

02:56.680 --> 03:02.280
the laboratory. In other words, to become God. Now, we can't do that, of course, but look at how

03:02.280 --> 03:08.400
science is done. Science is done indirectly. Now, we know, for example, that the Sun is made out of

03:08.400 --> 03:15.280
hydrogen. How do we know that? How do we know that the Sun is made out of hydrogen? No one's been to

03:15.280 --> 03:20.760
the Sun. We've never sent a space probe to the Sun. So how do we know? Because we analyze echoes,

03:20.760 --> 03:26.640
echoes from the Sun called sunlight. And by analyzing sunlight, we know the Sun is made out

03:26.640 --> 03:32.000
of hydrogen. In the same way, we will prove the correctness of string theory and M theory by

03:32.000 --> 03:37.960
looking at echoes from the 11th dimension. Amazing. Your new book is called The Future of

03:37.960 --> 03:44.880
Humanity, Terraforming Mars, Interstellar Travel Immortality and Our Destiny Beyond Earth. How

03:44.880 --> 03:49.920
many books have you written before this? Because you've been writing for many years. Well, yeah,

03:49.920 --> 03:55.800
I've written about 15 books. Four of them are New York Times bestsellers. In fact, the book The

03:55.800 --> 04:01.200
Future of Humanity just hit the New York Times bestseller list just a few days ago. Fantastic.

04:01.200 --> 04:05.440
Congratulations. Well, thank you. Many of the other books I've written, however, offer PhD

04:05.440 --> 04:13.240
physics students. So if you are a third or fourth year grad student in physics, then you can take

04:13.240 --> 04:19.160
some of my textbooks, which are for PhD students. However, that requires five years of calculus and

04:19.160 --> 04:27.000
six years of ordinary physics until you become a third year grad student. So what made you interested

04:27.000 --> 04:32.320
to write about the future of humanity at this point? Well, it all started when I was eight

04:32.320 --> 04:37.720
years old. Everything started when I was eight. They announced that a great scientist had just

04:37.720 --> 04:44.560
died and they flashed a picture of his desk with the unfinished manuscript of his greatest work.

04:44.560 --> 04:50.680
Now, I was fascinated by that story. I didn't know who this man was. I just knew that he couldn't

04:50.680 --> 04:55.800
finish something. So I said to myself, well, gee, what's the homework problem, right? Couldn't he

04:55.800 --> 05:02.040
ask his mother? I mean, what's so hard that you can't finish it? So I said to myself, I want to

05:02.040 --> 05:08.240
learn about this man. I want to learn about what he couldn't finish. Then I found out the man's

05:08.240 --> 05:13.840
name was Albert Einstein. And he was working on the unified field theory, the theory of everything.

05:13.840 --> 05:18.640
And then I went to the library to find out more about the unified field theory. And I found

05:18.640 --> 05:29.640
nothing, absolutely nothing, not one book, not one reference to explain to me the unified field

05:29.640 --> 05:35.400
theory. So I said to myself, when I grow up, and I become a professor of theoretical physics, I want

05:35.400 --> 05:44.320
to at least at least write books for myself, for the kid that I used to be, so that I would be able

05:44.320 --> 05:50.240
to access the unified field theory. And so I said to myself, well, if no one else is going to write

05:50.240 --> 05:55.600
those books, I'll write them. And that's what I do. I mean, I've written some of the the earliest

05:55.600 --> 06:00.360
books on string theory. But how can you predict what's coming in the future? I'm just wondering.

06:00.360 --> 06:06.880
Well, I'm a physicist. And I know that you cannot absolutely predict the future. All you can do is

06:06.880 --> 06:16.800
predict trends based on what you know, physics. Now, in 1900, there was a contest basically, to

06:16.800 --> 06:22.520
predict the next 100 years. And these predictions were hilarious. Some people predicted that we

06:22.520 --> 06:28.880
would have blimps, fleets of blimps to go across the Atlantic Ocean. Now, why were these predictions

06:28.880 --> 06:35.720
of 1900 so wrong? They didn't know that they were four fundamental laws, forces of the universe.

06:35.720 --> 06:41.260
Today, we know that today we know that there are four fundamental forces like gravity,

06:41.260 --> 06:47.480
electromagnetism, which makes light bulbs possible and computers. And then we have the two nuclear

06:47.480 --> 06:52.720
forces, the weak and the strong nuclear force, which lights up the sun, for example, we didn't

06:52.720 --> 06:59.080
know that in 1900. And that's why some of the predictions are crazy. Today, we do know the four

06:59.080 --> 07:03.800
fundamental laws. And so the predictions we make, yeah, we're going to make bloopers, we're going to

07:03.800 --> 07:11.280
still make mistakes, but they will be based on sound fundamental physics. That's the difference

07:11.280 --> 07:19.600
between predictions now and predictions in 1900. So to predict the future of humanity, first we

07:19.600 --> 07:26.200
need to define what humanity is today. How would you define what is a human today and how this

07:26.200 --> 07:31.680
definition is going to evolve in the future? Well, we think that humans are homo sapiens,

07:31.680 --> 07:39.280
but we're different from the other creatures on the planet earth. 99.9% of all species on the earth

07:39.280 --> 07:45.720
have gone extinct. If you don't believe me, dig underneath your feet, right underneath your feet,

07:45.720 --> 07:54.320
and you'll meet the bones of the 99.9% of species that never made it. Extinction is the norm for

07:54.320 --> 08:01.320
all life forms on the planet earth. Now, we're different. We have a big brain. We can perhaps

08:01.320 --> 08:07.400
change our destiny. So our species is unique among all the other species, because after all,

08:07.400 --> 08:13.840
the dinosaurs did not have a space program. And because the dinosaurs did not have a space

08:13.840 --> 08:19.160
program, they're not here today to talk about it. They got wiped out when that meteor or comet hit

08:19.160 --> 08:26.840
Mexico 65 million years ago. But we do have a big brain. We do have rocket ships. We do have a space

08:26.840 --> 08:34.120
program. And so we're in a position to defeat the odds of nature. That nature says all life forms

08:34.120 --> 08:41.640
must eventually die, except maybe us, homo sapiens. And how do you see the role of technology in who

08:41.640 --> 08:49.480
we are today? Well, we have to ask ourselves, where did civilization, wealth and prosperity

08:49.480 --> 08:56.360
come from? You know, 300 years ago, the average person lived to be about 35 or 40. They didn't

08:56.360 --> 09:01.720
live very long. It was a hard life. You had kids and then you died. Life was a bitch back then.

09:01.720 --> 09:08.280
What happened? What happened was 200 years ago, we physicists worked out the laws of thermodynamics.

09:08.280 --> 09:14.640
That made possible the steam engine. And the steam engine made possible the locomotive, factories,

09:14.640 --> 09:19.520
and the Industrial Revolution. And then 80 years after that, we physicists worked out

09:19.520 --> 09:26.640
electromagnetism, which made possible the electric age. All of a sudden, we had dynamos and generators

09:26.640 --> 09:32.640
and light bulbs and television. 80 years after that, we physicists invented the computer,

09:32.640 --> 09:40.080
the transistor and the laser beam. And with the transistor, we ushered in the high tech age.

09:40.080 --> 09:47.040
And now we are undergoing the fourth wave of wealth generation. And that is artificial

09:47.040 --> 09:53.600
intelligence, biotech and nanotech. And once again, physics is helping to lead the way

09:53.600 --> 09:57.360
into the future. How do you feel about AI, artificial intelligence?

09:58.240 --> 10:05.440
Well, there's a debate between Elon Musk of SpaceX and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook.

10:05.440 --> 10:12.480
Mark Zuckerberg says that robots are going to open up new pathways for prosperity, jobs,

10:12.480 --> 10:20.080
industry, and it'll be beneficial for society. Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla Motors says,

10:20.080 --> 10:26.800
not so fast, not so fast. What happens when the robots take over? That could be a huge mistake

10:26.800 --> 10:32.160
on the part of humanity. So I was on CNN on the Quest show, and I was asked that question,

10:32.160 --> 10:40.880
who's right? My position is both are right to a degree. Zuckerberg is right that for the

10:40.880 --> 10:47.440
next several decades, there are billionaires waiting to be minted. There are industries

10:47.440 --> 10:54.160
waiting to be revolutionized. Jobs, industry, economic activity will come with artificial

10:54.160 --> 11:00.320
intelligence. But let's not be naive. There's a certain point at which robots become

11:00.320 --> 11:06.480
dangerous. That point is when they become self-aware. Now, robots do not know their robots.

11:07.600 --> 11:13.760
If you compare them to an animal, they would barely compare to a cockroach.

11:13.760 --> 11:19.280
Cockroaches can just barely walk across the room. That's the level of intelligence of most of our

11:19.280 --> 11:27.520
robots. However, in the coming decades, robots will become as smart as a mouse, then a rat,

11:28.240 --> 11:36.560
then a rabbit, then a cat, then a dog, and finally a monkey. Now, monkeys are self-aware.

11:36.560 --> 11:46.080
They know they are not humans. Now, dogs are confused. Dogs think that, well, humans are dogs

11:46.080 --> 11:52.400
too. We're the top dog, and they're the underdog, and that's why they obey us, because they think

11:52.400 --> 11:58.800
we're the top dog. Now, monkeys aren't that stupid. Monkeys know they are not human. But so when

11:58.800 --> 12:03.200
robots become as smart as a monkey, I think we should put a chip in their brain to shut them off

12:03.200 --> 12:07.760
if they have murderous thoughts. How would that work out with ethics and morality though,

12:07.760 --> 12:12.640
because if something is self-conscious, within that thing, whatever that may be,

12:12.640 --> 12:19.440
has the right to express itself? Well, yes and no. But at the present time, robots do not have

12:19.440 --> 12:26.080
rights. I think robots will eventually have rights, and that point is when robots suffer pain.

12:26.720 --> 12:32.560
You see, pain is very important for us to exist. People who are born without pain sensors usually

12:32.560 --> 12:38.800
have their fingers and toes amputated, because you take all sorts of risks and do dangerous things

12:38.800 --> 12:44.320
and not know it, because you have no pain sensors. So eventually, robots are going to have to have

12:44.320 --> 12:48.800
pain sensors. They're going to have to feel pain. Otherwise, they're going to try to do feats of

12:48.800 --> 12:53.920
superhuman ability and destroy themselves. And so robots will eventually be equipped with pain

12:53.920 --> 13:00.480
sensors. At that point, I think we should think about the ethics of robots, because you don't want

13:00.480 --> 13:07.760
to make robots suffer unnecessarily. Because if you are a human, yes, there are sadists among us

13:08.320 --> 13:14.400
who will want to torture animals and who will want to torture robots once they can feel pain.

13:14.400 --> 13:20.960
So I think eventually, we're going to have to look at the rights, the robotic rights of robots. But

13:20.960 --> 13:26.400
that's still many decades into the future. But eventually, I think we will have to have robot

13:26.400 --> 13:32.720
ethics. One of the arguments in favor of controlling artificial intelligence advancement is that to

13:32.720 --> 13:37.920
make it more human, or in a way put our ethics and morality within the machine. And I've always

13:37.920 --> 13:43.760
wondered, do we really know where our ethics and morality come from? Are ethics and morality

13:43.760 --> 13:49.120
objective or subjective and interpreted depending on the individual ability to process information?

13:49.120 --> 13:56.960
Well, I think Galileo said it the best several hundred years ago. He was asked about ethics,

13:56.960 --> 14:04.560
religion, science and all that. And he said the purpose of science is to determine how the heavens

14:04.560 --> 14:14.000
go. The purpose of religion is to determine how to go to heaven. So in other words, science is about

14:14.000 --> 14:23.120
natural law. It's about discovering the laws of nature. Religion is about ethics, about how to go

14:23.120 --> 14:28.800
to heaven, how to be a good person, the golden rule, how to be nice, how to treat other people

14:28.800 --> 14:35.120
nice. And so if you want to know what ethics is, it's relative to the tribe. Whatever holds the

14:35.120 --> 14:41.680
tribe together is considered good. Okay. And so that's why ethics changes from tribe to tribe,

14:41.680 --> 14:48.080
because it's relative to the glue that holds the tribe together. So I think evolutionarily speaking,

14:48.720 --> 14:55.920
that religion was good for us, because back in the caveman days, if you were becoming intelligent,

14:56.400 --> 15:01.440
you bad mouthed the leader, you hijacked the leader, you killed the leader to take over the

15:01.440 --> 15:06.320
tribe because you were smarter than him. So I think tribes of our ancestors fell apart.

15:06.320 --> 15:11.600
Intelligence is quite corrosive and quite divisive. You bring five people together,

15:11.600 --> 15:18.240
you get six points of view. And so I think tribes that were based on intelligence fell apart and

15:18.240 --> 15:24.080
died. They're not here today. They left their genes in the gene pool. The genes that survived

15:24.640 --> 15:31.920
were the genes of people that had religion, a glue of ethics that held the tribe together.

15:31.920 --> 15:37.520
We are descended from them. That's why if you are a Martian landing on the planet earth,

15:37.520 --> 15:43.200
you'll realize that every society on the planet earth has a religion, because religion is a glue,

15:43.200 --> 15:49.520
is ethics. It's about how to become a good person, how to go to heaven, how to hold the tribe

15:49.520 --> 15:55.600
together. How do you see the role of religion today? Well, in our early days, I think religion

15:55.600 --> 16:01.360
had an extremely positive aspect to it, because it kept us together, because there was no science

16:01.360 --> 16:07.520
back in those days. I think there's a gene for religion, a God gene. I think there is a God

16:07.520 --> 16:15.120
gene. There's no science gene. There's no let's pick this apart gene. No, the genes for jumping

16:15.120 --> 16:20.320
to conclusion, for making outrageous conclusions, for guessing. Yeah, there's probably a gene for

16:20.320 --> 16:28.240
that. But there's no gene for science. Science is an acquired taste. You have to learn about science

16:28.240 --> 16:35.600
the hard way by making all sorts of mistakes. And so I think in the early days, we needed religion.

16:35.600 --> 16:41.840
Religion and science were dialectical. You could not have intelligent apes without religion keeping

16:41.840 --> 16:48.240
the tribe together. But after a while, when we discover industry, we discover the four or five

16:48.240 --> 16:55.840
industry, we discover the four fundamental laws, we discover hydrogen warheads, then science has to

16:55.840 --> 17:02.160
deal with ethical questions for the first time. It's no longer just creating a science experiment.

17:02.160 --> 17:10.240
No, it's destroying the human race. That's the power of science. And so religion is bad if it

17:10.240 --> 17:17.600
fosters divisiveness, sectarianism, fundamentalism. But it could be good if it fosters humanitarianism.

17:17.600 --> 17:25.120
And fosters knowledge and growth and democracy. So I think that in the old days, yeah, religion was

17:25.120 --> 17:32.560
good for us, even if it was outrageously mystical and outrageously irrational. Today, it's a double

17:32.560 --> 17:38.160
edged sword. It could hold the tribe together, or it could also destroy the tribe. Can it also be

17:38.160 --> 17:43.840
considered an obstacle on the way of science? Let's consider, for example, immortality,

17:43.840 --> 17:50.000
which is a very big deal if you reach it. And I know you talk about it in a book. But from a

17:50.000 --> 17:56.240
Christian point of view, or any other monotheistic religion point of view, you you're born and then

17:56.240 --> 18:01.600
you die and then you get rewarded or punished. So how would this work, especially in a democracy

18:01.600 --> 18:09.280
where anybody's vote is equal to the other person? Well, in a democracy, people get to choose their

18:09.280 --> 18:14.400
destiny, right? Not a king, not a queen, not a dictator, but people begin to choose their own

18:14.400 --> 18:21.520
destiny. And I think that immortality, or at least partial immortality, is definitely in the cards

18:21.520 --> 18:28.480
in two ways. First is digital immortality. And the second is genetic or biologic immortality. So

18:28.480 --> 18:33.520
let's break them down. Digital immortality is when you digitize everything known about your digital

18:33.520 --> 18:40.480
fingerprints. Already in Silicon Valley, there are companies offering, for a price, digital,

18:40.480 --> 18:44.800
a form of digital immortality. Everything known about you, your credit card transactions,

18:46.880 --> 18:53.600
your Instagram photographs, your emails, everything in your digital fingerprint can be compiled.

18:53.600 --> 18:58.800
So then in the future, when you go to the library, instead of getting a book about Winston Churchill,

18:58.800 --> 19:05.120
you'll talk to Winston Churchill. All his mannerisms, all his memories, all his speeches

19:05.120 --> 19:11.200
will be recorded and digitized. I would love to talk to Einstein. I would love an opportunity

19:11.200 --> 19:17.440
to talk to a digitized Einstein that digitized all his works, all his theories, all his speeches,

19:17.440 --> 19:23.760
all his videos, all of it digitized. In fact, I think that you will be able to talk to your

19:23.760 --> 19:30.000
great, great, great, great, great, great grandkids because their ancestors have been digitized. Now,

19:30.000 --> 19:37.280
once we digitize you, you are in some sense immortal. And what do we do with it? I think

19:37.280 --> 19:42.560
we should put it on a laser beam and shoot it into outer space. In one second, your consciousness

19:42.560 --> 19:50.160
will be on the moon. In 15 minutes, your consciousness will be on Mars. In four years,

19:50.160 --> 19:56.560
you'll be on Alpha Centauri, the nearest star. Now, let me stick my neck out. I think this already

19:56.560 --> 20:02.240
exists. I call this laser porting. It's much more efficient than flying saucers. And I think this

20:02.240 --> 20:07.360
already exists. I think aliens in outer space probably laser port their consciousness across

20:07.360 --> 20:12.640
the galaxy at the speed of light. They don't bother with rockets, with weightlessness,

20:13.200 --> 20:18.880
with rocket accidents and cosmic rays and accidents. They don't bother with that. They

20:18.880 --> 20:22.560
simply digitize themselves and shoot their consciousness across the galaxy.

20:23.200 --> 20:28.560
It's really interesting to me that when we're talking about certain things like becoming a

20:28.560 --> 20:35.120
multi-planetary species, you're a theoretical physicist, you talk about it, and then you see

20:35.120 --> 20:40.560
someone like Stanley Kubrick also make a movie about it, Space Odyssey, which is basically about

20:40.560 --> 20:45.680
becoming a multi-planetary species, correct? Yeah. In fact, in the first 10 minutes of the movie,

20:45.680 --> 20:50.080
he actually had talking heads. He had physicists, some of them acquaintances of mine,

20:50.080 --> 20:55.840
who were interviewed about extraterrestrial civilizations. But then at the last minute,

20:55.840 --> 21:01.200
at the last minute, Kubrick cut the first 10 minutes of his own film. And so the film became

21:01.200 --> 21:08.160
somewhat mystical. However, today it is still perhaps the most logically consistent encounter

21:08.160 --> 21:13.520
with an extraterrestrial civilization. More than likely, an extraterrestrial civilization will

21:13.520 --> 21:19.600
explore the galaxy with robots, self-replicating von Neumann probes that land on the moon,

21:20.400 --> 21:26.560
like the monolith in the movie. On the moon, they create copies of themselves and they shoot out

21:26.560 --> 21:32.720
to land on other moons and make copies of themselves again from the lunar soil. And that way,

21:32.720 --> 21:40.000
from one monolith, you can get two, then 10, then 1,000, dot, dot, dot, an exponential growth of

21:40.000 --> 21:47.680
these things. And you can therefore analyze the entire galaxy in 100,000 years. So on our moon,

21:47.680 --> 21:53.520
I wouldn't be a bit surprised if on our moon there is evidence of an ancient visitation

21:53.520 --> 22:02.160
because the moon has no rust, no erosion, no water to speak of. It's the ideal place to put a probe,

22:02.160 --> 22:09.280
a von Neumann probe, that simply monitors our solar system. So I think that movie, 2001,

22:09.280 --> 22:15.040
is perhaps the most realistic encounter with extraterrestrial intelligence. Now, to be fair,

22:15.040 --> 22:20.080
I get emails from people who say nonsense. I've been abducted, they say, by aliens from outer

22:20.080 --> 22:26.560
space. I've been on their flying saucers, so I know what aliens are like. My advice to you is,

22:26.560 --> 22:32.880
if you've been abducted by aliens from outer space, my advice to you is, steal something.

22:32.880 --> 22:39.840
An alien paperweight, a chip, a scissors, anything. Steal something, because there's no law against

22:39.840 --> 22:44.800
stealing from an extraterrestrial civilization. No law to prevent you. You're not going to go to

22:44.800 --> 22:49.920
jail stealing from an alien. And you'll have bragging rights afterwards. And you'll have

22:49.920 --> 22:55.920
something that is testable, falsifiable, and reproducible. That's the hallmark of true science.

22:56.720 --> 23:01.520
There seems to be a similarity between those who think they've been abducted by aliens and those

23:01.520 --> 23:06.800
who think they spoke to God to become a Chosen One. It always happens when no one else is around.

23:07.760 --> 23:13.360
Yeah. And look, I don't dispute the fact that these people believe that. You put them in a

23:13.360 --> 23:19.280
lie detector test, they'll probably come out smelling like a rose. My only thing is that science

23:19.280 --> 23:25.440
is based on things that are testable, falsifiable, and reproducible. And things like proving the

23:25.440 --> 23:32.720
existence of God is outside of our testability. Therefore, these questions like miracles, angels,

23:32.720 --> 23:38.320
gods, and things like that, maybe they exist, maybe they don't. But science says nothing about

23:38.320 --> 23:44.080
them, because they're not testable, falsifiable, and reproducible. Is there any big picture objective

23:44.080 --> 23:50.560
or rather philosophy for science and technology? Could perhaps becoming a type one civilization on

23:50.560 --> 23:56.720
the Kardashev scale be considered the objective? Yeah, we are about 100 years from becoming type

23:56.720 --> 24:03.040
one. A type one civilization is planetary. They control the weather, for example. They control

24:03.040 --> 24:09.440
planetary energy, like Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers, about 100 years in the future. Then we have type

24:09.440 --> 24:16.800
two, which is stellar. They control the output of entire stars. They play with stars, like Star

24:16.800 --> 24:22.560
Trek. Star Trek would be a typical type two civilization. Then there's type three, which is

24:22.560 --> 24:28.160
galactic, which means they control black holes. They control the black hole at the center of the

24:28.160 --> 24:35.120
galaxy. They roam the galactic space lanes. Now, what are we on this cosmic scale? Are we controlling

24:35.120 --> 24:42.080
the weather? Are we playing with the sun? Do we roam the galactic space lanes? No, we're type zero.

24:42.080 --> 24:47.680
We get energy from dead plants, but we are about 100 years from becoming type one. For example,

24:47.680 --> 24:54.480
what is the internet? The internet is the first type one technology to land in the 21st century,

24:54.960 --> 25:00.960
so we're privileged to be alive to see the birth of the first type one technology. What language

25:00.960 --> 25:06.560
will they speak? Well, already on the earth, the two most popular languages on the internet are

25:06.560 --> 25:14.240
English and Mandarin Chinese. What music will they listen to? Well, we already have a planetary

25:14.240 --> 25:20.560
youth music called rock and roll. We already have the Olympics, the planetary sports. We already have

25:21.200 --> 25:26.720
the beginning of planetary fashion with Chanel and Gucci. We're seeing the birth of a planetary

25:26.720 --> 25:33.280
culture and a planetary energy source right before our eyes, but this transition is the most

25:33.280 --> 25:38.640
dangerous of all. As Elon Musk has said, maybe they're out there, but maybe they blew themselves

25:38.640 --> 25:48.160
apart. So, we are still mired in the swamp. We have all the savagery of our rise from the swamp.

25:48.160 --> 25:53.760
We have sectarianism, fundamentalism, anti-scientism. We have all these horrible

25:53.760 --> 26:01.520
isms facing us, but once we hit type one, then we become planetary, and then we become

26:01.520 --> 26:08.560
planetary, and nations, wars will gradually become a thing of the past. So, I'm optimistic

26:08.560 --> 26:15.920
that once we hit type one, it'll usher in an age of Aquarius. But it's a big if, right? Yeah,

26:15.920 --> 26:21.760
it's not guaranteed. We have lots of self-inflicted problems. Some people say that we should not go

26:21.760 --> 26:27.520
to Mars because we'll mess up Mars just like we messed up the earth. Well, I think we should

26:27.520 --> 26:33.760
not go to Mars to escape global warming. We should cure global warming on the earth. We are

26:33.760 --> 26:39.440
earthlings. Our first priority is to spaceship earth, and that means we have to get our act

26:39.440 --> 26:45.200
together. We have to rain in nuclear weapons. We have to deal with global warming on the earth,

26:45.200 --> 26:50.560
not by fleeing to Mars. What are some of the most important crucial science and technology

26:50.560 --> 26:55.280
and innovation that we have to reach from now in order to reach type one civilization?

26:55.280 --> 27:01.760
Well, the big technology facing us right now is artificial intelligence, as I mentioned.

27:01.760 --> 27:07.040
In the future, I think the robotics industry will be bigger than the car industry,

27:07.040 --> 27:12.480
because your robot, your car, will become a robot. You'll talk to your car. You'll argue with your

27:12.480 --> 27:18.800
car. You'll ask your car for information, for help. You'll gossip with your car, and so your

27:18.800 --> 27:26.640
car will be part of the AI robotics industry. That's how big it's going to be. For example,

27:26.640 --> 27:32.080
when you want medical care, you'll talk to RoboDoc. RoboDoc is a software program in your wristwatch

27:32.720 --> 27:40.240
that analyzes your body to give you expert advice. RoboLawyer will help you when you're

27:40.240 --> 27:44.480
in a car accident, and you've got to talk to a lawyer if you're traveling in Europe and you

27:44.480 --> 27:50.080
don't speak the local language. We'll be surrounded by artificially intelligent technologies,

27:50.080 --> 27:54.880
and that's going to change the way we function. Further down the line, I think we're going to

27:54.880 --> 28:00.000
have BrainNet. I think we'll telepathically communicate with other people. In my book,

28:00.000 --> 28:04.880
The Future of the Mind, I actually go to the laboratories where we do this. We actually do

28:04.880 --> 28:10.880
this at Berkeley, where I got my PhD many years ago. We actually now can photograph dreams. We can

28:10.880 --> 28:17.280
now upload memories. Things that were once considered preposterous about the mind, we now do.

28:17.280 --> 28:22.560
Can we understand the purpose of dreaming just out of curiosity now? Oh, the purpose of dreaming. Well,

28:22.560 --> 28:28.960
actually, from my book, The Future of the Mind, I interviewed one of the leading experimenters on

28:28.960 --> 28:35.280
dreams, and I asked him, what is dreams and why do we dream? He said the following. He said, first

28:35.280 --> 28:41.600
of all, when you brain scan the brain when you dream, the center part of the brain is the brain

28:41.600 --> 28:48.080
of emotion, the monkey brain, the amygdala. That lights up, but the amygdala also generates nightmares,

28:48.080 --> 28:55.040
and that's one reason why many dreams are horrible because the amygdala lights up. The front part of

28:55.040 --> 29:02.320
your brain shuts off. Blood flow to the prefrontal cortex goes to near zero, and that's why your

29:02.320 --> 29:09.280
dreams are fantastic. Things that were obviously violating common sense exist freely when you dream

29:09.920 --> 29:16.240
because the front part of the brain is shut off. And then lucid dreaming, when you actually control

29:16.240 --> 29:23.840
the direction of your dream, has proven to be correct. In Germany, at the Max Planck Institute

29:23.840 --> 29:30.320
in Leipzig, Germany, they took a lucid dreamer, put him in a brain scan, and bingo, he was awake

29:30.320 --> 29:36.960
while dreaming, and he could control the direction of his dreams. In fact, you can learn how to do it

29:36.960 --> 29:44.080
too. There are Buddhist textbooks, centuries old, that teach you the method of how to become a lucid

29:44.080 --> 29:50.720
dreamer, which we now have verified experimentally in the laboratory. Also, we can begin to photograph

29:50.720 --> 29:57.440
that dream as well. At Berkeley, they put a subject in an MRI scan, have him visualize the Mona Lisa,

29:57.440 --> 30:04.480
for example. When you brain scan him, you analyze 30,000 pixels representing blood flow in different

30:04.480 --> 30:10.080
parts of the brain, put it in the computer, and bingo, a picture emerges of the Mona Lisa.

30:10.720 --> 30:17.600
Fantastic. All the technology and science that we have now and coming in the future, they depend

30:17.600 --> 30:23.760
on our computing power, correct? And from that perspective, we can say that our life and our

30:23.760 --> 30:28.960
future now depends on silicon. But what's coming after silicon? What is the next generation of

30:28.960 --> 30:36.560
computing? Is quantum computers a viable candidate? Yes. You realize that Silicon Valley could

30:36.560 --> 30:42.800
eventually become a rust belt. If you drive through Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania, you see all

30:42.800 --> 30:49.200
these closed factories because technology went ahead and the industry did not, and so we have a

30:49.200 --> 30:54.720
rust belt. Silicon Valley could become a rust belt because one day the transistors of silicon

30:54.720 --> 31:01.200
will become obsolete for two reasons, heat and leakage. So when transistors become so small

31:01.920 --> 31:07.680
that they're the size of molecules, then molecules leak and molecules create tremendous

31:07.680 --> 31:14.160
amounts of energy. The chip will melt as a consequence and short circuit because of leakage.

31:14.160 --> 31:20.960
So we physicists are desperately trying to find a way to maintain computer power because we're so

31:20.960 --> 31:27.120
used to Moore's law that computer power doubles every 18 months. But as George Harrison once said,

31:27.120 --> 31:34.160
all things must pass even the age of silicon. So one day Silicon Valley will go bankrupt perhaps,

31:34.720 --> 31:41.600
and technology will go someplace else where we have quantum computers and molecular computers

31:41.600 --> 31:47.040
that compute on molecules and compute on individual atoms. However, we're not there yet,

31:47.520 --> 31:54.320
and these technologies are not ready for prime time. What are your thoughts on education system?

31:54.320 --> 31:59.680
Are we doing a good job training the new generation to deal with all these overly complex

32:01.120 --> 32:06.080
new wave of change that is coming? And what do you see as a suitable education system for the age of

32:06.080 --> 32:12.000
AI and automation? First of all, we're all born scientists. We're born wondering why the sun

32:12.000 --> 32:18.560
shines. We're born wondering where we came from and why the stars twinkle. Then we encounter the

32:18.560 --> 32:27.520
greatest destroyer of scientists known to science. It destroys thousands of scientists. This destroyer

32:27.520 --> 32:36.080
of scientists is junior high school. Even as we speak, thousands of junior high school kids have

32:36.080 --> 32:41.920
been turned off to science because they're taking their first courses in science, and science is

32:41.920 --> 32:49.840
made boring. It's made into memorization. Learn the parts of a flower. I mean, memorize the moons

32:49.840 --> 32:56.080
of Jupiter. I mean, who cares? I'm a scientist. I never have to look up the parts of a flyer.

32:56.080 --> 33:00.720
You just go to the internet, and there it is. In fact, in the future, the internet is going to be

33:00.720 --> 33:06.640
inside your contact lens. You'll blink, and you'll be online, and there's the periodic chart. So why

33:06.640 --> 33:12.080
do you bother to memorize all the elements of the periodic chart? You have to use the chart,

33:12.080 --> 33:18.720
not memorize the chart. And so I think that we should revamp junior high school because

33:18.720 --> 33:25.200
that's where we lose millions, millions of scientists. It also has a lot to do with the

33:25.200 --> 33:32.480
society, right? Because every kind of technological innovation works as good as a society that adapts

33:32.480 --> 33:40.480
it. So when we're lacking in education, we're practically building a society that can be fooled

33:40.480 --> 33:45.680
by a lot of false information. And I just want to go back to democracy, that when they can't vote,

33:45.680 --> 33:51.120
and the voting power is equal, if somebody believes that they've been abducted by aliens,

33:51.120 --> 33:59.360
they can neutralize some scientist votes. Well, what we can do is change our curriculum,

33:59.360 --> 34:07.360
because our colleges and high schools do a good job of graduating students to live in 1950.

34:08.640 --> 34:14.240
The only problem is, we don't live in 1950 anymore. But the curriculum is so stale, so

34:14.240 --> 34:21.120
so backward, and yet that's what we teach our kids. For example, sometimes I teach physics for pre-meds.

34:21.760 --> 34:26.400
These are the people who are going to be operating on you using the most advanced MRI scans and PET

34:26.400 --> 34:32.800
scans and EKG scans, right? What do I teach them about MRI scans and PET scans and all,

34:32.800 --> 34:38.240
and radiomedicine and advanced cancer research? No, the book says I have to teach them about

34:38.240 --> 34:46.400
friction, tuning forks, levers, and pulleys. Now, they were important 300 years ago, but we moved on.

34:46.400 --> 34:53.200
We've moved on since 300 years ago. But there I am teaching them about things that were very

34:53.200 --> 34:59.200
interesting 300 years ago, but are not cutting edge anymore. But that's how we teach physics to

34:59.200 --> 35:03.360
medical students. Are you telling them that what you're teaching them is? Yeah, we teach them

35:03.360 --> 35:08.320
Newtonian knowledge, but we've gone way past Newton. We're into the age of Einstein. We're into

35:08.320 --> 35:13.440
the age of electricity and computers and high-tech, but we don't teach that stuff. And so when you go

35:13.440 --> 35:20.080
to a laboratory, I talk to the doctors there. They're clueless. They don't know how these things

35:20.080 --> 35:24.880
work. They just know that they work. And as a consequence, we've had horrible accidents.

35:24.880 --> 35:29.200
Cat scans, for example, hit you with a tremendous amount of radiation. It has to be done very

35:29.200 --> 35:33.440
carefully by technicians. However, these technicians don't know up from down with the

35:33.440 --> 35:37.920
radiation coming from the cat scan. And there are all these pictures of patients that have lost

35:37.920 --> 35:44.000
their hair because of the enormous quantities of X-rays that hit their scalp. I mean, we find

35:44.000 --> 35:50.800
these pictures in Hiroshima, but there we have hospitals where the patients look like victims

35:50.800 --> 35:57.040
from Hiroshima because the technicians don't know how to calibrate cat scans. Wow.

35:57.040 --> 36:02.560
There's a question from one of our listeners. How do you see the rise in the future of the private

36:02.560 --> 36:06.960
sector involvement in the space industry? SpaceX would be a very good example of that.

36:07.600 --> 36:18.000
Well, just realize that in 1966, the Apollo space program consumed 5% of the entire federal budget.

36:18.000 --> 36:23.920
Now that's unsustainable. 5% of every tax dollar you pay in your income tax went to the space

36:23.920 --> 36:31.520
program. So now prices are dropping like a rock. When you saw the movie The Martian with Matt Damon,

36:32.080 --> 36:39.600
that movie cost $100 million. But the Indian sent a space probe to Mars for $70 million.

36:40.320 --> 36:46.880
So you realize the Hollywood movies about going to Mars cost more than actually going to Mars.

36:47.760 --> 36:52.400
So the Chinese, the Indians, they've all said that, yeah, they're going to put their flags in the

36:52.400 --> 36:58.480
moon. So there's going to be a race. And are we up for it? Well, last month, millions of people

36:58.480 --> 37:04.640
tuned in to watch the launching of the Falcon Heavy from Cape Canaveral. Why? It's just an

37:04.640 --> 37:10.080
ordinary rocket for God's sake. We see them take off all the time, right? No, the Falcon Heavy was

37:10.080 --> 37:18.560
a moon rocket, fully capable of sending astronauts to the moon. Now, this rocket was paid for, not by

37:18.560 --> 37:26.240
taxpayers, but by a private individual, Elon Musk of Tesla Motors. This is incredible. Think about

37:26.240 --> 37:33.200
that. A private individual opening up his checkbook and bankrolling a moon rocket, which could take

37:33.200 --> 37:40.400
our astronauts to the moon. That's how much prices have dropped. And that's how much space has opened

37:40.400 --> 37:46.400
up for the government and for private enterprise. And I think we're entering a new golden age.

37:46.400 --> 37:52.960
A new golden age of space research, because prices have dropped. In fact, it takes three days to go

37:52.960 --> 37:59.040
to the moon, one week for a round trip to the moon. I think in the future, our grandkids may

37:59.040 --> 38:05.120
honeymoon on the moon. That's how close the moon is. Well, honeymoon on the moon. Mars, of course,

38:05.120 --> 38:12.000
is farther away, but the moon will be for tourists in the future. I actually drove up to Kennedy

38:12.000 --> 38:17.920
Center for the launch of Falcon Heavy, and that was the first launch that I was seeing, and it

38:17.920 --> 38:22.880
was the most incredible experience of my life. Those two Falcons coming back down and just

38:22.880 --> 38:29.200
watching science fiction. And something that was very encouraging was how engaged and how excited

38:29.200 --> 38:34.080
people of different age groups are, and there were thousands of people there. Yes. So we're entering,

38:34.080 --> 38:41.920
I think, a new era in space exploration, that the old days when space was considered very, very

38:41.920 --> 38:46.400
expensive, and only Russia and the United States could do it, those days are gone. We're talking

38:46.400 --> 38:50.800
about private entrepreneurs. You realize the richest man in the world, Jeff Bezos of Amazon,

38:51.440 --> 38:56.560
he has created his own spaceport in Texas. He doesn't even bother to go to Cape Canaveral.

38:56.560 --> 39:02.720
He shoots his rockets from his own spaceport. And Google, Google has created a space port

39:02.720 --> 39:07.600
and Google, Google billionaires not to be left behind, they're jumping into the game. They want

39:07.600 --> 39:13.360
to mine the asteroid belt. It's a whole new ball game out there. And that's why one of the reasons

39:13.360 --> 39:19.600
why I wrote the book, to teach people that, hey, we're entering a new golden age of space

39:19.600 --> 39:25.840
exploration. Prices have dropped. Countries like India and China are jumping in the game.

39:26.480 --> 39:31.280
Silicon Valley billionaires are underwriting the cost of it. I mean, we're going to go to the stars.

39:31.280 --> 39:35.840
Do you see governments on the way of progress at this point? I mean,

39:36.480 --> 39:40.480
what we're talking about now and what's happening with SpaceX and all the great

39:40.480 --> 39:45.680
things with technology and science. Meanwhile, we watch in Congress and Senate what they're

39:45.680 --> 39:51.200
talking about, you know, businessmen and lawyers. Yeah, well, I think there's going to be a mix.

39:52.320 --> 39:57.760
Private enterprise has a definite role to play because taxpayers don't have to foot the bill.

39:57.760 --> 40:05.360
And they in turn want to have a return by mining operations when they go to the moon and Mars.

40:05.360 --> 40:13.920
And I think a union between government financing and private enterprise is what's new with this

40:13.920 --> 40:18.720
new space race. We're basically going to be competing against ourselves and we're going

40:18.720 --> 40:24.880
to be doing it safely and cheaply, which was not the way it was during the Cold War.

40:24.880 --> 40:30.880
I'm really curious to know your interpretation of two quotes. One is by Albert Einstein and the

40:30.880 --> 40:36.800
other is by Nikola Tesla. Einstein said, nature shows us only the tail of the lion, but there is

40:36.800 --> 40:42.800
no doubt in my mind that the lion belongs with it, even if he cannot reveal himself to the eye all

40:42.800 --> 40:49.040
at once because of his huge dimension. And then Tesla said, my brain is only a receiver. In the

40:49.040 --> 40:54.720
universe, there is a core from which we obtain knowledge, strength and inspiration. I have not

40:54.720 --> 40:59.760
penetrated into the secret of this core, but I know it exists. Are these quotes talking about

40:59.760 --> 41:04.880
the same thing? In your opinion? In other words, is the core that Tesla talks about the same as

41:04.880 --> 41:11.280
Einstein's lion dimension? Well, I think there's similarities. I think geniuses somewhat think the

41:11.280 --> 41:16.800
same way. They're talking about the theory of everything. When Einstein looked at the claw,

41:16.800 --> 41:22.800
he was talking about gravity. But he said that gravity must be connected to a much greater thing

41:22.800 --> 41:28.560
because look at light. Light is different from gravity. The other paw is light. So why should

41:28.560 --> 41:34.080
this lion have two paws? There must be a head, there must be a tail and other legs. And that,

41:34.080 --> 41:40.400
he thought, was the unified field theory. And Tesla too was tinkering with this idea that there's

41:40.400 --> 41:47.120
something out there. He thought maybe it was a vacuum that contained the secrets of our existence.

41:47.120 --> 41:52.560
And now we realize that, well, yes, the vacuum does have energy. It's called dark energy. And

41:52.560 --> 41:59.040
that's the energy of the Big Bang. That's what's causing the expanding universe. And so if you

41:59.040 --> 42:05.360
understand this energy of nothing, the energy of the vacuum, then in some sense, you can understand

42:05.360 --> 42:11.200
the deepest secrets of the universe. That is the unified field theory, which is what I do for a

42:11.200 --> 42:17.840
living. Would that be considered the end of physics? No, just because you are watching a chess

42:17.840 --> 42:24.400
game, and you slowly figured out how the pawns move and how the bishops move. That doesn't mean

42:24.400 --> 42:28.960
you're a grand master. That doesn't mean you're a master of chess. No, it just means you know how

42:28.960 --> 42:34.480
the pawns move and how the bishops move. And so I think even if we do have the theory of everything,

42:34.480 --> 42:40.000
that's just the beginning. Because look, think of all the questions we can answer with the theory of

42:40.000 --> 42:46.400
everything. Is time travel possible? Einstein's equations say yes, but is it really practical?

42:46.400 --> 42:51.440
String theory will answer that question. Wormholes. Can we have gateways of the universes?

42:51.440 --> 42:57.840
What happened before the Big Bang? Is there a multiverse of universes? All these questions

42:57.840 --> 43:05.120
are way beyond Einstein's theory, but that's exactly what string theory can do. String theory

43:05.120 --> 43:10.400
in principle can answer these questions about parallel universes, time travel, wormholes,

43:10.400 --> 43:14.960
the multiverse. So once we have the unified field theory, that's just the beginning.

43:16.320 --> 43:20.960
I just want to know very quickly your thoughts on the simulation theory as well.

43:21.520 --> 43:26.800
Sure. What are your thoughts on simulation theory? Well, many people saw the movie The Matrix,

43:26.800 --> 43:34.480
and they thought to themselves, wow, can reality be uploaded into our minds? Is the universe nothing

43:34.480 --> 43:40.160
but a simulation? In other words, did God put a CD into a CD player and hit the play button?

43:40.880 --> 43:47.280
Once you hit the play button, here we are acting as if we have free will, acting as if we know

43:47.280 --> 43:52.640
what we're doing, but we're just puppets. We're just puppets dancing on the computer screen

43:52.640 --> 43:58.960
just because somebody hit the play button. Is that reality? I don't think so for the following

43:58.960 --> 44:06.000
reason. If we were to have a computer to simulate the weather, the computer would have to be

44:07.040 --> 44:13.680
enormous in size just because there's so many molecules inside the weather. In fact, the

44:13.680 --> 44:22.400
smallest object that can simulate the weather is the weather itself. So the smallest object that

44:22.400 --> 44:28.320
can model the universe is the universe itself. Now that's using Newton's equations, assuming that

44:28.320 --> 44:35.360
atoms are hard steel balls. Quantum mechanics says no. Quantum mechanics says that these balls can

44:35.360 --> 44:40.960
be everywhere at the same time, which of course violates common sense, but who cares about your

44:40.960 --> 44:48.080
common sense? So we're in a situation now where quantum mechanics makes many more possible

44:48.080 --> 44:54.320
universes than Newton's equations. So if Newton's equations cannot be simulated except by Newton's

44:54.320 --> 45:00.080
equations themselves, then what chance do we have of doing this with quantum mechanics? So that's

45:00.080 --> 45:06.160
why I do not think we are a simulation. We have free will and we're not marionettes dancing just

45:06.160 --> 45:11.840
because somebody hit the play button. Well, Dr. Kakou, this has been a pleasure and an honor to

45:11.840 --> 45:16.480
speak with you. Allow me to ask you the last question that I ask all my guests, that if you

45:16.480 --> 45:22.560
come across an intelligent alien from a different civilization, what would you say as the worst thing

45:22.560 --> 45:28.880
humanity has done and what would you say as our greatest achievement? Well, I would say our worst

45:28.880 --> 45:35.360
achievement is our ability to self-destruct. We have all these self-inflicted problems like global

45:35.360 --> 45:41.680
warming, nuclear proliferation, and germ warfare that could end this great experiment called

45:41.680 --> 45:50.800
humanity. But on the positive side, I side with the words of General Eisenhower who once said that

45:50.800 --> 45:58.240
pessimists never win wars. Only optimists win wars. Only optimists change history. And because

45:58.240 --> 46:05.280
we are sentient, because we have self-consciousness, we are masters of our fate. And I think one

46:05.280 --> 46:13.440
possible destiny for us is to become a star-faring species, that is to reach for the stars.

46:35.280 --> 46:45.440
Thank you.
