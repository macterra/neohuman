1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
because we are sentient, because we have self-consciousness, we are masters of our

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:13,760
fate. And I think one possible destiny for us is to become a star-faring species, that is,

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:27,440
to reach for the stars. Hello and welcome to the 43rd episode of Neohuman Podcast. I'm a

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:33,200
Gabbahari etygologist on Twitter and Instagram, and you can follow the show on liveinlimbo.com,

5
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:41,640
iTunes, and YouTube. My guest this week is Dr. Michio Kaku. Welcome to the show, Dr. Kaku. Okay,

6
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,440
well glad to be on. Thank you. Why don't we start with your background, the work you've done, and

7
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,640
what are you focused on now these days? Currently, I work on something called string theory. I'm the

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,800
co-founder of string field theory, which is one of the main formulations of the theory. And we want

9
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:03,760
to get the theory down to a one-inch equation that will allow us to fulfill Einstein's dream of,

10
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,560
quote, reading the mind of God. Now, string theory in its present-day form, there are five

11
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,880
different string theories, and each one can be summarized by string field theory. In fact,

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,840
that equation is my equation. However, my equation is about an inch and a half long. We want to get

13
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:28,440
it down even further and allow membranes to coexist. This is called M theory, and that's even a more

14
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:34,000
advanced version of string theory. So right now, some of the brightest minds on earth are working

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,360
on M theory to try to find the ultimate formulation of the theory of everything. And how is the work

16
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:48,080
progressing? Well, pretty good. We have a pretty good handle on string theory in ten dimensions. Ten

17
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,880
dimensions is the dimension I usually work in. However, we now know from the work of people at

18
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,440
Princeton that there is an eleven-dimensional model out there, and we want to find the reformulation

19
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,320
of string theory in terms of eleven dimensions. That's really hard, because eleven dimensions,

20
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,840
they are membranes, and membranes are much more difficult to work with than strings. And so,

21
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,680
like I said, some of the brightest minds on earth now are trying to understand M theory. M for

22
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,040
mystery, magic, or membranes. You have a new book. I want to talk extensively about that. But before

23
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,920
that, I'm just wondering, I read a couple of years ago that physics is turning into a philosophy,

24
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,360
because there are a lot of theories that are very difficult or close to impossible to prove. What

25
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,840
do you think about that? Well, that's a valid criticism, because physics should be based on

26
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,240
things that are testable, reproducible, and falsifiable. However, now we're after bigger

27
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,200
game. We're after the theory of everything, the theory of the entire universe. Each solution of

28
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:56,680
string theory is an entire universe. A direct proof of that would require creating a baby universe in

29
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:02,280
the laboratory. In other words, to become God. Now, we can't do that, of course, but look at how

30
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:08,400
science is done. Science is done indirectly. Now, we know, for example, that the Sun is made out of

31
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:15,280
hydrogen. How do we know that? How do we know that the Sun is made out of hydrogen? No one's been to

32
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,760
the Sun. We've never sent a space probe to the Sun. So how do we know? Because we analyze echoes,

33
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,640
echoes from the Sun called sunlight. And by analyzing sunlight, we know the Sun is made out

34
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,000
of hydrogen. In the same way, we will prove the correctness of string theory and M theory by

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,960
looking at echoes from the 11th dimension. Amazing. Your new book is called The Future of

36
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:44,880
Humanity, Terraforming Mars, Interstellar Travel Immortality and Our Destiny Beyond Earth. How

37
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,920
many books have you written before this? Because you've been writing for many years. Well, yeah,

38
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,800
I've written about 15 books. Four of them are New York Times bestsellers. In fact, the book The

39
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:01,200
Future of Humanity just hit the New York Times bestseller list just a few days ago. Fantastic.

40
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,440
Congratulations. Well, thank you. Many of the other books I've written, however, offer PhD

41
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:13,240
physics students. So if you are a third or fourth year grad student in physics, then you can take

42
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:19,160
some of my textbooks, which are for PhD students. However, that requires five years of calculus and

43
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:27,000
six years of ordinary physics until you become a third year grad student. So what made you interested

44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,320
to write about the future of humanity at this point? Well, it all started when I was eight

45
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,720
years old. Everything started when I was eight. They announced that a great scientist had just

46
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:44,560
died and they flashed a picture of his desk with the unfinished manuscript of his greatest work.

47
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,680
Now, I was fascinated by that story. I didn't know who this man was. I just knew that he couldn't

48
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,800
finish something. So I said to myself, well, gee, what's the homework problem, right? Couldn't he

49
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,040
ask his mother? I mean, what's so hard that you can't finish it? So I said to myself, I want to

50
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:08,240
learn about this man. I want to learn about what he couldn't finish. Then I found out the man's

51
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,840
name was Albert Einstein. And he was working on the unified field theory, the theory of everything.

52
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,640
And then I went to the library to find out more about the unified field theory. And I found

53
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:29,640
nothing, absolutely nothing, not one book, not one reference to explain to me the unified field

54
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:35,400
theory. So I said to myself, when I grow up, and I become a professor of theoretical physics, I want

55
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:44,320
to at least at least write books for myself, for the kid that I used to be, so that I would be able

56
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,240
to access the unified field theory. And so I said to myself, well, if no one else is going to write

57
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,600
those books, I'll write them. And that's what I do. I mean, I've written some of the the earliest

58
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,360
books on string theory. But how can you predict what's coming in the future? I'm just wondering.

59
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:06,880
Well, I'm a physicist. And I know that you cannot absolutely predict the future. All you can do is

60
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:16,800
predict trends based on what you know, physics. Now, in 1900, there was a contest basically, to

61
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,520
predict the next 100 years. And these predictions were hilarious. Some people predicted that we

62
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:28,880
would have blimps, fleets of blimps to go across the Atlantic Ocean. Now, why were these predictions

63
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:35,720
of 1900 so wrong? They didn't know that they were four fundamental laws, forces of the universe.

64
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:41,260
Today, we know that today we know that there are four fundamental forces like gravity,

65
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:47,480
electromagnetism, which makes light bulbs possible and computers. And then we have the two nuclear

66
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,720
forces, the weak and the strong nuclear force, which lights up the sun, for example, we didn't

67
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:59,080
know that in 1900. And that's why some of the predictions are crazy. Today, we do know the four

68
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,800
fundamental laws. And so the predictions we make, yeah, we're going to make bloopers, we're going to

69
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:11,280
still make mistakes, but they will be based on sound fundamental physics. That's the difference

70
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:19,600
between predictions now and predictions in 1900. So to predict the future of humanity, first we

71
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:26,200
need to define what humanity is today. How would you define what is a human today and how this

72
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:31,680
definition is going to evolve in the future? Well, we think that humans are homo sapiens,

73
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:39,280
but we're different from the other creatures on the planet earth. 99.9% of all species on the earth

74
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,720
have gone extinct. If you don't believe me, dig underneath your feet, right underneath your feet,

75
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:54,320
and you'll meet the bones of the 99.9% of species that never made it. Extinction is the norm for

76
00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:01,320
all life forms on the planet earth. Now, we're different. We have a big brain. We can perhaps

77
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:07,400
change our destiny. So our species is unique among all the other species, because after all,

78
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:13,840
the dinosaurs did not have a space program. And because the dinosaurs did not have a space

79
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,160
program, they're not here today to talk about it. They got wiped out when that meteor or comet hit

80
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:26,840
Mexico 65 million years ago. But we do have a big brain. We do have rocket ships. We do have a space

81
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:34,120
program. And so we're in a position to defeat the odds of nature. That nature says all life forms

82
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:41,640
must eventually die, except maybe us, homo sapiens. And how do you see the role of technology in who

83
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:49,480
we are today? Well, we have to ask ourselves, where did civilization, wealth and prosperity

84
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:56,360
come from? You know, 300 years ago, the average person lived to be about 35 or 40. They didn't

85
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,720
live very long. It was a hard life. You had kids and then you died. Life was a bitch back then.

86
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:08,280
What happened? What happened was 200 years ago, we physicists worked out the laws of thermodynamics.

87
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:14,640
That made possible the steam engine. And the steam engine made possible the locomotive, factories,

88
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,520
and the Industrial Revolution. And then 80 years after that, we physicists worked out

89
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:26,640
electromagnetism, which made possible the electric age. All of a sudden, we had dynamos and generators

90
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,640
and light bulbs and television. 80 years after that, we physicists invented the computer,

91
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:40,080
the transistor and the laser beam. And with the transistor, we ushered in the high tech age.

92
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:47,040
And now we are undergoing the fourth wave of wealth generation. And that is artificial

93
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:53,600
intelligence, biotech and nanotech. And once again, physics is helping to lead the way

94
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,360
into the future. How do you feel about AI, artificial intelligence?

95
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:05,440
Well, there's a debate between Elon Musk of SpaceX and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook.

96
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:12,480
Mark Zuckerberg says that robots are going to open up new pathways for prosperity, jobs,

97
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:20,080
industry, and it'll be beneficial for society. Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla Motors says,

98
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:26,800
not so fast, not so fast. What happens when the robots take over? That could be a huge mistake

99
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,160
on the part of humanity. So I was on CNN on the Quest show, and I was asked that question,

100
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:40,880
who's right? My position is both are right to a degree. Zuckerberg is right that for the

101
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:47,440
next several decades, there are billionaires waiting to be minted. There are industries

102
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:54,160
waiting to be revolutionized. Jobs, industry, economic activity will come with artificial

103
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,320
intelligence. But let's not be naive. There's a certain point at which robots become

104
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,480
dangerous. That point is when they become self-aware. Now, robots do not know their robots.

105
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,760
If you compare them to an animal, they would barely compare to a cockroach.

106
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,280
Cockroaches can just barely walk across the room. That's the level of intelligence of most of our

107
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:27,520
robots. However, in the coming decades, robots will become as smart as a mouse, then a rat,

108
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:36,560
then a rabbit, then a cat, then a dog, and finally a monkey. Now, monkeys are self-aware.

109
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:46,080
They know they are not humans. Now, dogs are confused. Dogs think that, well, humans are dogs

110
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:52,400
too. We're the top dog, and they're the underdog, and that's why they obey us, because they think

111
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:58,800
we're the top dog. Now, monkeys aren't that stupid. Monkeys know they are not human. But so when

112
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,200
robots become as smart as a monkey, I think we should put a chip in their brain to shut them off

113
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,760
if they have murderous thoughts. How would that work out with ethics and morality though,

114
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,640
because if something is self-conscious, within that thing, whatever that may be,

115
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:19,440
has the right to express itself? Well, yes and no. But at the present time, robots do not have

116
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:26,080
rights. I think robots will eventually have rights, and that point is when robots suffer pain.

117
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,560
You see, pain is very important for us to exist. People who are born without pain sensors usually

118
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:38,800
have their fingers and toes amputated, because you take all sorts of risks and do dangerous things

119
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,320
and not know it, because you have no pain sensors. So eventually, robots are going to have to have

120
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,800
pain sensors. They're going to have to feel pain. Otherwise, they're going to try to do feats of

121
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,920
superhuman ability and destroy themselves. And so robots will eventually be equipped with pain

122
00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:00,480
sensors. At that point, I think we should think about the ethics of robots, because you don't want

123
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:07,760
to make robots suffer unnecessarily. Because if you are a human, yes, there are sadists among us

124
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,400
who will want to torture animals and who will want to torture robots once they can feel pain.

125
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:20,960
So I think eventually, we're going to have to look at the rights, the robotic rights of robots. But

126
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:26,400
that's still many decades into the future. But eventually, I think we will have to have robot

127
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:32,720
ethics. One of the arguments in favor of controlling artificial intelligence advancement is that to

128
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,920
make it more human, or in a way put our ethics and morality within the machine. And I've always

129
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,760
wondered, do we really know where our ethics and morality come from? Are ethics and morality

130
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,120
objective or subjective and interpreted depending on the individual ability to process information?

131
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:56,960
Well, I think Galileo said it the best several hundred years ago. He was asked about ethics,

132
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:04,560
religion, science and all that. And he said the purpose of science is to determine how the heavens

133
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:14,000
go. The purpose of religion is to determine how to go to heaven. So in other words, science is about

134
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:23,120
natural law. It's about discovering the laws of nature. Religion is about ethics, about how to go

135
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,800
to heaven, how to be a good person, the golden rule, how to be nice, how to treat other people

136
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:35,120
nice. And so if you want to know what ethics is, it's relative to the tribe. Whatever holds the

137
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,680
tribe together is considered good. Okay. And so that's why ethics changes from tribe to tribe,

138
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:48,080
because it's relative to the glue that holds the tribe together. So I think evolutionarily speaking,

139
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,920
that religion was good for us, because back in the caveman days, if you were becoming intelligent,

140
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,440
you bad mouthed the leader, you hijacked the leader, you killed the leader to take over the

141
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,320
tribe because you were smarter than him. So I think tribes of our ancestors fell apart.

142
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,600
Intelligence is quite corrosive and quite divisive. You bring five people together,

143
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:18,240
you get six points of view. And so I think tribes that were based on intelligence fell apart and

144
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,080
died. They're not here today. They left their genes in the gene pool. The genes that survived

145
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:31,920
were the genes of people that had religion, a glue of ethics that held the tribe together.

146
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,520
We are descended from them. That's why if you are a Martian landing on the planet earth,

147
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:43,200
you'll realize that every society on the planet earth has a religion, because religion is a glue,

148
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:49,520
is ethics. It's about how to become a good person, how to go to heaven, how to hold the tribe

149
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:55,600
together. How do you see the role of religion today? Well, in our early days, I think religion

150
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,360
had an extremely positive aspect to it, because it kept us together, because there was no science

151
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,520
back in those days. I think there's a gene for religion, a God gene. I think there is a God

152
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:15,120
gene. There's no science gene. There's no let's pick this apart gene. No, the genes for jumping

153
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,320
to conclusion, for making outrageous conclusions, for guessing. Yeah, there's probably a gene for

154
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:28,240
that. But there's no gene for science. Science is an acquired taste. You have to learn about science

155
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:35,600
the hard way by making all sorts of mistakes. And so I think in the early days, we needed religion.

156
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,840
Religion and science were dialectical. You could not have intelligent apes without religion keeping

157
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:48,240
the tribe together. But after a while, when we discover industry, we discover the four or five

158
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:55,840
industry, we discover the four fundamental laws, we discover hydrogen warheads, then science has to

159
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:02,160
deal with ethical questions for the first time. It's no longer just creating a science experiment.

160
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:10,240
No, it's destroying the human race. That's the power of science. And so religion is bad if it

161
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:17,600
fosters divisiveness, sectarianism, fundamentalism. But it could be good if it fosters humanitarianism.

162
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:25,120
And fosters knowledge and growth and democracy. So I think that in the old days, yeah, religion was

163
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:32,560
good for us, even if it was outrageously mystical and outrageously irrational. Today, it's a double

164
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:38,160
edged sword. It could hold the tribe together, or it could also destroy the tribe. Can it also be

165
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,840
considered an obstacle on the way of science? Let's consider, for example, immortality,

166
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:50,000
which is a very big deal if you reach it. And I know you talk about it in a book. But from a

167
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,240
Christian point of view, or any other monotheistic religion point of view, you you're born and then

168
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,600
you die and then you get rewarded or punished. So how would this work, especially in a democracy

169
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:09,280
where anybody's vote is equal to the other person? Well, in a democracy, people get to choose their

170
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,400
destiny, right? Not a king, not a queen, not a dictator, but people begin to choose their own

171
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:21,520
destiny. And I think that immortality, or at least partial immortality, is definitely in the cards

172
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:28,480
in two ways. First is digital immortality. And the second is genetic or biologic immortality. So

173
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,520
let's break them down. Digital immortality is when you digitize everything known about your digital

174
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:40,480
fingerprints. Already in Silicon Valley, there are companies offering, for a price, digital,

175
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,800
a form of digital immortality. Everything known about you, your credit card transactions,

176
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:53,600
your Instagram photographs, your emails, everything in your digital fingerprint can be compiled.

177
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,800
So then in the future, when you go to the library, instead of getting a book about Winston Churchill,

178
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:05,120
you'll talk to Winston Churchill. All his mannerisms, all his memories, all his speeches

179
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:11,200
will be recorded and digitized. I would love to talk to Einstein. I would love an opportunity

180
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,440
to talk to a digitized Einstein that digitized all his works, all his theories, all his speeches,

181
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,760
all his videos, all of it digitized. In fact, I think that you will be able to talk to your

182
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:30,000
great, great, great, great, great, great grandkids because their ancestors have been digitized. Now,

183
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,280
once we digitize you, you are in some sense immortal. And what do we do with it? I think

184
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,560
we should put it on a laser beam and shoot it into outer space. In one second, your consciousness

185
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:50,160
will be on the moon. In 15 minutes, your consciousness will be on Mars. In four years,

186
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:56,560
you'll be on Alpha Centauri, the nearest star. Now, let me stick my neck out. I think this already

187
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:02,240
exists. I call this laser porting. It's much more efficient than flying saucers. And I think this

188
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,360
already exists. I think aliens in outer space probably laser port their consciousness across

189
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,640
the galaxy at the speed of light. They don't bother with rockets, with weightlessness,

190
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,880
with rocket accidents and cosmic rays and accidents. They don't bother with that. They

191
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,560
simply digitize themselves and shoot their consciousness across the galaxy.

192
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,560
It's really interesting to me that when we're talking about certain things like becoming a

193
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:35,120
multi-planetary species, you're a theoretical physicist, you talk about it, and then you see

194
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,560
someone like Stanley Kubrick also make a movie about it, Space Odyssey, which is basically about

195
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:45,680
becoming a multi-planetary species, correct? Yeah. In fact, in the first 10 minutes of the movie,

196
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,080
he actually had talking heads. He had physicists, some of them acquaintances of mine,

197
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,840
who were interviewed about extraterrestrial civilizations. But then at the last minute,

198
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,200
at the last minute, Kubrick cut the first 10 minutes of his own film. And so the film became

199
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:08,160
somewhat mystical. However, today it is still perhaps the most logically consistent encounter

200
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,520
with an extraterrestrial civilization. More than likely, an extraterrestrial civilization will

201
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,600
explore the galaxy with robots, self-replicating von Neumann probes that land on the moon,

202
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,560
like the monolith in the movie. On the moon, they create copies of themselves and they shoot out

203
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:32,720
to land on other moons and make copies of themselves again from the lunar soil. And that way,

204
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:40,000
from one monolith, you can get two, then 10, then 1,000, dot, dot, dot, an exponential growth of

205
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,680
these things. And you can therefore analyze the entire galaxy in 100,000 years. So on our moon,

206
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:53,520
I wouldn't be a bit surprised if on our moon there is evidence of an ancient visitation

207
00:21:53,520 --> 00:22:02,160
because the moon has no rust, no erosion, no water to speak of. It's the ideal place to put a probe,

208
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:09,280
a von Neumann probe, that simply monitors our solar system. So I think that movie, 2001,

209
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:15,040
is perhaps the most realistic encounter with extraterrestrial intelligence. Now, to be fair,

210
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:20,080
I get emails from people who say nonsense. I've been abducted, they say, by aliens from outer

211
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:26,560
space. I've been on their flying saucers, so I know what aliens are like. My advice to you is,

212
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:32,880
if you've been abducted by aliens from outer space, my advice to you is, steal something.

213
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:39,840
An alien paperweight, a chip, a scissors, anything. Steal something, because there's no law against

214
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,800
stealing from an extraterrestrial civilization. No law to prevent you. You're not going to go to

215
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,920
jail stealing from an alien. And you'll have bragging rights afterwards. And you'll have

216
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:55,920
something that is testable, falsifiable, and reproducible. That's the hallmark of true science.

217
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,520
There seems to be a similarity between those who think they've been abducted by aliens and those

218
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,800
who think they spoke to God to become a Chosen One. It always happens when no one else is around.

219
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:13,360
Yeah. And look, I don't dispute the fact that these people believe that. You put them in a

220
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:19,280
lie detector test, they'll probably come out smelling like a rose. My only thing is that science

221
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:25,440
is based on things that are testable, falsifiable, and reproducible. And things like proving the

222
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:32,720
existence of God is outside of our testability. Therefore, these questions like miracles, angels,

223
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:38,320
gods, and things like that, maybe they exist, maybe they don't. But science says nothing about

224
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:44,080
them, because they're not testable, falsifiable, and reproducible. Is there any big picture objective

225
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:50,560
or rather philosophy for science and technology? Could perhaps becoming a type one civilization on

226
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:56,720
the Kardashev scale be considered the objective? Yeah, we are about 100 years from becoming type

227
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:03,040
one. A type one civilization is planetary. They control the weather, for example. They control

228
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:09,440
planetary energy, like Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers, about 100 years in the future. Then we have type

229
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:16,800
two, which is stellar. They control the output of entire stars. They play with stars, like Star

230
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:22,560
Trek. Star Trek would be a typical type two civilization. Then there's type three, which is

231
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:28,160
galactic, which means they control black holes. They control the black hole at the center of the

232
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:35,120
galaxy. They roam the galactic space lanes. Now, what are we on this cosmic scale? Are we controlling

233
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:42,080
the weather? Are we playing with the sun? Do we roam the galactic space lanes? No, we're type zero.

234
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,680
We get energy from dead plants, but we are about 100 years from becoming type one. For example,

235
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:54,480
what is the internet? The internet is the first type one technology to land in the 21st century,

236
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,960
so we're privileged to be alive to see the birth of the first type one technology. What language

237
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,560
will they speak? Well, already on the earth, the two most popular languages on the internet are

238
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:14,240
English and Mandarin Chinese. What music will they listen to? Well, we already have a planetary

239
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,560
youth music called rock and roll. We already have the Olympics, the planetary sports. We already have

240
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,720
the beginning of planetary fashion with Chanel and Gucci. We're seeing the birth of a planetary

241
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:33,280
culture and a planetary energy source right before our eyes, but this transition is the most

242
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:38,640
dangerous of all. As Elon Musk has said, maybe they're out there, but maybe they blew themselves

243
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:48,160
apart. So, we are still mired in the swamp. We have all the savagery of our rise from the swamp.

244
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:53,760
We have sectarianism, fundamentalism, anti-scientism. We have all these horrible

245
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:01,520
isms facing us, but once we hit type one, then we become planetary, and then we become

246
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:08,560
planetary, and nations, wars will gradually become a thing of the past. So, I'm optimistic

247
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:15,920
that once we hit type one, it'll usher in an age of Aquarius. But it's a big if, right? Yeah,

248
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:21,760
it's not guaranteed. We have lots of self-inflicted problems. Some people say that we should not go

249
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:27,520
to Mars because we'll mess up Mars just like we messed up the earth. Well, I think we should

250
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:33,760
not go to Mars to escape global warming. We should cure global warming on the earth. We are

251
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:39,440
earthlings. Our first priority is to spaceship earth, and that means we have to get our act

252
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,200
together. We have to rain in nuclear weapons. We have to deal with global warming on the earth,

253
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,560
not by fleeing to Mars. What are some of the most important crucial science and technology

254
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:55,280
and innovation that we have to reach from now in order to reach type one civilization?

255
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:01,760
Well, the big technology facing us right now is artificial intelligence, as I mentioned.

256
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,040
In the future, I think the robotics industry will be bigger than the car industry,

257
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:12,480
because your robot, your car, will become a robot. You'll talk to your car. You'll argue with your

258
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,800
car. You'll ask your car for information, for help. You'll gossip with your car, and so your

259
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:26,640
car will be part of the AI robotics industry. That's how big it's going to be. For example,

260
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:32,080
when you want medical care, you'll talk to RoboDoc. RoboDoc is a software program in your wristwatch

261
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:40,240
that analyzes your body to give you expert advice. RoboLawyer will help you when you're

262
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,480
in a car accident, and you've got to talk to a lawyer if you're traveling in Europe and you

263
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:50,080
don't speak the local language. We'll be surrounded by artificially intelligent technologies,

264
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,880
and that's going to change the way we function. Further down the line, I think we're going to

265
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:00,000
have BrainNet. I think we'll telepathically communicate with other people. In my book,

266
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,880
The Future of the Mind, I actually go to the laboratories where we do this. We actually do

267
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,880
this at Berkeley, where I got my PhD many years ago. We actually now can photograph dreams. We can

268
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:17,280
now upload memories. Things that were once considered preposterous about the mind, we now do.

269
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:22,560
Can we understand the purpose of dreaming just out of curiosity now? Oh, the purpose of dreaming. Well,

270
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:28,960
actually, from my book, The Future of the Mind, I interviewed one of the leading experimenters on

271
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:35,280
dreams, and I asked him, what is dreams and why do we dream? He said the following. He said, first

272
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:41,600
of all, when you brain scan the brain when you dream, the center part of the brain is the brain

273
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:48,080
of emotion, the monkey brain, the amygdala. That lights up, but the amygdala also generates nightmares,

274
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:55,040
and that's one reason why many dreams are horrible because the amygdala lights up. The front part of

275
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:02,320
your brain shuts off. Blood flow to the prefrontal cortex goes to near zero, and that's why your

276
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:09,280
dreams are fantastic. Things that were obviously violating common sense exist freely when you dream

277
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:16,240
because the front part of the brain is shut off. And then lucid dreaming, when you actually control

278
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:23,840
the direction of your dream, has proven to be correct. In Germany, at the Max Planck Institute

279
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:30,320
in Leipzig, Germany, they took a lucid dreamer, put him in a brain scan, and bingo, he was awake

280
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:36,960
while dreaming, and he could control the direction of his dreams. In fact, you can learn how to do it

281
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:44,080
too. There are Buddhist textbooks, centuries old, that teach you the method of how to become a lucid

282
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:50,720
dreamer, which we now have verified experimentally in the laboratory. Also, we can begin to photograph

283
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:57,440
that dream as well. At Berkeley, they put a subject in an MRI scan, have him visualize the Mona Lisa,

284
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:04,480
for example. When you brain scan him, you analyze 30,000 pixels representing blood flow in different

285
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,080
parts of the brain, put it in the computer, and bingo, a picture emerges of the Mona Lisa.

286
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:17,600
Fantastic. All the technology and science that we have now and coming in the future, they depend

287
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,760
on our computing power, correct? And from that perspective, we can say that our life and our

288
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,960
future now depends on silicon. But what's coming after silicon? What is the next generation of

289
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:36,560
computing? Is quantum computers a viable candidate? Yes. You realize that Silicon Valley could

290
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:42,800
eventually become a rust belt. If you drive through Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania, you see all

291
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:49,200
these closed factories because technology went ahead and the industry did not, and so we have a

292
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,720
rust belt. Silicon Valley could become a rust belt because one day the transistors of silicon

293
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:01,200
will become obsolete for two reasons, heat and leakage. So when transistors become so small

294
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:07,680
that they're the size of molecules, then molecules leak and molecules create tremendous

295
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:14,160
amounts of energy. The chip will melt as a consequence and short circuit because of leakage.

296
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:20,960
So we physicists are desperately trying to find a way to maintain computer power because we're so

297
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:27,120
used to Moore's law that computer power doubles every 18 months. But as George Harrison once said,

298
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:34,160
all things must pass even the age of silicon. So one day Silicon Valley will go bankrupt perhaps,

299
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:41,600
and technology will go someplace else where we have quantum computers and molecular computers

300
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:47,040
that compute on molecules and compute on individual atoms. However, we're not there yet,

301
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:54,320
and these technologies are not ready for prime time. What are your thoughts on education system?

302
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,680
Are we doing a good job training the new generation to deal with all these overly complex

303
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,080
new wave of change that is coming? And what do you see as a suitable education system for the age of

304
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:12,000
AI and automation? First of all, we're all born scientists. We're born wondering why the sun

305
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,560
shines. We're born wondering where we came from and why the stars twinkle. Then we encounter the

306
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:27,520
greatest destroyer of scientists known to science. It destroys thousands of scientists. This destroyer

307
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:36,080
of scientists is junior high school. Even as we speak, thousands of junior high school kids have

308
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,920
been turned off to science because they're taking their first courses in science, and science is

309
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:49,840
made boring. It's made into memorization. Learn the parts of a flower. I mean, memorize the moons

310
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:56,080
of Jupiter. I mean, who cares? I'm a scientist. I never have to look up the parts of a flyer.

311
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,720
You just go to the internet, and there it is. In fact, in the future, the internet is going to be

312
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,640
inside your contact lens. You'll blink, and you'll be online, and there's the periodic chart. So why

313
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:12,080
do you bother to memorize all the elements of the periodic chart? You have to use the chart,

314
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:18,720
not memorize the chart. And so I think that we should revamp junior high school because

315
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:25,200
that's where we lose millions, millions of scientists. It also has a lot to do with the

316
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:32,480
society, right? Because every kind of technological innovation works as good as a society that adapts

317
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:40,480
it. So when we're lacking in education, we're practically building a society that can be fooled

318
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,680
by a lot of false information. And I just want to go back to democracy, that when they can't vote,

319
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:51,120
and the voting power is equal, if somebody believes that they've been abducted by aliens,

320
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:59,360
they can neutralize some scientist votes. Well, what we can do is change our curriculum,

321
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:07,360
because our colleges and high schools do a good job of graduating students to live in 1950.

322
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:14,240
The only problem is, we don't live in 1950 anymore. But the curriculum is so stale, so

323
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:21,120
so backward, and yet that's what we teach our kids. For example, sometimes I teach physics for pre-meds.

324
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,400
These are the people who are going to be operating on you using the most advanced MRI scans and PET

325
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:32,800
scans and EKG scans, right? What do I teach them about MRI scans and PET scans and all,

326
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,240
and radiomedicine and advanced cancer research? No, the book says I have to teach them about

327
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:46,400
friction, tuning forks, levers, and pulleys. Now, they were important 300 years ago, but we moved on.

328
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:53,200
We've moved on since 300 years ago. But there I am teaching them about things that were very

329
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:59,200
interesting 300 years ago, but are not cutting edge anymore. But that's how we teach physics to

330
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,360
medical students. Are you telling them that what you're teaching them is? Yeah, we teach them

331
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:08,320
Newtonian knowledge, but we've gone way past Newton. We're into the age of Einstein. We're into

332
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,440
the age of electricity and computers and high-tech, but we don't teach that stuff. And so when you go

333
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:20,080
to a laboratory, I talk to the doctors there. They're clueless. They don't know how these things

334
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:24,880
work. They just know that they work. And as a consequence, we've had horrible accidents.

335
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,200
Cat scans, for example, hit you with a tremendous amount of radiation. It has to be done very

336
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,440
carefully by technicians. However, these technicians don't know up from down with the

337
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,920
radiation coming from the cat scan. And there are all these pictures of patients that have lost

338
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:44,000
their hair because of the enormous quantities of X-rays that hit their scalp. I mean, we find

339
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,800
these pictures in Hiroshima, but there we have hospitals where the patients look like victims

340
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:57,040
from Hiroshima because the technicians don't know how to calibrate cat scans. Wow.

341
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:02,560
There's a question from one of our listeners. How do you see the rise in the future of the private

342
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,960
sector involvement in the space industry? SpaceX would be a very good example of that.

343
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:18,000
Well, just realize that in 1966, the Apollo space program consumed 5% of the entire federal budget.

344
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,920
Now that's unsustainable. 5% of every tax dollar you pay in your income tax went to the space

345
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:31,520
program. So now prices are dropping like a rock. When you saw the movie The Martian with Matt Damon,

346
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:39,600
that movie cost $100 million. But the Indian sent a space probe to Mars for $70 million.

347
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:46,880
So you realize the Hollywood movies about going to Mars cost more than actually going to Mars.

348
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,400
So the Chinese, the Indians, they've all said that, yeah, they're going to put their flags in the

349
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:58,480
moon. So there's going to be a race. And are we up for it? Well, last month, millions of people

350
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,640
tuned in to watch the launching of the Falcon Heavy from Cape Canaveral. Why? It's just an

351
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:10,080
ordinary rocket for God's sake. We see them take off all the time, right? No, the Falcon Heavy was

352
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:18,560
a moon rocket, fully capable of sending astronauts to the moon. Now, this rocket was paid for, not by

353
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:26,240
taxpayers, but by a private individual, Elon Musk of Tesla Motors. This is incredible. Think about

354
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:33,200
that. A private individual opening up his checkbook and bankrolling a moon rocket, which could take

355
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:40,400
our astronauts to the moon. That's how much prices have dropped. And that's how much space has opened

356
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,400
up for the government and for private enterprise. And I think we're entering a new golden age.

357
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:52,960
A new golden age of space research, because prices have dropped. In fact, it takes three days to go

358
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:59,040
to the moon, one week for a round trip to the moon. I think in the future, our grandkids may

359
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:05,120
honeymoon on the moon. That's how close the moon is. Well, honeymoon on the moon. Mars, of course,

360
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:12,000
is farther away, but the moon will be for tourists in the future. I actually drove up to Kennedy

361
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,920
Center for the launch of Falcon Heavy, and that was the first launch that I was seeing, and it

362
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,880
was the most incredible experience of my life. Those two Falcons coming back down and just

363
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:29,200
watching science fiction. And something that was very encouraging was how engaged and how excited

364
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,080
people of different age groups are, and there were thousands of people there. Yes. So we're entering,

365
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:41,920
I think, a new era in space exploration, that the old days when space was considered very, very

366
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,400
expensive, and only Russia and the United States could do it, those days are gone. We're talking

367
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,800
about private entrepreneurs. You realize the richest man in the world, Jeff Bezos of Amazon,

368
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,560
he has created his own spaceport in Texas. He doesn't even bother to go to Cape Canaveral.

369
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:02,720
He shoots his rockets from his own spaceport. And Google, Google has created a space port

370
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,600
and Google, Google billionaires not to be left behind, they're jumping into the game. They want

371
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:13,360
to mine the asteroid belt. It's a whole new ball game out there. And that's why one of the reasons

372
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:19,600
why I wrote the book, to teach people that, hey, we're entering a new golden age of space

373
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:25,840
exploration. Prices have dropped. Countries like India and China are jumping in the game.

374
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,280
Silicon Valley billionaires are underwriting the cost of it. I mean, we're going to go to the stars.

375
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,840
Do you see governments on the way of progress at this point? I mean,

376
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,480
what we're talking about now and what's happening with SpaceX and all the great

377
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,680
things with technology and science. Meanwhile, we watch in Congress and Senate what they're

378
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:51,200
talking about, you know, businessmen and lawyers. Yeah, well, I think there's going to be a mix.

379
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,760
Private enterprise has a definite role to play because taxpayers don't have to foot the bill.

380
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:05,360
And they in turn want to have a return by mining operations when they go to the moon and Mars.

381
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:13,920
And I think a union between government financing and private enterprise is what's new with this

382
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,720
new space race. We're basically going to be competing against ourselves and we're going

383
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:24,880
to be doing it safely and cheaply, which was not the way it was during the Cold War.

384
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:30,880
I'm really curious to know your interpretation of two quotes. One is by Albert Einstein and the

385
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,800
other is by Nikola Tesla. Einstein said, nature shows us only the tail of the lion, but there is

386
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:42,800
no doubt in my mind that the lion belongs with it, even if he cannot reveal himself to the eye all

387
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:49,040
at once because of his huge dimension. And then Tesla said, my brain is only a receiver. In the

388
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:54,720
universe, there is a core from which we obtain knowledge, strength and inspiration. I have not

389
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:59,760
penetrated into the secret of this core, but I know it exists. Are these quotes talking about

390
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,880
the same thing? In your opinion? In other words, is the core that Tesla talks about the same as

391
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:11,280
Einstein's lion dimension? Well, I think there's similarities. I think geniuses somewhat think the

392
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,800
same way. They're talking about the theory of everything. When Einstein looked at the claw,

393
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,800
he was talking about gravity. But he said that gravity must be connected to a much greater thing

394
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:28,560
because look at light. Light is different from gravity. The other paw is light. So why should

395
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:34,080
this lion have two paws? There must be a head, there must be a tail and other legs. And that,

396
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:40,400
he thought, was the unified field theory. And Tesla too was tinkering with this idea that there's

397
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:47,120
something out there. He thought maybe it was a vacuum that contained the secrets of our existence.

398
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:52,560
And now we realize that, well, yes, the vacuum does have energy. It's called dark energy. And

399
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:59,040
that's the energy of the Big Bang. That's what's causing the expanding universe. And so if you

400
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:05,360
understand this energy of nothing, the energy of the vacuum, then in some sense, you can understand

401
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:11,200
the deepest secrets of the universe. That is the unified field theory, which is what I do for a

402
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:17,840
living. Would that be considered the end of physics? No, just because you are watching a chess

403
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:24,400
game, and you slowly figured out how the pawns move and how the bishops move. That doesn't mean

404
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,960
you're a grand master. That doesn't mean you're a master of chess. No, it just means you know how

405
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:34,480
the pawns move and how the bishops move. And so I think even if we do have the theory of everything,

406
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:40,000
that's just the beginning. Because look, think of all the questions we can answer with the theory of

407
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:46,400
everything. Is time travel possible? Einstein's equations say yes, but is it really practical?

408
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,440
String theory will answer that question. Wormholes. Can we have gateways of the universes?

409
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:57,840
What happened before the Big Bang? Is there a multiverse of universes? All these questions

410
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:05,120
are way beyond Einstein's theory, but that's exactly what string theory can do. String theory

411
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:10,400
in principle can answer these questions about parallel universes, time travel, wormholes,

412
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,960
the multiverse. So once we have the unified field theory, that's just the beginning.

413
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:20,960
I just want to know very quickly your thoughts on the simulation theory as well.

414
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:26,800
Sure. What are your thoughts on simulation theory? Well, many people saw the movie The Matrix,

415
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:34,480
and they thought to themselves, wow, can reality be uploaded into our minds? Is the universe nothing

416
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:40,160
but a simulation? In other words, did God put a CD into a CD player and hit the play button?

417
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:47,280
Once you hit the play button, here we are acting as if we have free will, acting as if we know

418
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,640
what we're doing, but we're just puppets. We're just puppets dancing on the computer screen

419
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:58,960
just because somebody hit the play button. Is that reality? I don't think so for the following

420
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:06,000
reason. If we were to have a computer to simulate the weather, the computer would have to be

421
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:13,680
enormous in size just because there's so many molecules inside the weather. In fact, the

422
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:22,400
smallest object that can simulate the weather is the weather itself. So the smallest object that

423
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:28,320
can model the universe is the universe itself. Now that's using Newton's equations, assuming that

424
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:35,360
atoms are hard steel balls. Quantum mechanics says no. Quantum mechanics says that these balls can

425
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:40,960
be everywhere at the same time, which of course violates common sense, but who cares about your

426
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:48,080
common sense? So we're in a situation now where quantum mechanics makes many more possible

427
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:54,320
universes than Newton's equations. So if Newton's equations cannot be simulated except by Newton's

428
00:44:54,320 --> 00:45:00,080
equations themselves, then what chance do we have of doing this with quantum mechanics? So that's

429
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:06,160
why I do not think we are a simulation. We have free will and we're not marionettes dancing just

430
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:11,840
because somebody hit the play button. Well, Dr. Kakou, this has been a pleasure and an honor to

431
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:16,480
speak with you. Allow me to ask you the last question that I ask all my guests, that if you

432
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:22,560
come across an intelligent alien from a different civilization, what would you say as the worst thing

433
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:28,880
humanity has done and what would you say as our greatest achievement? Well, I would say our worst

434
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:35,360
achievement is our ability to self-destruct. We have all these self-inflicted problems like global

435
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:41,680
warming, nuclear proliferation, and germ warfare that could end this great experiment called

436
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:50,800
humanity. But on the positive side, I side with the words of General Eisenhower who once said that

437
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:58,240
pessimists never win wars. Only optimists win wars. Only optimists change history. And because

438
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:05,280
we are sentient, because we have self-consciousness, we are masters of our fate. And I think one

439
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:13,440
possible destiny for us is to become a star-faring species, that is to reach for the stars.

440
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:45,440
Thank you.
